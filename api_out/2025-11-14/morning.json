But the realities of a persistent  affordability crisis , low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly.\n \n\n   \n  Although still in the early stages, Trump’s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items.\n \n\n   \n  Each tactic comes with significant question marks – and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans’ finances even more.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan A\n \n\n   \n  The original Trump economic plan was based on  three bold assumptions :\n \n\n   \n  For the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That’s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over.\n \n\n   \n  As it turns out, some parts didn’t work.\n \n\n   \n  Boosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven’t fallen – they’ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  High-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Bond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans has  doubled over the past four years , according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  It may be early to judge Trump’s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recent  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month’s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters’ minds when they went the polls.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan B\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new plan is emerging.\n \n\n   \n   Tariff dividends:  Trump last weekend floated the idea of  $2,000 tariff rebate checks , a proposal he’s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered.\n \n\n   \n  Using tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more,  exacerbating inflation .\n \n\n   \n   50-year mortgages:  Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a  50-year mortgage , which could lower homebuyers’ monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  But critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowers  never actually own their homes . Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump.\n \n\n   \n  All of that could harm Americans’ long-term financial security.\n \n\n   \n   Portable mortgages:  Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering a  portable mortgage , which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move – even as current mortgage rates remain high.\n \n\n   \n  But industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way.\n \n\n   \n   Lowering some tariffs:  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announce  lower tariffs on produce  that isn’t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n  That could reduce import prices, but it probably won’t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans’ fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won’t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures.\n \n\n   \n    Make America Affordable Again\n \n\n   \n  A significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump’s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the administration’s policies may be exacerbating the so-called  K-shaped economy , in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasingly  live paycheck to paycheck. \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s immediate reaction to the GOP’s election losses and new polls was denialism: He  claimed, falsely , that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN’s Alayna Treene  that Trump is getting more frequent economic briefings  and has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies.\n \n\n   \n  And Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: “Make America Affordable Again.” The devil, as always, will be in the details.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/john-beam-laney-college-shooting-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:58:00-05:00","title":"John Beam, Former Football Coach Featured in 'Last Chance U,' Shot on Oakland College Campus","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former football coach and athletic director John Beam, a beloved figure in the Bay Area and featured in Netflix's 'Last Chance U,' was shot on the campus of Laney College in Oakland on Thursday, November 14, 2025, just before midday.

immigrants \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:33 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the  drivers were legally allowed  to be in the US, state officials said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public’s consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the US made an illegal U-turn and caused a  crash in Florid a that killed three people.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California’s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver’s licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we’ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,” Duffy said, referring to the state’s governor. “This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person’s legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Newsom’s spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver’s licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed.\n \n\n   \n  The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy revoked $40 million in  federal funding  because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state’s effort to comply.\n \n\n   \n  The new rules for commercial driver’s licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa.\n \n\n   \n  H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a US business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n \n\n   \n  Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn’t have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver’s work permit expired — sometimes years after.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said the state followed guidance it received from the US Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/oklahoma-gas-leak-ammonia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:16:00-05:00","title":"Ammonia Gas Leak from a Tanker Truck in Oklahoma Sickens Dozens and Forces Evacuations","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A dangerous anhydrous ammonia leak occurred from a tanker truck parked behind a Holiday Inn Express in Weatherford, Oklahoma, on Wednesday night, causing a severe gas exposure that led to hundreds of evacuations, dozens of hospitalizations, and several critical injuries.

Associated Press, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:16 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A leaking tanker truck spewed dangerous ammonia gas outside a hotel overnight, filling its hallways with fumes and forcing hundreds of nearby residents of a small Oklahoma city to evacuate, authorities said Thursday. Several dozen people were treated at hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  Officials lifted a shelter-in-place order Thursday morning, hours after firefighters wearing gas masks went door to door in Weatherford, waking people up and telling them to leave because of the anhydrous ammonia leak.\n \n\n   \n  An oil field worker staying at the hotel where the truck had been parked said he heard a “faint pop” Wednesday night and noticed a smell minutes later. He and a coworker left their room and hustled into a hallway and then an elevator filling up with a pungent odor.\n \n\n   \n  Once outside, they saw their vehicles underneath a cloud of ammonia, said Michael Johnson, of Nacogdoches, Texas. “The smell itself punched me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He took off running, but noticed his roommate wasn’t with him and saw that he had run for their trucks. He said a police officer managed to save his coworker.\n \n\n   \n  “His lips were purple and frozen shut,” Johnson said. “His eyes were bloodshot red. His skin was all red.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson found one person stumbling and gave him a shirt to put over his mouth. At one point, he looked at the smoke and saw they were surrounded, thinking “We’re going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers.\n \n\n   \n  Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day.\n \n\n   \n  A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating.\n \n\n   \n  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago,  five people died  in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan.\n \n\n   \n  The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials.\n \n\n   \n  The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.”\n \n\n   \n  The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part. I know it’s your house, but you really have to go.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/media/bbc-apologizes-trump-documentary-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:53:00-05:00","title":"BBC Apologizes to Trump over Editing Blunder, Rejects Defamation Claim","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC apologized to US President Donald Trump over an editing error in a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?', where a segment of his January 6, 2021 speech was altered to show him saying 'we fight like hell,' which did not appear in the original speech.

documentary that Trump’s lawyers described as false and defamatory, seeking to defuse a row that has plunged the public broadcaster into its  worst crisis in years .\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson said that lawyers for the broadcaster had written to Trump’s legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President (Donald) Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any BBC platforms while rejecting that it was defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s arguments as to why it believes it does not have a case to answer, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip not meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the October 2024 documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday. He is yet to respond to the BBC apology.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC had already apologized for an error of judgment in the documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, but not before it had ignited a scandal that saw the resignations of its director-general and head of news.\n \n\n   \n  In the documentary, Trump’s January 6 speech was edited to show him saying: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the US leader said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” with “fight like hell” coming 54 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Trump said the British broadcaster had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday,  the Telegraph newspaper  accused the BBC of similarly editing the same speech in a 2022 episode of the show Newsnight, again making it look like Trump was encouraging his followers to “fight like hell” in the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the broadcaster said that “the BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards,” adding that the matter “has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s board has been criticized for responding too slowly to the editing error, which was revealed in a leaked internal memo that has created a firestorm of criticism and allegations of systemic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Deborah Turness, the outgoing CEO of BBC News who resigned on Sunday, has said that while mistakes were made, “allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to BBC News staff following her resignation, Turness said that the backlash surrounding the Trump documentary had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC that the broadcaster was “right to apologize for what were serious mistakes.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked if she believed the BBC is “doomed” if it loses the public’s trust, the official said that the organization “is and remains the most trusted source of news in this country, and one of the top five most trusted sources of news all over the world.”\n \n\n   \n  When it makes mistakes, the BBC must be “willing and able to respond to that level of challenge and to put in place changes, because that trust is something that is essential, it’s vital, it’s precious, and it must be protected,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The British public broadcaster’s next steps are not immediately clear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment when reached by CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/republicans-scramble-health-care-obamacare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Republicans scramble for health care plan, as Democrats eye midterm battle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expire in weeks, Republicans are under intense pressure to develop a health care plan to prevent a surge in insurance costs and avoid political defeat in the 2027 midterms.

\nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans in Washington successfully  defused the 43-day government shutdown  without surrendering to Democrats’ demands to spend billions more to offset spiking health insurance costs.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the GOP is under mounting pressure to figure out its own plan.\n \n\n   \n  Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire in just weeks – which would  more than double  the cost of premiums nationally for tens of millions of Americans. And it’s causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the White House, officials are accelerating efforts to put together a new health care plan that fulfills  President Donald Trump ’s desire to take another shot at overhauling Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  Those early discussions have sought to balance Trump’s demands against the broader Republican Party’s wariness of waging another politically disastrous health care war, four people familiar with the matter said. Officials are debating a limited package of conservative health care changes, including eliminating the enhanced ACA subsidies in favor of funneling money directly to Americans — potentially through an expansion of health savings accounts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, are closely watching the GOP’s plans, which they believe will never pass Congress – giving them a huge political boost and possibly delivering them control of the House in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of the GOP’s plans is fueling anxiety for Republicans like Rep. Jeff Van Drew, the outspoken populist from New Jersey who has repeatedly urged party leaders to give some relief for those Obamacare premiums or face voters’ wrath next November.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a whole bunch [of ideas] that are out there,” Van Drew said, ticking off proposals such as Trump’s idea to give money directly to consumers to buy plans. “The question is, can we get them done on time, to really not hurt people in the United States of America?”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another reason Van Drew is worrying. Time is running short and he said GOP leaders have been tight-lipped on their plans: “A lot of members haven’t seen any of this.”\n \n\n   \n  He isn’t the only one sounding the alarm. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — who has drawn the ire of Trump himself for her criticism of the party — has been repeatedly warning of a health care catastrophe of the GOP’s own making if Congress doesn’t act.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s my problem. Republicans have never fixed it,” Greene said of Obamacare in an interview with “The Sean Spicer Show.” She said Republicans need to act to make sure “the American people aren’t driving 80 miles per hour off a brick wall and hitting a financial crisis which is what’s actually happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the GOP’s leadership ranks,  there’s an acknowledgement  they need to do something on health care affordability. But those party leaders are also staunchly opposed to renewing those subsidies, which they insist simply funds insurance companies and props up a failed law.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, House GOP leaders are assembling their own slate of health care bills — though exactly which ones have yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pulling together the best ideas that we can, in the quickest fashion, to bring premiums down,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Wednesday night, the same day the House returned from a six-week recess during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  White House aides have similarly indicated that they will soon have a concrete plan, insisting that the administration plans to play a central role in directing the GOP’s health care strategy amid deepening concerns over Trump’s standing on the economy and affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to further expanding health savings accounts, officials have weighed a range of existing conservative policy ideas aimed at expanding patients’ health care options and lowering costs — including loosening certain Obamacare guardrails and giving states greater flexibility to customize their health insurance marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Yet many of those proposals have proven unpopular with voters in the past, and fall well short of Trump’s vow to “forget this Obamacare madness” altogether. And as the midterm outlook worsens for the GOP, some in the party still plan to push for a simpler compromise on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  There are at least a dozen House Republicans who do support temporarily extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies, many of them from battleground districts that will be key to GOP control of the chamber next year. Virginia Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans has been particularly vocal on the issue, drafting a bill to extend the subsidies for one year that’s gotten a dozen GOP cosponsors.\n \n\n   \n  Kiggans and her cosponsors are already working to plot a path forward: Staff of several of those members on the bill will meet Thursday to discuss next steps, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Another swing-seat Republican backing the bill, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Senate leaders Thursday seeking bipartisan talks to work on a bill extending those Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But even some House moderates privately acknowledge that it’s unlikely any provision that upholds Obamacare can pass the GOP chamber. Even if the bill would win Democratic votes, GOP leaders know there is fierce resistance to any Obamacare bill and would refuse to put it on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also grown increasingly opposed to continuing the subsidies despite the political peril, with one of the people familiar with the matter characterizing the president as “on fire” over the issue. Though administration officials during the shutdown’s first weeks had weighed supporting a short-term extension that would phase out the subsidies over time, that idea has since appeared to lose steam, the people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump in recent days has instead repeatedly disparaged the tax credits as a “disaster” and latched onto arguments made by conservative allies that they largely amount to a windfall for insurance companies.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jim Jordan, the influential House Judiciary chairman, for instance, entirely dismissed the idea of extending the subsidies when pressed by CNN if he could accept any plan that kept them in place.\n \n\n   \n  “If Obamacare was so wonderful, why do we need to keep extending the expanded subsidies?” the Ohio Republican said. ”This is an expansion of Obamacare.”\n \n\n   \n  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, too, argued that any extension of the subsidies would be simply a move to “prop up a failed Obamacare fund.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Affordable Care Act has failed miserably at being affordable. That is a broken model. We want to give people options that lower their premiums, not just shovel more money to insurance companies,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/china/shenzhou-20-crew-return-earth-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Chinese astronauts arrive home after suspected debris strike delays return to Earth","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three Chinese astronauts from the Shenzhou-20 mission returned to Earth on November 14, 2025, more than a week late due to a suspected debris impact that caused a crack in their return capsule's window.

  7:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window.\n \n\n   \n  The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China’s Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they’d even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.\n \n\n   \n  But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).\n \n\n   \n  Medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  “The path of humanity’s exploration of space is not smooth,” Chen Dong, one of the astronauts, told journalists in front of the capsule. “It is full of difficulties and challenges, and that is also why we choose to walk this path.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very proud that we successfully completed the mission…We have finally made it home safely.”\n \n\n   \n  The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China’s Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.\n \n\n   \n  Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a  nine-hour sortie , and it’s about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.\n \n\n   \n  The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.\n \n\n   \n  The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed  bans on Chinese citizens  with US visas participating in NASA programs.\n \n\n   \n  The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually  returned home  in March.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/ukraine-russia-assassination-attempt-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:37:00-04:00","title":"Russia claims to have thwarted Ukrainian assassination plot as deadly overnight strikes pound Kyiv","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) claims it thwarted a Ukrainian plan to assassinate a high-ranking Russian official inside Moscow, during a visit to a cemetery.

night of deadly Russian aerial attacks that killed at least six people, according to Ukrainian officials.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian special services were planning to target the unnamed official, described as “one of the highest-ranking officials of the Russian state,” while he was visiting the graves of his relatives at a cemetery outside Moscow, according to a Friday statement by Russia’s FSB.\n \n\n   \n  The FSB also claimed in its statement that Ukraine is planning similar attacks inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  CNN could not independently verify Russia’s claims.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.\n \n\n   \n  “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”\n \n\n   \n  A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,   diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.\n \n\n   \n  The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.\n \n\n   \n    What is telogen effluvium?\n \n\n   \n  There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.\n \n\n   \n  “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”\n \n\n   \n  When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.\n \n\n   \n  Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.\n \n\n   \n    Malnutrition may play a role\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.\n \n\n   \n  Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”   \n \n\n   \n  Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”\n \n\n   \n    Other theories\n \n\n   \n  There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.\n \n\n   \n  Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”\n \n\n   \n  Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum points to a  study  in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.\n \n\n   \n  “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.\n \n\n   \n  “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”\n \n\n   \n  A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.\n \n\n   \n  “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”\n \n\n   \n    Treatments for hair loss\n \n\n   \n  Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”\n \n\n   \n  That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.\n \n\n   \n  “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth. In androgenetic alopecia, we’re looking at more long-term therapies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.\n \n\n   \n  “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”\n \n\n   \n  Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-05:30","title":"Invest in crypto?

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by January 30, 2026 in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2025 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/signature-strike-drone-war-latin-america","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"‘Enemy KIA’: Trump revives playbook from Afghanistan for campaign targeting alleged drug boats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has launched a sweeping military campaign against suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, using tactics and terminology from the global war on terror.

\n       \n  By Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand, Priscilla Alvarez, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Deep below the US Capitol, in a secure room meant to protect discussions of American secrets, a wave of sarcastic laughter spread among lawmakers and staff members who were assembled to receive a briefing in late October from senior Pentagon officials.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy rear admiral and a top civilian adviser to the defense secretary had made the trip to Capitol Hill to walk lawmakers through an accelerating string of strikes that to date have  now claimed 80 lives . The attacks were part of a campaign the Trump administration says is aimed at disrupting the operations of drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  But in a meeting the lawmakers expected would center around growing concerns over whether the military had the legal right to kill traffickers without knowing their identities and without trial, the two Pentagon briefers had left something behind: the military lawyers who had been scheduled to attend.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of the sudden cancellation by the lawyers was immediately seen by some of the lawmakers as a classic stonewalling tactic – with no lawyers around, the Pentagon officials could claim ignorance on legal questions – triggering the wry laughs in the secure room.\n \n\n   \n  But what the Pentagon officials did have to say that day struck several attendees as deeply troubling. It was the way briefers described those killed in the operations – so-called enemy combatants – that seemed to provide evidence that the administration was dusting off the playbook of the drone war in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The briefers discussed the strikes against alleged drug boats in nearly identical terms as those carried out in the Middle East during the global war on terror: Killed in Action, target signature, enemy combatants.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, wait a minute, enemy KIA, what war are we talking about here? What declared conflict am I missing?” one source familiar with the briefing told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In that and other briefings with lawmakers, military officials have acknowledged they didn’t know the names of those killed, the exact destination of their vehicles or have the documentation to prosecute them for their alleged crimes. But the targets’ actions fit the intelligence of what the briefers referred to as “terrorist” activity and so they were labeled as “enemy KIA,” or killed in action, a phrase used for decades to represent troops perishing on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  The US spent more than a decade carrying out attacks, known as “signature strikes,” based on similar rough intelligence profiles as part of its drone campaign in the Middle East. But that campaign occurred during a period when US troops were routinely coming under enemy fire and were facing regular roadside bombings.\n \n\n   \n  US forces operating in and around Latin America have not reported taking fire, and the Pentagon has said no troops have been injured during its recent operations in the region. Nonetheless, the US military has conducted 20 strikes, destroying 21 boats while labeling those killed “narco-terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been explicit in drawing the comparison between terrorist groups and drug trafficking operations in Latin America, calling them the “Al-Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere.”\n \n\n   \n  “My advice to foreign terrorist organizations, do not get in a boat,” Hegseth said during a recent speech.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes against boats have used drones designed to carry hellfire missiles, the same combination of hardware that had been the backbone of the signature strike campaign in the Middle East, though CNN has reported that AC-130J gunships have also participated in some of the attacks in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  US officials have told Congress they do not need to identify individual targets before killing them – mirroring an argument made by past administrations to justify similar strikes against terror networks.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that a signature is misinterpreted or erroneous and an innocent party is attacked,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and a senior adviser with the CSIS Defense and Security Department.\n \n\n   \n  He described how signature strikes in the Middle East used traits of a target, and how that same logic could be applied to drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Caribbean, that means that if a vessel exhibits characteristics a, b, and c, then it is presumed to be running drugs,” he said, though he added, “It’s possible that the administration has more direct information and is not releasing that to avoid compromising sources and methods.”\n \n\n   \n  But unlike during the war on terror, the Trump administration lacks Congressional authorization for a sustained military campaign against alleged drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of an opinion produced by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers, a distinction with a very clear difference compared to terror groups that have been targeted in similar strikes.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Trump administration lawyers appear to be relying heavily on the President’s broad Article II authority – the section of the Constitution that outlines the role of the president including their command of the military.\n \n\n   \n  Taken together, the Trump administration is testing the bounds of its authority to wage war abroad – fueling concerns among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who continue to question the president’s legal justification for the strikes. It has also raised questions as to what lessons the administration and military may or may not have learned from the decadeslong conflict in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not reply to a request for comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  “How many briefings have I sat in at this point, where there’s some general or admiral sitting there and giving me vignettes about operations, and talking about the number of people they kill, enemy combatants they kill, their boats they blowing up, or tanks they’re blowing up, and how the mission was a success, and none of them could actually tell me what the strategy and endgame was and how they were going to measure success,” Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “And, so this is no different. I mean, they have learned nothing from our last 25 years, it seems,” Crow, who also served three tours in Iraq in Afghanistan and was an Army Ranger, added.\n \n\n   \n    Expansion of strikes\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s broader plan for the counter-drug campaign has not been articulated publicly, top officials have made clear that they intend to continue targeting smugglers using a similar playbook to the one used for killing terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  In practice, current and former US national security officials told CNN the two missions are not so different.\n \n\n   \n  “Network targeting is network targeting,” said one former US intelligence official with knowledge of the administration’s current strategy focused on dismantling drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, the “end state complicates things,” the former official added.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes against alleged drug boats started September 2, announced by President Donald Trump in a post on social media claiming that the boat was being operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. That first strike killed 11, Trump wrote, as he claimed that the gang was being directed by Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That was a theme in the early wave of strikes, as the Trump administration tried to tie Maduro to drug trafficking – namely fentanyl – while attacking boats near the Venezuelan coast in the Caribbean. It coincided with a massive buildup of military assets in the Caribbean, which now includes the Ford Carrier Strike Group and has raised questions about  whether the US intends to strike inside Venezuela  and potentially try to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  While those tensions continue to simmer, the boat strike campaign began to expand to the Pacific Ocean in late October, shifting focus from fentanyl to stopping the movement of cocaine. The announced targets also got less specific. Nearly all of the subsequent strikes including that first in the Pacific were against a “designated terrorist organization,” as announced by Hegseth, mirroring Global War on Terror framing of attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN also reported.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  But the shift to strikes in the Pacific has led to concerns from other countries in Latin America that the boat strike campaign signals a broadening that could only continue.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico has long been viewed by US officials as an epicenter of the drug trade, and Trump, himself, has repeatedly inquired about sending American troops across the southern border to target cartels based there.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s previous offers to send US forces into Mexico have been rebuffed, but the ongoing US military strikes have added a new wrinkle to the already delicate relationship between the two countries, as seen by an unexpected phone call on October 27.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Navy got a call from the Pentagon that day informing officials there may be a survivor in the Pacific Ocean from a US strike.\n \n\n   \n  The call — and the strike prompting it — surprised Mexico as US officials had provided no advance warning. While still in international waters, the incident happened near Mexico’s coast immediately raising concerns about the expansion of the US counter-narcotic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The two other known survivors from earlier strikes were briefly detained on a US Navy ship but ultimately repatriated to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia – amid questions about the legality of holding them, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  In Mexico City after the October 27 call, senior Mexican officials scheduled a meeting with the US ambassador to try to understand why Mexico, a close US partner working with the US on counter-drug operations already, was not aware of the strike and what to expect moving forward. A  readout of the meeting  described it as cordial and “aimed to strengthen bilateral coordination between Mexico and the Unted States on maritime matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Weeks later, the Mexican Navy has not located the survivor from that strike after having called off its formal search and the unnamed person is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Mexico has responded to Trump’s focus on the drug trade and framing of terrorist networks driving the trade by trying to placate the Trump administration with numbers— an effort begun well before the strikes commenced. In calls between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump, Sheinbaum has kept the US president updated on progress and metrics as it relates to crime. Trump administration officials said that the two leaders have developed a good relationship, despite Sheinbaum’s public opposition to the administration’s boat strikes, and continue to work together on multiple fronts.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that countries cooperatively working with the US on drug smuggling efforts should not be concerned about unilateral US strikes on smugglers from their nations.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to help us find these people and blow them up if that’s what it takes. They’re going to help us with it,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Working with allies\n \n\n   \n  While there are strengths to effectively conducting a counter-terrorism mission at the US border, namely using the full power of the US intelligence community and military to identify vulnerabilities within these various groups, multiple current and former officials told CNN there are also obvious pitfalls.\n \n\n   \n  Those include issues related to collateral damage and managing political outrage from countries that are increasingly concerned the US may violate their sovereignty by conducting lethal strikes within their borders.\n \n\n   \n  Those are similar challenges to what US officials grappled with during the global war on terror.\n \n\n   \n  The former US intelligence official compared the US-Mexico dynamic to that of dealing with Pakistan during that time. Initially, the US refrained from conducting unilateral operations inside Pakistan’s borders, spending years asking for permission before carrying out strikes against suspected terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan never said no, the former official said, and the US eventually moved into a phase of simply notifying the country rather than asking for permission before a strike.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Pakistan, however, the Mexican government has repeatedly said no to Trump when he has raised the prospect of deploying the US military inside the country to target drug groups.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US intelligence officials have insisted that they are collaborating with the Mexican government when it comes to countering the flow of drugs and that any military or covert action carried out across the border will not be done unilaterally.\n \n\n   \n  But that has done little to ease the concerns of Mexican officials who believe that decision, ultimately, lies solely with the President.\n \n\n   \n  While all of the strikes to date have been at sea targeting boats allegedly carrying drugs, lawyers in the Trump administration have been debating potential justifications to extend those strikes to land, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  One strategy they have debated would be to identify land targets the US believes to be associated with drug trafficking and justifying those strikes with a second legal opinion that declares the host country unable or unwilling to address an imminent threat to Americans, sources familiar with the administration’s thinking said. Another possibility is to add Mexican cartels to an existing, secret list of 24 cartels and criminal organizations that the administration argues are legitimate targets. There’s no indication that a decision to conduct land strikes has been made.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the ongoing strikes in international waters are straining relations between the US and allies.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s reporting, Columbia President Gustavo Petro announced that he had ordered the country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the US stops the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  It was the escalation of a public spat between Trump and Petro, who in Columbia leads a country that has been a critical partner in US efforts to combat drugs.\n \n\n   \n  That dispute reached a fever pitch when one of the two survivors of US strikes who is Colombian was repatriated.\n \n\n   \n  The man was subsequently released by Colombian authorities due to a lack of evidence that he was an alleged trafficker, according to Petro, who has continued to question the US strategy of shoot-first and ask questions later.\n \n\n   \n  “Colombia’s prosecutor’s office, independent of the government, cannot investigate without evidence. Thousands of people we captured on boats with the seized cocaine are tried in Colombia, but the method of killing them and not seizing the evidence does not allow for trials; at most, only bodies are collected, without really knowing what they were transporting,” Petro posted on social media.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-decision-nears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Clock is ticking ahead of NCAA’s decision on proposed gambling rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As sports gambling scandals spread across MLB, the NBA, and college basketball, the NCAA faces mounting pressure to decide on a proposed rule allowing college athletes and staff to bet on professional sports.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.\n \n\n   \n  But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense.\n \n\n   \n  Betting on college sports will remain a no-no.\n \n\n   \n  “This change recognizes the realities of today’s sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,’’ Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement.\n \n\n   \n  The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach.\n \n\n   \n  The timing created immediate blowback at the NCAA’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey wrote to NCAA president Charlie Baker, urging him to reconsider.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association’s commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,’’ Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process.\n \n\n   \n  It is worth noting that, of the 20 cabinet members who voted, and despite their commissioner’s protests, the two representing the SEC - Jeremiah Donati, the athletic director at South Carolina, and Matt Boyer, the SEC’s assistant commissioner for compliance - both voted in favor of the proposal per the NCAA committee’s report.\n \n\n   \n  Of the eight people representing the four power conferences (each of whose votes is weighted: 2.75 versus 1), both ACC representatives voted against the initial proposal, the Big Ten and SEC voted in favor, and the Big 12 split its vote.\n \n\n   \n  In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General’s office  announced  14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/weather/southern-california-storm-flooding-risk-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:06:00+00:00","title":"Flood, mudslide risk surges across Southern California as multi-day storm gets underway","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A strong Pacific storm is moving into Southern California, bringing heavy rainfall and significant risks of life-threatening flooding, mudslides, and debris flows—especially in burn scar areas from recent wildfires such as the Palisades, Hurst, and Sunset fires.

Southern California and ingredients are in place for potential life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area.\n \n\n   \n  The storm system

This round of rain is expected to ease by Friday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  A second, more intense wave will move into the region Friday night into Saturday, with prolonged heavy rain possible. Rainfall rates could be as high as an inch per hour at times.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through 10 p.m. Saturday.

Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have warned residents near the recent Palisades, Hurst and Sunset fires’ burn scars to be  prepared to evacuate .\n \n\n   \n  “Residents, especially those in vulnerable areas, should start taking precautions immediately to prepare for the storm and protect their interests,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. “This scenario would potentially create many significant impacts area-wide, including possible debris flows in the burn areas, significant ponding of roads and highways, mudslides through the canyons, fallen trees, etc.”\n \n\n   \n  Residents can  pick up sandbags at Fire Stations  throughout the City, with sand also available for free at select locations.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest rain should ease late Saturday, but the region isn’t in the clear right away. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won’t take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/eric-swalwell-mortgage-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00.000Z","title":"Bill Pulte refers Rep.

Following the incident, which caused diplomatic outrage and public backlash in South Korea, some workers have returned to resume their jobs. The battery plant, jointly operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution through HL-GA Battery Co., has resumed construction.

Hyundai site \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:23 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Two months after 300 South Korean nationals were detained and left the US following in an  immigration raid  at Hyundai’s electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia, some of those workers have returned to America to resume those jobs, their employer said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The September raid shut down work on a battery plant under construction at the sprawling site near Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group began producing electric vehicles last year.\n \n\n   \n   Most of the 475 workers detained  were South Korean nationals. US immigration officials said they entered the US with visas that had expired or with visa waivers that prohibited them from working.\n \n\n   \n  The battery plant’s operator, HL-GA Battery Co., said in a statement Thursday that construction has resumed with a mix of new and returning workers. The company thanked the US and South Korean governments, as well as Georgia officials, “for their collaboration in supporting a smooth and timely return.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain on track to start production in the first half of next year and continue to actively hire local positions to operate the facility,” the battery company’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  An HL-GA Battery spokesperson, Mary Beth Kennedy, confirmed to The Associated Press that some of the returning workers were among the South Korean nationals detained in September. Kennedy said she did not know how many.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 South Korean workers were detained in an immigration raid September 4 at the sprawling site where the Hyundai Motor Group produces electric vehicles near Savannah. The workers spent a week at a Georgia detention center before the South Korean government negotiated their release and flew them home.\n \n\n   \n  The roundup by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which released video showing some of the detained workers shackled in chains, sparked  outrage and feelings of betrayal  in South Korea, a key US ally that has pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in American investments.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia raid targeted one of the state’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where  Hyundai produces  electric vehicles at a $7.6 billion plant. The 475 people detained all worked at the battery plant, which will produce batteries to power Hyundai EVs. It is operated by HL-GA Battery, a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution.\n \n\n   \n  The South Korean nationals detained in Georgia were largely engineers and other highly skilled workers who came to the US temporarily to install equipment and perform other specialized work to get the battery plant up and running.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many of the formerly detained workers are coming back. Jongwon Lee, an attorney in metro Atlanta, said he has firsthand knowledge of two Korean nationals who plan to return after the US State Department confirmed that their B-1 business visitor visas were still valid.\n \n\n   \n  But Kihwan Kim, president of the Federation of Korean Associations for the Southeast US, said some of the workers snared in the raid are hesitant to return to the US.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t have to come to the United States to work after that kind of humiliation,” Kim said. “They can go to other countries.”\n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s government demanded improvements to the US visa system for skilled Korean workers. Last month, the South Korean Foreign Ministry announced that US officials had agreed to allow South Korean workers on short-term visas or a visa waiver program to help build industrial sites in America\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump initially defended the  immigration raid  in Georgia, saying in September that the detained workers “were here illegally, ” When asked about those workers again during an October visit to Seoul, Trump said: “I was  opposed  to getting them out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/air-travel-impact-government-reopening","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Government Reopens, But Air Travel Recovery Faces Uncertainty Amid Staffing Shortages and Back Pay Delays","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government reopened on November 14, 2025, after the longest shutdown in history, ending a period of widespread flight cancellations and safety concerns.

What’s that mean for air travel? \n       \n  By Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  People flying home for Thanksgiving this month have their list of things to be thankful for: the turkey, football, time with family. This year, they can also   add  H.R. 5371   to the list.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the funding bill President Donald Trump signed into law on Wednesday to reopen the government,  ending  the longest government shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after  cuts mandated  by the Federal Aviation Administration led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings”  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But before they get to say grace with family, travelers are now praying Bastian’s assessment is right, even as many questions remain about how quickly air traffic controller staffing will stabilize and when Transportation Security Administration workers will   get paid.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what we know about the plans to get more planes back up in the skies – and the uncertainty that remains.\n \n\n   \n    When will airlines stop canceling flights?\n \n\n   \n  The morning after the federal government reopened, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was filled with travelers keeping the hectic pace typical of the world’s busiest airport. But a closer look revealed something new: a palpable sense of relief in travelers.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that it will get back to some kind of normalcy or just a little bit better before the holidays,” Metreia White said, before boarding a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Hartsfield-Jackson is one of 40 major airports where airlines are still under  orders  from the FAA to cut   6% of their flights, many on shorter   regional routes . Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the cancellations have been necessary for safety because of air traffic controller staffing shortages during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Fridays and Saturdays have seen the most staffing problems throughout this time, according to data viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers missed  two paychecks  since   the shutdown started on  October 1 , and some are taking second jobs to make ends meet or calling in sick in protest.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been data-based,” Duffy said, citing examples of airplane mishaps at a  news conference  at Chicago O’Hare International Airport. “We’ve seen heightened complaints by pilots of the communication they’re having with air traffic controllers.”\n \n\n   \n  But “staffing levels …  improved dramatically ” when it became clear that a funding deal was coming, Bastian said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think our   air traffic controllers are seeing an end to the shutdown, and feel more hopeful, and they are coming in,” Duffy said on Tuesday. The  Department of Transportation  stopped short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers started showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain frozen at 6% until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  Logistics can also impact flight schedules, according to Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in a  statement  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Canceling one flight has a domino effect. They’ve had to move different airplanes in untraditional ways,” Sununu added at a news conference on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the challenges, airlines expect to rally quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a  statement  Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Southwest  said  on Wednesday they’re “seeing real progress, and air travel appears to be returning to normal. Our operation remains strong, and Customers can continue to count on Southwest.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines leaders told  employees  in a letter Thursday that they are optimistic about minimizing cancellations in time for the holiday.\n \n\n   \n  “It may take a few days for fully normal controller operations to resume, and we may need to continue to reduce schedules to comply with the FAA’s emergency order requirements,” wrote CEO Robert Ison and Chief Operating Officer David Seymour. “But we have seen promising signs and are confident that because of our strategic planning and work to minimize customer impacts throughout this period, we will recover quickly and deliver a strong Thanksgiving operation.”\n \n\n   \n    When do air traffic controllers get paid?\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday her team finished up the administrative work necessary “ late last night ” so TSA employees could receive back pay for paychecks missed during the government shutdown as soon as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve already missed pay periods and recognizing that that’s a hardship on their families,” Noem  said . “So we did all of the administrative work that we needed to late last night to ensure that payroll would be processed as soon as possible, and within the next coming days, they will get that into their bank accounts.”\n \n\n   \n  A DHS spokesperson told CNN the agency “will be working to expedite pay for all employees who were furloughed or working without pay in an excepted status.”\n \n\n   \n  Noem also announced some TSA employees who “stepped up every single day” and “served with exemplary service” through the federal government shutdown would receive a  $10,000 bonus check .\n \n\n   \n  “They were all examples of what we need and we will be continuing to not only recognize employees across the country, but we will be looking at every single TSA official that helped serve during this government shutdown and do what we can to recognize that and help them financially with a bonus check to get them and their family back on their feet,” the secretary said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Duffy  said  that air traffic controllers were expected to get 70% of their back pay “anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens,” with the remainder to come a week later.\n \n\n   \n  Technicians who work on air traffic control equipment are also awaiting their back pay, said David Spero, national president of their union, PASS National.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is going to take time,” said Spero. “We’re going to have people with ongoing pay issues for a while.”\n \n\n   \n  He also said the technicians who continued to maintain air traffic control equipment through the shutdown deserve recognition, too.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m looking into it and reaching out to FAA leadership now,” Spero said Thursday. “Not one delay in the last 43 days has been attributed to a system outage or an equipment problem.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the long-term impacts on travel?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have acknowledged losing millions of dollars of revenue from the canceled flights, and industry leaders said travelers were getting wary of putting money down on a trip that might not happen.\n \n\n   \n  “The consumer is pulling back,” said Sununu. “Typically, airlines and hotels can be a leading indicator of where folks are spending their money in the economy.”\n \n\n   \n  US  domestic flights  are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site  Going.com , but it’s not clear how those prices were affected by the flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  One bit of ironic luck for both airlines and passengers in the midst of this misfortune, according to the Delta CEO, is that all major carriers were   equally impacted, so the financial loss shouldn’t result in higher ticket prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a competitive marketplace,” said Bastian. “Everyone went through the same thing.”\n \n\n   \n  The airline industry says in the future, the government should guarantee the stability of the air travel system, even in a shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA’s  Airport and Airway Trust Fund  currently has $5 billion that could be used to pay air traffic controllers during future shutdowns,” Airlines for America said in a  statement . “We ask Congress to consider legislation that would implement a long-term solution.”\n \n\n   \n  There are other impacts too, that won’t be solved by the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit,  Duffy told reporters this week , while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n    Could this happen again in January?\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through  January .\n \n\n   \n  That means that airlines and passengers may be grounded again in three months.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does is kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, said it takes time to rebuild – both operations and morale – after disruptions like this to the travel industry.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot afford another self-inflicted crisis that threatens the systems millions rely on every day,” said Freeman.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Pete Muntean, Tami Luhby, Chris Boyette and Amanda Musa contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/chicago-immigration-arrests-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00+00:00","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Chicago’s Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, nominated by President Joe Biden, ruled that hundreds of people arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a federal immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas, must be released due to a violation of a 2022 settlement agreement on warrantless arrests.

arrested in Chicago’s immigration crackdown. What happens next? \n       \n  By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the latest judicial blow to President Donald Trump’s push to detain and  deport undocumented immigrants  en masse, a judge ruled Wednesday hundreds of people arrested in an Illinois immigration operation must be released.\n \n\n   \n  The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know – and what we don’t know – about what happens next.\n \n\n   \n    What did the judge decide?\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was  nominated by  former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022 settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Cummings ruled  agents violated the  previously agreed upon consent decree .\n \n\n   \n  Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026,  and says  if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility—which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri— they may be able to seek individual remedies—including immediate release from detention.”\n \n\n   \n    Who will be released and when?\n \n\n   \n  Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  But two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”\n \n\n   \n    What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.\n \n\n   \n  But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.\n \n\n   \n  “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n   “We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his CBP agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including  from a federal judge , for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin  previously told CNN , while  other immigration legal challenges  move through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago  amid protests against  the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Dianne Gallagher and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/middleeast/west-bank-mosque-graffiti-settlers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:48:00-05:00","title":"Israeli settlers torch mosque and spray graffiti in latest West Bank attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli settlers torched the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit, West Bank, and spray-painted it with racist graffiti, including 'Mohammed is a pig' and references to IDF commander Avi Bluth.

and spray graffiti in latest West Bank attack \n       \n  By Zeena Saifi, Ibrahim Dahman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:48 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli settlers torched a mosque and sprayed it with graffiti in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, according to Palestinian authorities, the latest in a surge of increasingly brazen settler attacks against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs said settlers attacked the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit in the northern West Bank, calling it a “heinous crime and a blatant assault on the feelings of Muslims.”\n \n\n   \n  “The attack resulted in parts of the mosque being set on fire and defaced with racist graffiti by settler gangs, who carry out daily assaults on Islamic holy sites and citizens’ properties amid a systematic escalation in both the frequency and nature of these violations,” the ministry statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The settlers attacked the mosque early Thursday before morning prayers, according to the Mayor of Deir Istiya.\n \n\n   \n  “Many houses and cars were not attacked, but rather the attack was on a religious symbol to provoke Muslims with offensive phrases against the Prophet [Muhammad] and Muslims,” Abdul Rahim Zidan said in an interview with state-run Palestine TV.\n \n\n   \n  Images shared by the ministry showed writing in Hebrew on the exterior of the mosque saying, “Mohammed is a pig,” a reference to Islam’s prophet, and “Not afraid of Avi Bluth.” Bluth is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commander in the West Bank, who issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the settler attacks and calling the perpetrators an “anarchist fringe youth.”\n \n\n   \n  Images showed parts of the interior damaged by fire, with a pile of charred debris scattered across the ground. The walls appear blackened with smoke and heat marks, and the glass of the windows smashed.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the attack in a statement, saying it “holds the Israeli government fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the IDF acknowledged the attack, saying it dispatched forces to the scene to “review the incident and conduct scans” and transferred the case to the Israel Police for further processing. The IDF said “no suspects were identified.”\n \n\n   \n  Some 700,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory the Palestinians want for a future state. Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are considered illegal according to international law.\n \n\n   \n    Record number of settler attacks\n \n\n   \n  Settler attacks on Palestinians and their properties have surged this year, particularly during the olive harvest season in October and November. A United Nations report released last week found that Israeli settlers launched  at least 264 attacks  in October, the largest number since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006. The repeated attacks have marred this year’s olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, dozens of Israeli settlers launched a major arson attack against an agricultural area in the northern West Bank village of Beit Lid, setting fire to a a new dairy factory and torching vehicles and tents in a nearby Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN showed the settlers pouring gasoline on cars and trucks before setting the vehicles alight. The video showed smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women wailing as men carry extinguishers and water buckets in a scramble to douse the fires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN visited the site of the attack and saw charred vehicles, and the damage left around the Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Monjed Aljuneidi, an executive of Al-Juneidi Dairy and Food Company said the scene was “indescribable.” He recalled dozens of settlers scaling the factory fences from multiple directions.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was just a message to scare us, to scare our employees… to try to enforce their reality on the ground… (but) we will continue operations, they can’t stop us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf, residents told CNN at least four Palestinians were injured and required hospitalization from the attack. They said settlers beat them and killed four of their sheep.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen-year-old Nabil Dueis was tending to his livestock when the settlers rampaged the area.\n \n\n   \n  “It was terrifying, especially for the women and children…I was defensless against 100 of them…we need protection from the state” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  According to the IDF, the settlers then attacked Israeli soldiers and damaged and Israeli military vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Police initially said it had arrested four suspects for questioning following what it called “extreme violence.” at the site. But by Wednesday evening, police said they had released three of the suspects.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian foreign ministry said the series of attacks “affirms the increasing terrorism and crimes of the settlers, carried out with the direct support of the occupation government, as part of a systematic and widespread policy aimed at undermining the rights of the Palestinian people.”\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian officials called on international and Islamic institutions to take action to ensure accountability.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/entertainment/latin-grammys-2025-winners-list","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:07:00+00:00","title":"Latin Grammys 2025: See who won","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Latin Grammys celebrated excellence in Latin music with a range of wins across categories, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist.

LaMonica McIver, who was  charged with assaulting federal agents  during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her  May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center  in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  The case is a high-profile clash between Trump’s second administration and a Democratic lawmaker who has been sharply critical of the president’s policies. McIver  has pleaded not guilty  and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  The acting US attorney in New Jersey,  Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision is pending.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident.\n \n\n   \n  A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a  2019 appropriations bill  spelling out that authority.\n \n\n   \n  McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/science/hitler-dna-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:23:00.000-05:00","title":"Researchers Say They Have Verified and Sequenced Hitler’s DNA: A Documentary Reveals Findings","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A team led by geneticist Turi King has analyzed a blood-stained fragment of fabric from Adolf Hitler’s bunker in 1945, claiming to have verified and sequenced DNA believed to belong to the Nazi leader.

A new documentary reveals the findings \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:23 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Researchers have analyzed a sample of DNA believed to belong to Adolf Hitler, which they say reveals the dictator of Nazi Germany had a genetic marker for a rare disorder that can delay puberty, according to a new documentary.\n \n\n   \n  The research, which took more than four years to complete, was led by geneticist Turi King, a professor at the UK’s University of Bath who is known for identifying the  remains of King Richard III . King said she verified that a piece of material taken from a couch in the bunker where Hitler shot himself in 1945 was soaked in the dictator’s blood by comparing a DNA sample recovered from the blood with a confirmed relative of Hitler’s.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to suggesting the possibility that Hitler had a hormone-disrupting congenital condition called  Kallmann syndrome , the documentary examined rumors that the dictator had Jewish ancestry and looked at whether he had a genetic predisposition to certain mental health conditions. Called “Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,” the documentary premieres Saturday on Channel 4 in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  However, the findings shared in the documentary haven’t been reviewed by other scientists in the field or published in a scientific journal, making it hard for experts not involved in the project to evaluate the validity of its assertions. King said that the analysis had been submitted to a “high-profile” journal and said she hopes the work will be published soon.\n \n\n   \n  The small patch of frayed fabric started its journey in 1945 in the hands of US Army Col. Roswell P. Rosengren, who was communications officer for Gen. Dwight D Eisenhower. When Rosengren was allowed into Hitler’s bunker by Soviet forces, he cut a swatch of material from a bloodstained couch, according to the documentary. The swatch stayed in Rosengren’s family before being put up for sale at auction in 2014 and purchased by the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t know what we were going to find,” King said. “It could have been the most boring genome on the planet, but it has been incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The most striking finding from the team’s analysis was that Hitler had a mutation on a gene called PROK2. Variants in this gene  are a cause of Kallmann syndrome  and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, King  said. In boys, these conditions   can delay puberty and cause undescended testicles.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, they are characterized by low testosterone levels. You either don’t go through puberty or you go through a partial puberty … 5% of cases get associated with a  micropenis , ”    King said, referring to a small but normally structured penis.\n \n\n   \n    Clues in the historical record\n \n\n   \n  At the time of his death, Hitler was observed at the end of the sofa with a gun and blood splattered on the couch and the wall behind him, said Nicholas F. Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist with the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History. He examined parts of the sofa, which is now in Russia, in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  “If the provenance of the sofa material used is confirmed to have come from the Bunker and from the settee that Hitler and  Eva Braun  died on, then the likelihood of the blood having come from Hitler is very good,” Bellantoni said by email.\n \n\n   \n  The new details that King put forth appear to align with the historical record, according to Alex Kay, an expert on Nazi Germany and senior lecturer at the Chair of War Studies at Germany’s University of Potsdam. Kay also appeared in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that a medical document from Hitler’s stay in prison after a failed coup known as the Munich  beer hall putsch  in 1923 suggested the dictator had right-side cryptorchidism — a condition in which a testicle fails to descend into the scrotum.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of Kallmann syndrome is, for me, personally, as a historian and as somebody who has spent more than 20 years researching the Nazis, a major finding,” Kay said. He added the information potentially explained Hitler’s lack of personal relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Kay and King said the findings also put to rest lingering rumors that Hitler had Jewish ancestry — speculation that stemmed from Hitler’s grandmother becoming pregnant while working in a Jewish household, according to the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Because the Y chromosome data analyzed in the research matched the DNA of Hitler’s male line relative, King said it’s not possible Hitler had Jewish ancestry. “If that was the case, we wouldn’t have got the DNA match with him,” King said. “That DNA match not only confirmed that this is Hitler’s DNA but also confirms that that story of human Jewish ancestry through his father is just simply not true.”\n \n\n   \n    The value of historical DNA\n \n\n   \n  King said she had some initial reservations about taking part in the documentary but decided to participate because she felt her expertise would   ensure that the analysis was scientifically rigorous. “This is also not just a documentary but an academic paper,” she said, adding she had no publication date to offer.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have previously used DNA to study well-known historical figures. Beethoven’s DNA, recovered from a lock of hair, revealed that the  composer had health issues . Archaeologists also widely use ancient DNA from human remains.\n \n\n   \n  However, without information on the quality of the genome, the raw data or how the analyses were done, it is not possible to assess the assertions made in the documentary, according to Pontus Skoglund, senior group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n \n\n   \n  “Stepping back, the scientific value of a media campaign such as this balanced against the possible stigmatization of individuals with these real diseases today can also be questioned,” Skoglund said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the researchers could have shared the findings with the scientific community on what’s known as a preprint server before a formal peer review and publication in an established journal.\n \n\n   \n  It’s plausible that historical DNA could be extracted from the piece of cloth, but there has to be good justification for studying the DNA from historical figures and a defined set of questions, said Tom Booth, Skoglund’s colleague and a bioarchaeologist at the Francis Crick Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “There are extensive historical records documenting the behaviour of Hitler in public and private,” Booth said via email. “(H)e is probably one of the most intensively studied figures in history, so I think it’s difficult to argue the DNA evidence adds much in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  “Even the Kallmann syndrome diagnosis might not be as straightforward as the headlines suggest. There can be a lot of variation in how it manifests physically, and while it is a plausible explanation for his undescended testicle, it doesn’t justify the amount of ‘micropenis’ in my newsfeed.” \n \n\n   \n    A ‘small, small puzzle piece’\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also said they calculated a polygenic risk score, which involves sifting through a person’s DNA to quantify disease risk. Their findings suggested that Hitler had an increased genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.\n \n\n   \n  However, polygenic risk score is a tool used today for research purposes — it’s not diagnostic and doesn’t mean that Hitler necessarily had these conditions, said Ditte Demontis, a professor in psychiatric genetics at Denmark’s Aarhus University, who was involved in the research and appears in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  “Currently, we are at a state where polygenic risk scores for psychiatric conditions are only used in the context of research,” Demontis emphasized. “We can say something at a group level but not an individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Demontis compared Hitler’s polygenic risk score with those of 30,000 Danish people and found that if Hitler lived today “his score for schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder was actually higher than 99% of the individuals in the Danish population.” It is also rare to have a high polygenic risk score for all three conditions, she added.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not diagnostic, and I also want to stress that the score absolutely by no means leads to any certain kinds of behavior or actions,” Demontis said.\n \n\n   \n  King agreed. “We are at great, great pain not to stigmatize people with these conditions, because, you know … it’s incredibly rare that   people with these conditions go on to commit violent acts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And the other thing is that Hitler did not act alone, he had hundreds and thousands of people who helped him,” King noted. “They’re not all going to have the same genetic makeup as him. His genetics is just a small, small puzzle piece.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/supreme-court-brown-v-board-race-affirmative-action-voting-rights-education","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Examining Brown v.

Board of Education, particularly under Chief Justice John Roberts and a conservative majority, which has led to a strict colorblind standard that undermines race-conscious remedies in education and voting.

Civil rights advocates, including Sherrilyn Ifill and Jon Greenbaum, argue that this trend 'hollows out' Brown’s legacy, ignoring structural racism and the ongoing need for remedial policies. The article also highlights a pending challenge to the Voting Rights Act, questioning whether private groups can sue when redistricting dilutes minority voting power, and warns that the Court’s shift toward colorblindness may erode decades of civil rights progress.

Board, race and ‘equal protection’ through the eyes of the modern Supreme Court \n       \n  By Joan Biskupic, CNN Chief Supreme Court Analyst\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Supreme Court heard arguments in a racially charged  Louisiana voting rights case  last month, down on its ground floor a special exhibit was running a continual loop of commentary from Chief Justice John Roberts and others extolling the desegregation ruling of Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit takes advantage of the  restored bench  used by US district court Judge Ronald Davies, who ordered the enrollment of nine Black students at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Three years after the Brown ruling, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus was still fighting school integration.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s  Cooper v. Aaron  decision, arising from that Arkansas standoff, declared the state bound by Brown and reinforced the mandate of desegregation.\n \n\n   \n  The tone of the justices’ commentary in a video is lofty, such as from Justice Brett Kavanaugh: “Brown v. Board of Education is the single greatest moment, single greatest decision, in this court’s history. And the reason for that is that it enforced a constitutional principle, ‘equal protection of the laws,’ ‘equal justice under law,’ and made that real for all Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the concept of “equal protection of the laws” has shrunk with the modern Supreme Court. That has been evident in the justices’ rulings on race-based measures in education. And  during oral arguments  in the Louisiana case, Kavanaugh was among the justices who suggested the era of racial remedies, in education and voting, must end.\n \n\n   \n  As race endures as a flashpoint for the justices, the court has weakened the spirit and reach of Brown. A series of impending cases may further erode civil rights milestones.\n \n\n   \n  “Brown is a shell now,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, former president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the organization that took the lead in Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  “They will never reverse it,” she said of the justices. “They will just hollow it out. It’s a much more cynical project than rejecting it outright. … It is still incumbent upon this court to reconcile the decisions they’re making today with the truth of that decision.”\n \n\n   \n   Brown’s legacy , say civil rights advocates, permits race to be used in remedial policies to ensure equal opportunity and to enhance diversity. They contend Brown never required governments to be blind to race, especially as prejudice and discrimination endure.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative majority that controls today’s court has been advancing a “colorblind” ideal and rejecting the kind of race-conscious remedies upheld for decades to address historic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts, Kavanaugh and others on the right-wing envision a country now in an era of racial neutrality, or as the  chief justice famously wrote in 2007 , “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  New cases are on the horizon as activists continue to take advantage of the court’s trend. The group that challenged Harvard and won a 2023 decision striking down race-based college admissions has filed a series of new lawsuits in lower courts, including one challenging the practice of Kamehameha Schools in Hawaii of giving a preference to applicants of Native Hawaiian ancestry.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the pending Louisiana dispute that began with a NAACP Legal Defense Fund claim of vote dilution in redistricting, the justices are scheduled this month to consider appeals that would test whether advocacy groups and other private parties can even bring such Voting Rights Act claims.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  accelerated  a separate line of litigation with its effort to end what’s known as “disparate impact” liability. Such lawsuits have traditionally been brought when an employer imposes a seemingly neutral policy that disproportionately hurts Blacks and other groups protected by civil rights law.\n \n\n   \n  A gap exists between the court’s declarations of equality and the country’s reality, especially considering the Trump administration’s diminishment of civil rights laws that date to the 1960s and its desire to end diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “The justices have been equating equal protection to colorblindness, and in doing that they are ignoring a history of structural racism and the continuing effects that give Black people and other people of color less opportunity,” said Jon Greenbaum, who for more than a decade was chief counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and last year founded Justice Legal Strategies.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going through a period of time where we need greater protection from the court rather than reduced protection,” said Greenbaum, the co-counsel in lawsuits arising from President Donald Trump’s removal of certain officials from independent agencies, such as the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n \n\n   \n    Division over what Brown means\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s reinterpretation of the 1954 Brown v. Board landmark was underway long before Trump first came to office. With Chief Justice Roberts at the lead, the court has ruled against school integration plans and  race-based admissions .\n \n\n   \n  The nine justices came together to offer video commentary for their Brown v. Board of Education exhibit tucked in an alcove behind the oversized sculpture of Chief Justice John Marshall. But they are themselves riven over what Brown means.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2023  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard  decision ending university race-based admissions, Roberts wrote for a six-justice majority that Brown stands for the principle that “eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” even measures that help traditionally excluded Black and Hispanic students.\n \n\n   \n  The three liberal dissenters countered, “Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. … In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts’ limited view of Brown was first on full display in the 2007 dispute over school-integration plans. He relied on the landmark as he invalidated efforts to diversify public schools in Seattle and Louisville.\n \n\n   \n  “Before  Brown , schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,” Roberts wrote. “The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again—even for very different reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted Justice John Paul Stevens to declare in dissent, “There is a cruel irony in The Chief Justice’s reliance on our decision in  Brown  v.  Board of Education.  … The Chief Justice fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools. In this and other ways, The Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court’s most important decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to reject the Seattle and Kentucky school-integration plans in that 2007 controversy, separated himself from the Roberts’ view of Brown and his “all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor” to ensure equal opportunity in schools.\n \n\n   \n  Wrote Kennedy, who retired in 2018, succeeded by Kavanaugh: “The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion.”\n \n\n   \n    Voting Rights Act\n \n\n   \n  The Louisiana redistricting case heard in October arises as the court has been erasing the protections of another milestone of the country’s civil rights era: The 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the arguments, the conservative majority may further restrict remedies for maps that dilute the electoral power of Blacks and Hispanics, particularly in the South.\n \n\n   \n  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act only after the March 7, 1965, “Bloody Sunday” attack on civil rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama. State troopers and other police assaulted the marchers with tear gas, clubs and whips.\n \n\n   \n  The pending VRA case traces to 2022, when Louisiana legislators drew a congressional-district map in which Blacks had the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the six districts, despite the fact that Blacks make up about a third of the population in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A lower US district court ruled that the map diluted Blacks’ electoral power and likely violated the Voting Rights Act; it ordered the state to redraw the map with two Black-majority districts. After the new map was crafted with two districts, White voters sued. The question for the justices is whether that second district unconstitutionally divided people by race.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a new question in a pair of appeals to be reviewed in the justices’ private conference on November 21 turns on whether only the US Justice Department – not private groups – can sue under the VRA to challenge redistricting that dilutes the power of minority voters. The  8th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a case  brought by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippawa Indians that that the VRA lacks a provision for such private lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  If the high court were to adopt that approach, few suits to vindicate voting rights would likely be brought. The Justice Department under Trump has retrenched on voting rights litigation. Even administrations interested in broadly enforcing the VRA had limited litigation resources and relied on private advocacy groups.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It was like a ray of hope’\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit highlighting Brown and the bench used by Judge Davies, known as the “Cooper Bench,” is scheduled to remain at the Supreme Court until next summer. Then the artifacts will  return to a permanent exhibit  in Arkansas.\n \n\n   \n  In the current video, the justices touch on dramatic highpoints, including Davies’ bravery in the face of threats and violence, President Dwight Eisenhower’s order of the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock, and the leadership of lawyer Thurgood Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  Marshall, as lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, developed the strategy against the “separate but equal” doctrine. In 1967, he became the first Black Supreme Court justice.\n \n\n   \n  The only Black justices since Marshall are Thomas, who succeeded him in 1991, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, appointed in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  The views of Thomas and Jackson on racial remedies and the legacy of Brown are the opposite. They  fiercely clashed  in the SFFA v. Harvard case.\n \n\n   \n  In the exhibit film, they offer observations from personal experience. Jackson refers to her parents, who grew up in the era of segregation, and were able to see her become a Supreme Court  justice.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas recalls the reverence people showed to Brown v. Board in his youth: “They would say ‘Brown,’ as though they had the familiarity of a constitutional scholar. ‘Brown.’”\n \n\n   \n  “For people who were unlettered, for people who were living in that system,” Thomas also relates, “Brown was a godsend, because it said that what was happening that we thought was wrong, they now know that this court said it was also wrong. It’s wrong, not just morally, but under the Constitution of the United States. It was like a ray of hope.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/charlotte-gregory-bovino-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-20:53","title":"Gregory Bovino and CBP Headed to Charlotte, North Carolina: Local Officials Caught Off Guard Amid Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top U.S. Customs and Border Protection official under the Trump administration, is reportedly leading a federal immigration enforcement operation to Charlotte, North Carolina, with agents arriving as early as the weekend of November 13, 2025.

headed next to Charlotte, North Carolina. That was news to city officials \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcolm Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers  to head to Charlotte , then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  “As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden – who initially was unaware of the operation – has been “contacted by two separate federal oﬃcials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week,” the sheriff’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office said details on the federal operation have not been shared with them and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The plans have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are not involved in planning federal operations, nor have they been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in federal immigration operations and would only get involved when there are warrants or criminal behavior under its jurisdiction, so “people who need local law enforcement services should feel secure calling 911,” said Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We still don’t know any details on where they may be operating and to what extent,” Lyles  said  Thursday. “I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Lyles asked residents to refrain from sharing unverified information about enforcement activities, which create “more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the federal government has not confirmed Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year, have created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials are in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out to the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting a Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/asia/south-korea-exam-flights-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00Z","title":"South Korea Bans Flights as 500,000 Take Crucial University Admission Test","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea suspended all flights at major airports, including Incheon, for 35 minutes during a crucial university entrance exam, to ensure students could focus on the listening comprehension section of the English test.

\n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:44 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the summer of 2024, a previously healthy 47-year-old father collapsed and died in the bathroom of his New Jersey home. An autopsy provided no answers. Everything looked normal, and his death was ruled sudden and unexplained.\n \n\n   \n  His widow reached out to a friend, a pediatrician. Would she read the autopsy report?\n \n\n   \n  The pediatrician, Dr. Erin McFeely, acted on a hunch and contacted Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia who had discovered almost two decades earlier that tick bites could cause people to develop an allergy to red meat.\n \n\n   \n  The allergy is unusual because the reaction doesn’t happen right away. People start to feel sick hours after they unwittingly eat beef, pork or lamb. Often, they’ll wake up in the middle of the night with symptoms that seem more like a bad bout of food poisoning or stomach flu than an allergy.\n \n\n   \n  Because so many people have potentially been sensitized to meat after tick bites but don’t know it, Platts-Mills and others have wondered whether there were unexplained deaths that were really severe reactions to a sugar found on mammalian cells, including those in red meat, called alpha-gal.\n \n\n   \n   The man’s case , which was detailed Wednesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice, turned out to be exactly what Platts-Mills had feared and is believed to be the first documented death linked to a red meat allergy.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time I’ve heard a story that I thought we could sort out,” said Platts-Mills, who is part scientist and part Sherlock Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  “We need the serum” – the clear part of the patient’s blood – which was taken during his autopsy. He asked McFeely, “Can we get it?”\n \n\n   \n    Tick bites turn deadly\n \n\n   \n  The man’s story started with chigger bites, the case study says. But they weren’t chiggers; they were baby lone star ticks, about the size and color of a grain of sand.\n \n\n   \n  The man had been bitten by dozens of these tiny seed ticks on a camping trip with his family.\n \n\n   \n  “And this tick, the mothers, lay 5,000 eggs at a time, and the larvae will bite you,” Platts-Mills told CNN . \n \n\n   \n  In many parts of the eastern United States, the deer population has reached unsustainable numbers. Deer are the main hosts of the lone star tick, and as deer populations have grown, tick populations have exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “That combination of so many deer and so many mothers and the larvae biting means that vast numbers of people are sensitized, of whom a minority get food-related symptoms and then are at risk of severe events,” Platts-Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Alpha-gal allergy is a reportable diagnosis in only three states – Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia – so the actual number of cases in the US is not known. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates  that as many as 450,000 Americans may have the allergy, but Platts-Mills estimates that as much as 5% of the population may be sensitized to red meat because of tick bites and not know it.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are not severe and can be managed by avoiding exposure to the sugar, which is found in food as well as in some pharmaceutical products. Symptoms range in severity from itchy hives or a rash to nausea and vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the lips or face, dizziness or fainting, and severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnose the condition by taking a careful history and controlled testing for a reaction to the sugar.\n \n\n   \n  Sometime after the camping trip, the case study says, the man’s family ate a late steak dinner. He woke at 2 a.m. with intense stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. He was in rough shape, but after two hours, his symptoms subsided.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, he told one of his sons, “I thought I was going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  His wife said they considered going to a doctor, but since the symptoms had eased, they didn’t know what they would say.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that a doctor’s visit would have helped. Too often, doctors don’t recognize alpha-gal allergy.  A 2023 CDC survey  found that 42% didn’t know what it was, and 35% said they lacked confidence to diagnose or manage it.\n \n\n   \n    An unrecognized allergy\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks later, in September 2024, the man and his wife went to a cookout, where he had a hamburger about 3 p.m. He drank a beer and came home and mowed the lawn. But by 7:20 p.m., he was vomiting again. His son called his mother and told her, “Dad is getting sick again.”\n \n\n   \n  A few minutes later, the son found his father unconscious on the bathroom floor. He couldn’t be revived.\n \n\n   \n  Platts-Mills says that when he   was back in his lab, having gone through the necessary layers of permission to get the man’s postmortem blood samples, he cursed himself for not driving up to New Jersey to collect them himself.\n \n\n   \n  The delivery company lost track of them briefly, he said. He imagined them sitting for hours in the back of a hot truck, the valuable information they contained being baked away.\n \n\n   \n  They finally arrived in his lab in April, and he tested them for levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies, Y-shaped proteins primed to latch onto allergens like ragweed and pollen. The man had antibodies to both alpha-gal sugars and red meat.\n \n\n   \n  Next, Platts-Mills sent some of the blood to the Mayo Clinic lab, which tested it for an enzyme called tryptase that’s made by immune cells called mast cells. Tryptase breaks down proteins and is a marker of allergic reactions.\n \n\n   \n  The man’s tryptase levels were over 2,000 nanograms per milliliter, among the highest values ever recorded in cases of fatal allergic reactions called anaphylaxis.\n \n\n   \n  The man had died of eating red meat – the first known food allergy fatality linked to alpha-gal syndrome.\n \n\n   \n  Other people  have died of reactions to alpha-gal sugars , but those cases have involved sugars attached to a chemotherapy drug called cetuximab, which was how the syndrome was discovered in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “We gave them closure,” Platts-Mills said of the family in the case study.   “People make a big fuss about closure, but you don’t get it until you see it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/military-venezuela-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:39:00-05:00","title":"Trump Briefed This Week on Options for Military Operations in Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has been briefed on a range of military options for operations in Venezuela, including air strikes on government and drug trafficking facilities, as part of a broader strategy under Operation Southern Spear.

The president has previously voiced reservations about taking military action meant to oust Nicolas Maduro, concerned about whether it would prove effective.\n \n\n   \n  While Wednesday’s briefing included an updated set of options for the president to consider, it did not indicate that he’s closer to making a decision, one of the people said. Another source familiar with the briefing said the options were similar to those that have been discussed within the Pentagon, and some publicly reported, in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The target options – which United States Southern Command has stood up planning cells to develop – are part of an operation dubbed “SOUTHERN SPEAR,” according to a senior US official aware of the planning. They were presented by top officials on Trump’s national security team, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the operation on X Thursday night, though he did not reveal details.\n \n\n   \n  “Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Command had  previously announced  an operation called Operation Southern Spear in January. An announcement at the time said it would utilize “long-dwell robotic surface vessels, small robotic interceptor boats, and vertical take-off and landing robotic air vessels” to help with counternarcotics operations.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Southern Spear. The White House did not comment on the briefing.\n \n\n   \n   The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” arrived in the Caribbean this week amid a massive scale-up of US military resources.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including  air strikes  on military or government facilities and drug trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN had  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action at all. Administration officials told lawmakers last week that the US  didn’t have a legal justification  that would support attacks against any land targets – though it is possible they could generate one. And Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/paul-ingrassia-general-services-administration-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:13:00-05:00","title":"Ingrassia Serving in New Role in Trump Administration After Withdrawing Nomination for Whistleblower Office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, a former White House liaison nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his nomination amid allegations of racist text messages, including offensive remarks about Martin Luther King Jr. Day and ethnic communities.

In a subsequent statement to Politico, he said, “there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs,” and that “we do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of Ingrassia’s withdrawal came from his own Truth Social account, as pressure against him mounted.

Martin Luther King Jr., is under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), the Rainbow PUSH Coalition said Wednesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “He has been managing this neurodegenerative condition for more than a decade,” the organization said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “He was originally diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease ;  however, last April ,  his PSP condition was confirmed. The family appreciates all prayers at this time.”\n \n\n   \n   Further details about his condition have not been released. However, there has been “significant improvement” in the civil rights leader’s condition over the last 24 hours under medical care, his son Jesse Jackson Jr. said Thursday in a segment during his weekday radio show.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of the Jackson family, we cannot extend enough of our gratitude for those of you who have expressed your thoughts and prayers,” he said on his KBLA show, “The Jesse Jackson Jr. Show.”\n \n\n   \n  PSP is “a rare neurological disorder that affects body movements, walking and balance, and eye movements,” according to the  US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .\n \n\n   \n  The disease typically begins in a person’s 60s and has some symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease, it adds. Most people with PSP develop severe disability within three to five years.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s son said he started receiving text messages from his mother towards the end of his radio show on Wednesday, sharing that his father “was not having a good day.” By the time he got to him, his father was already in the ambulance, with police and the fire department at the scene, Jackson Jr. said on his show.\n \n\n   \n  “I jumped out of my car and jumped into the ambulance and rode to the hospital,” Jackson Jr. said. “The doctors were able to work on him to get him the necessary fluids he needs to sustain him.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson rose to national prominence in the 1960s and has spent more than six decades advocating for racial equality, economic justice and voter rights.\n \n\n   \n  In 1971, he founded Operation PUSH as a way to improve Black communities’ economic conditions across the US.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson  later launched  the National Rainbow Coalition, in 1984, with the goal of obtaining equal rights for all Americans, according to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Some 12 years later, the two organizations merged to form Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  The organization’s origins stemmed from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s Operation Breadbasket, founded by King,  according to the website .\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s health drew public attention in 2017 when he spoke openly about his  diagnosis of Parkinson’s , an incurable disease characterized by tremors, stiffness and impaired movement.\n \n\n   \n  “My family and I began to notice changes about three years ago,” Jackson wrote in a statement at the time, calling the recognition of the symptoms “painful,” and noting Parkinson’s was the disease “that bested my father.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he took   the diagnosis as “a signal that I must make lifestyle changes and dedicate myself to physical therapy in hopes of slowing the disease’s progression.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Jackson faced several health challenges, including gallbladder surgery and Covid-19 hospitalization with his wife. Later that year, he suffered a fall and hit his head while attending a meeting at Howard University in Washington, DC, and was kept in the hospital overnight for observation.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2023, Jackson announced his retirement as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, succeeded by Rev. Frederick Douglass Haynes III.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-mvp-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:25:00-05:00","title":"Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani unanimously voted MVP for fourth time; Yankees’ Aaron Judge named AL’s back-to-back winner","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers is named the National League’s Most Valuable Player for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in MLB history to win the MVP award twice in both leagues.

securing his reputation as a generational talent.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese pitcher-slugger was again unanimously voted the National League’s Most Valuable Player on Thursday, the second year in a row he has been named the league’s best player. New York Yankees right fielder  Aaron Judge  took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani, sitting next to his wife,  Mamiko Tanaka , and their dog,  Decoy , when his name was announced on MLB Network, gave a lil smooch to his pup to celebrate the occasion.\n \n\n   \n  The 31-year-old is now the first player in Major League Baseball history to win the award twice in both leagues. The five-time All-Star was named the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels before leaving for the cross-town Dodgers after signing a reported  $700 million  contract.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight  World Series  win.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese star hit 55 home runs, 102 RBI with a .282 batting average this season, highlighted by a  magical postseason run  that saw him hit three home runs on the way to the Fall Classic victory.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to  pitching  in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.\n \n\n   \n  The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a  historic season  last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all  30 votes  to win unanimously.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That’s first and foremost, it’s icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”\n \n\n   \n  He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB’s all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.\n \n\n   \n  Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.\n \n\n   \n  Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he’s won.\n \n\n   \n  “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today’s game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”\n \n\n   \n  Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher  Cal Raleigh  and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with  17  first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn’t beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”\n \n\n   \n  With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates’ 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year.

to bait Kim Jong Un with drones \n       \n  By Yoonjung Seo, Brad Lendon, Mike Valerio, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:40 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Secret drone flights from South Korea to the heart of Pyongyang were part of a ploy by the former president to rattle the North Korean leader, South Korean prosecutors have alleged as they released new details of plot they say preceded a foiled attempt to  declare martial law. \n \n\n   \n  Memos found on a senior defense official’s phone purportedly reveal plans by former president Yoon Suk Yeol and two other senior defense officials to aggravate Kim Jong Un enough to justify a shocking late-night military control order issued last December.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the evidence on Monday, appearing to confirm North Korea’s claims that South Korea sent covert drones to the country to drop anti-regime leaflets last October. The flights prompted a rare and fiery statement from Kim Yo Jong, Kim’s powerful sister.\n \n\n   \n  The North vowed to sever all road and rail connections to the South,  blowing up two roads  within its territory, but stopping short of military action. Weeks later, Yoon declared martial law, citing the need to protect the liberal South from “North Korean communist forces.”\n \n\n   \n  The snap decree was lifted within hours when South Korean lawmakers pushed past troops to vote it down, the first step in a reckoning for Yoon that’s still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n   A new indictment Monday  adds to Yoon’s mounting legal battles, which include a trial underway for alleged insurrection, and provides more pieces to a political puzzle that’s yet to be fully explained.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon denies he ordered drones to fly to Pyongyang to provoke North Korea and that he attempted to stage an insurrection through martial law.\n \n\n   \n  Yoo Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon’s lawyers, called the indictment “a one-sided prosecution” that “fails to uphold even the basic tenets of legal logic, beyond being absurd.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the spokesperson and a prosecutor for the counsel, Park Ji-young, said prosecutors were “appalled” at what they had uncovered – and on Monday they released memos they say support their claim.\n \n\n   \n    Drones buzzing Kim’s home\n \n\n   \n  The allegations date back to last October, when North Korean state media reported that South Korean drones had  violated Pyongyang’s airspace  on multiple occasions, dropping anti‑regime leaflets.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released photos showing one drone lodged in a tree, described by analysts as resembling a South Korean military unmanned aerial vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  KCNA also showed images of a drone it said was spotted flying low in the skies above the home of North’s Korean authoritarian supreme leader.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Byung-joo, a retired Korean Army four-star general now a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic Party, which sits in opposition to Yoon’s former party, told CNN in July that he had received details of the drone flights directly from whistleblowers of South Korea’s Drone Operations Command.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kim, the flights took place on at least three occasions, October 3, October 8-9, and November 13 of last year.\n \n\n   \n  “It is believed that by sending drones into the heart of North Korea and dropping leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un, the aim was to provoke a military response from the North,” the South Korean lawmaker told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like holding a knife to (North Korea’s) neck,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Kim Yo Jong issued her statement on October 12, condemning the airspace incursions and warning of “severe consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Kim Yong-hyun, then South Korea’s defense minister, initially denied sending drones to North Korea, but soon changed his response to say he “could not confirm” North Korea’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  After Yoon’s disastrous attempt to impose martial law, lawmakers from the now ruling Democratic Party demanded an inquiry into allegations the former president conspired to spark a national security crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Once in power, the lawmakers passed a bill to appoint an independent counsel, who released memos on Monday that they say reveal evidence of covert discussions about Yoon’s plans to provoke North Korea, a country with a long history of bombastic threats against South Korea and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  Among notes found on a phone belonging to the former Defense Counterintelligence Commander Yeo In-hyung were references to creating an “unstable situation,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Must find and exploit a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that can produce short-term effects. To do that, we must create an unstable situation or seize an opportunity that has been created,” read one note drafted October 18 last year, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Another note read: “Targeting where (North Korea) loses face to such an extent that they feel they have no option but to respond.” Locations listed included the capital, two nuclear facilities, Kim’s vacation homes, as well as Samjiyon and Wonsan.\n \n\n   \n  Samjiyon is regarded as a sacred site in North Korea for being the birthplace of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, and a symbolic location tied to his grandfather’s anti-Japanese resistance.\n \n\n   \n  The Wonsan-Kalma tourist area is one of Kim Jong Un’s flagship development projects, that has been hailed as a “great success” by the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Another memo from October 23 stated, “Goal and final status,” containing phrases such as “At minimum-national security crisis” and “At maximum-Noah’s flood,” in a possible reference to Noah’s Ark, where the only survivors of a biblical flood were those on board a mighty ship.\n \n\n   \n  A later note dated November 5 stated, “Enemy action must come first. There must be a wartime situation or a situation that cannot be controlled by police forces. Create the enemy’s conditions… we must wait for the decisive opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Park, the prosecutor’s spokesperson, said further details could not be disclosed due to laws concerning military secrets.\n \n\n   \n  However, she added that evidence from a notebook belonging to former Defense Intelligence Commander Noh Sang-won suggested that discussions and preparations for the martial law were believed to have begun no later than October 2023, after a major reshuffle of South Korea’s military generals.\n \n\n   \n  “The (alleged) act of the President, who holds supreme command over national security, and the defense minister, attempting to use inter-Korean military tensions to create conditions for declaring martial law, is absolutely unacceptable,” said Park.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmaker Kim Byung-joo, the retired general, said he was surprised the North Korean leader did not order a response after alleged South Korean drones were spotted over the capital.\n \n\n   \n  “In hindsight, it was a godsend luck for South Korea that North Korea refrained from any military provocation and stopped at rhetorical threats,” he said. “Had North Korea chosen to respond with military action under those circumstances, it could have escalated into a localized conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s deployment of more than 10,000 troops to Russia as combat soldiers in the war against Ukraine may have dissuaded Kim from acting further, said Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “North Korea could have found it difficult to maintain two war fronts, at the time. Because it would have meant causing a significant gap in combat capability.”\n \n\n   \n    A frustrated leader’s shocking act\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, and his former defense officials Kim and Yeo, all face charges of harming the interest of the state by helping the enemy and abusing their power. The three are already on trial on insurrection charges relating to the  martial law declaration. \n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military has yet to comment on the investigation or the indictment, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.  CNN has reached out to lawyers for Kim and Yeo. According to local media, Yeo has said he deeply regrets not challenging Yoon’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, a firebrand conservative who has long taken a hardline on North Korea, narrowly won election in 2022, but his ruling party never had a majority in parliament, and struggled to get its legislative agenda passed. It was a source of constant frustration for his administration, and towards the end of last year, that frustration exploded in spectacular fashion.\n \n\n   \n  On December 3, Yoon declared martial law in a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within the opposition parties in the government that were sympathetic to North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopters and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television.\n \n\n   \n  Though assembly members pushed through the soldiers and voted to overturn the martial law decree, Yoon’s actions triggered mass protests, legal challenges, and ultimately, his removal through impeachment.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say sending drone flights into North Korea could have been interpreted as an act of war, provoking a military response that could have escalated into war.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Peninsula has been divided ever since a brutal war between the North and South ended with an armistice agreement in 1953. But the hostilities have never officially ended and relations between the two neighbors have been precarious ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said if Yoon had ordered the drone flights, it “would represent a dangerous interaction of domestic politics and security policy” in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  “While some national security activities are necessarily clandestine and operate in legal gray areas, robust checks, balances, and policy vetting should ensure they serve national interests rather than personal agendas,” Easley said.\n \n\n   \n  Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the potential international ramifications of the case are considerable, especially for the United States, a South Korean treaty ally with tens of thousands of troops at bases on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Drone flights into North Korea, he added, would violate the armistice agreement between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that the North Koreans violate the armistice all the time, but they’re not held politically accountable for it at home,” he said. “In a democracy like South Korea you can be held politically accountable for that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/uk/sami-hamdi-uk-us-ice-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:42:00Z","title":"British Journalist Says ICE Detention Was ‘Attack on Freedoms’ After 18-Day Ordeal in US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British journalist Sami Hamdi, a political commentator known for his criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza and advocacy for Palestinian rights, was detained by US immigration officials at San Francisco International Airport after attending a CAIR event.

US \n       \n  By Kara Fox, Sana Noor Haq, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:42 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A British journalist and political commentator  detained  by US immigration officers for more than two weeks warned of “an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide” as he returned to the UK Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained  Sami Hamdi , a London-based father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport. ICE stopped him the day after he addressed the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) California’s annual gala, while he was en route to Florida to speak at a similar event.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. However, Hamdi and his legal team said he was in the US on a valid visa and was detained for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza as “political retaliation.”   \n \n\n   \n  Hamdi recounted his 18 day ordeal to CNN shortly after his return to London.\n \n\n   \n  “When I entered San Francisco airport to fly to Florida, I went through security. As I looked for my gate, D38 to Tampa, a man walked up to me and said… ‘your visa was revoked two days ago, so now you are here illegally.’”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said the news came as a surprise, and he told the officials who had approached him that he had not been informed his visa was under review. He said he was then presented with a memo from the US State Department that said his visa had been revoked, without a reason as to why.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about any evidence that would show that Hamdi had overstayed his visa on Thursday, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told CNN that he wasn’t able to speak on specific cases but said: “We’re going to enforce our immigration laws…We’re revoking visas when appropriate, in line with our national security.”   \n \n\n   \n  At the airport, Hamdi said he asked officers for an explanation for the revocation, saying that if there wasn’t one, he would just “book my ticket to London and fly home.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the officers then told him: “‘That’s not the way this works here,’” before escorting him out of the terminal to a vehicle that was waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said he was told to get in the car, but initially refused, telling the officers: “With the greatest of respect, this looks like the movies. I’m not getting in any black car. I’m a British citizen. I have rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his appearances on British TV, his analyses on Middle East developments, for his support of the Palestinian cause – and his criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After advocating for a phone call, Hamdi, said he briefly spoke with CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties organization, before he was taken to an ICE facility over four hours away.\n \n\n   \n  “They loaded me into a van with tight cuffs on my feet and on my hands, and they drove me four hours…and a half… I had to do a swap in the middle with a different car. And then they took me to the middle of nowhere,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At the detention center, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions, alongside nearly 100 people in an overcrowded room.\n \n\n   \n  Despite never being charged with a crime, Hamdi said he was kept in shackles in for-profit facilities with little oversight.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality is that those those facilities are dehumanizing to the human beings (there), and when you look at the stories of the other inmates, it only breaks your heart,” he said, recounting multiple stories of fathers with green cards who had been detained without charge.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not that the courts won’t find them innocent, it’s that it seems there’s a concerted effort to make sure they do not go in front of a judge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s query on Hamdi’s claims about his time in ICE detention Thursday but Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reiterated an earlier statement that said: “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to say that this wasn’t just an attack on me. It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide. It was an attack on their freedom to speak the truth in the face of hatred,” Hamdi said shortly after he returned back to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi first came under fire after speaking at an event in London in 2023 following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. There, he told his audience not to pity Palestinians but rather to “celebrate the victory,”    in remarks from a speech that he told CNN were taken out of context.\n \n\n   \n  In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “My argument was that we have to solve the issue of the rights of the Palestinians. We have to solve the issue of occupation, apartheid, and that will bring peace to the region,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the reason that my visa was targeted was not because of anything that I was saying but it was because Americans were listening,” he said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Public opinion is shifting because people are seeing the truth,” he added, alluding to growing awareness of suffering in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has firmly denied accusations of genocide.\n \n\n   \n  Laura Loomer, a conservative American activist with a direct line to Trump, said in late October that Hamdi’s detention had come after she had applied “relentless pressure” on the State Department and DHS. She accused Hamdi of being a supporter of Hamas. CAIR has accused Loomer of being an “anti-Muslim extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said his “detention was a stark demonstration that a Muslim journalist can be held captive because extremists, amplified on social media, seek to weaponize state policy against inconvenient speech.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights organizations have criticized the actions of the Trump administration, saying that they violate free speech protections, which apply to anyone who is legally in the US, regardless of citizenship status.\n \n\n   \n  Hussam Ayloush, CAIR California CEO, said in a Thursday statement Hamdi’s detention should “alarm anyone who cares about the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  While Hamdi said he is mulling whether to sue US authorities, he also said he would rather take what he considers a win, and instead “celebrate” the decisions of the “cool heads” in the US State Department and federal court system.\n \n\n   \n  “I won this case, the extremists failed to silence my voice, they failed to remove my freedom of speech. America stood with me,” he said, adding that he was looking forward to spending time with his family and a game of soccer over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  While he said he is grateful for the global attention brought to his case, he also implied that he is keen to exit the limelight.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not the story,” he added. “The story is one of the most heinous genocides of our time. The story is about kids who had their heads blown off. The story is about kids who had their legs blown off. The story is about innocent women and children who were bombed into oblivion for crimes they did not commit,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/michigan-business-jet-ntsb","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00Z","title":"Business jet that crashed in Michigan was flown after pilots chose not to wait for a test pilot, NTSB says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Mexican-registered Raytheon Hawker 800XP business jet crashed in Bath Township, Michigan, on October 16, 2025, killing all three people on board.

plane crashed in Bath Township, Michigan on  October 16,  killing the three people onboard.\n \n\n   \n  Before the crash, the plane had been parked in Battle Creek, Michigan, for maintenance for seven months, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  The work included removing part of the wing, which requires pilots to test fly it in an aerodynamic stall— a maneuver in which the plane loses lift — before it could be returned to service.\n \n\n   \n  When the crew arrived to pick up the plane, the company that did the maintenance work, Duncan Aviation,  suggested they hire a test pilot to perform the stall test, the report noted.\n \n\n   \n  “The captain was provided with a list of experienced test pilots, for hire, to perform the post-maintenance stall test flight,” the NTSB said in the report. “However, after being unable to coordinate the stall test flight with a test pilot, the flight crew elected to perform the post-maintenance stall test themselves.”\n \n\n   \n  Publicly

His body was then taken to Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  During the attack, Godard and his wife hid in the safe room of their home in Be’eri Kibbutz. They later fled after their house was set on fire, and the attackers “ambushed them outside,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Thursday. After the father of four was killed, “Ayelet hid in the bushes for several hours before she was also murdered,” the forum added.\n \n\n   \n  Godard spent his childhood on Israeli beaches alongside his father, who was a lifeguard, the forum said. Later, Godard also became a lifeguard, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s National Center of Forensic Medicine confirmed his identity after his remains were released by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross and then turned over to Israeli authorities. The handover leaves three remaining deceased hostages in the Gaza Strip.\n \n\n   \n  Israel is “determined, committed and tirelessly working to bring back all of our fallen hostages for a proper burial in their homeland,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement announcing the identification of Godard.\n \n\n   \n  In a transfer that was part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement, Israel earlier said it received a coffin containing the remains via the Red Cross in Gaza and transported them to Israel’s national forensics laboratory for identification. Hamas did not identify which of the last few deceased hostages it was handing over.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ military wing said earlier Thursday that it would hand over the body of an Israeli found near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  This release of remains comes after a series of such transfers last week, including that of the longest-held deceased hostage in Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas handed over the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the final days of a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas. The transfer of Goldin’s remains was the fifth such occurrence in little more than a week, bringing Hamas down to the final few deceased hostages still in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize  rallies  in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Eitan Horn, who was  recently freed  after 738 days in captivity, said in Hostages Square last weekend: “I cannot begin my journey of healing and recovery as long as I know there are families who are not with me on this journey.

president to discuss some race and gender topics. The changes come months after a viral video of a student confronting an instructor over her lessons threw the campus into upheaval.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy will apply to all 12 schools within the system, including at Texas A&M, the flagship campus that is one of the largest universities in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy states that no academic course “will advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” unless approved in advance by a campus president.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy appears to be the first time that a public university system in Texas has put in rules on what faculty can talk about in their classroom on the topics of race and gender.\n \n\n   \n  Other university systems in Texas have also placed restrictions on classroom instruction or have begun internal reviews of course offerings following a new state law.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the new policy say it would impede the ability of faculty to teach, undermine academic freedom and could be a violation of First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  “It really strikes at the heart of what education means and what universities do, which is circulate the exchange of knowledge without fear of retaliation, without fear censorship,” Rana Jaleel, chair of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom, said about the A&M system’s new policy.\n \n\n   \n  Various universities and their presidents around the country, including  Harvard ,  Columbia , and the  University of Virginia , have come under increased scrutiny this year from conservative critics and the administration of President Donald Trump over  diversity, equity and inclusion practices  and the schools’ responses to  campus protests. \n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Trump asked nine major universities , including the University of Texas at Austin, to agree to various provisions, including commitments to eliminate race and sex from admissions decisions, to accept the government’s strict binary definition of “man” and “woman” and to promote conservative views on campus.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy defines “race ideology” as a “concept that attempts to shame a particular race or ethnicity, accuse them of being oppressors in a racial hierarchy or conspiracy” or assigns “them intrinsic guilt based on the actions of their presumed ancestors or relatives.” The policy defines “gender ideology” as a “concept of self-assessed gender identity replacing and disconnected from the biological category of sex.”\n \n\n   \n  “The goal is transparent and document cocurricular review, not policing individual speech,” James Hallmark, vice chancellor for the Texas A&M University System’s Office of Academic Affairs, told the regents.\n \n\n   \n  In approving the policy, regents did not refer to September’s  firing of Melissa McCoul , a senior lecturer in the English department at Texas A&M University, after video was made public in which she argued with a female student over gender identity being taught in a children’s literature class. McCoul’s firing came after political pressure from Republican lawmakers, including Gov.  Greg Abbott .\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after McCoul’s termination, Texas A&M’s then president,  Mark A. Welsh III, resigned.  He did not offer a reason for stepping down but he and the school had faced political pressure and criticism, including from Abbott, after the video was posted on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Bright, president of the American Association of University Professors A&M chapter, said he believes McCoul’s case opened the door for the university system to put this policy in place.\n \n\n   \n  “Our job is to teach facts, teach the truth, and if … we have to use a litmus test of whether or not it meets someone’s approval, and it could be quite frankly their political approval, then we have no truth,” Bright, who is a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, told the AP ahead of the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  During Thursday’s meeting, eight Texas A&M professors and instructors, including Bright, spoke against the policy, with many calling on regents to rehire McCoul.\n \n\n   \n  Two A&M professors spoke in favor of the policy, including Adam Kolasinski, with the Department of Finance, who said he didn’t believe the policy violated academic freedom and that “academic freedom does not mean you get to teach whatever you want.”\n \n\n   \n  Regent Sam Torn said the policy was being put in place to “make sure we are educating, not advocating.”\n \n\n   \n  A Texas law that forbids Texas K-12 schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity took effect on Sept. 1.

\n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:37 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least half a dozen major media companies have stared down legal threats from President Trump this year. Some have chosen to fight, others have opted to fold. The BBC is signaling that it will fight.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the British national broadcaster responded to a  demand letter  from Trump’s lawyers by  apologizing for an editing error  but arguing that the president doesn’t have a serious case.\n \n\n   \n  The public response indicated that if Trump goes ahead and sues, the BBC will vigorously defend itself, rather than immediately seek to settle the matter out of court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a pivotal moment in the ongoing tug-of-war between Trump and the news outlets that strive to report on him independently and confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is a fight about stopping Trump from deploying his pattern of intimidation, bluster and threats against an organization that plays a huge role in setting the global media agenda,” Joel Simon, the founding director of the Journalism Protection Initiative, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Simon, who has been  chronicling  the BBC’s efforts to expand in the US, said the dustup is also “about the ability of the British public to determine what kind of media it wants, and what kind of BBC, without Trump mucking it up.”\n \n\n   \n  In the US this year, Trump has proven adept at applying political and legal pressure to media owners — and has squeezed settlement payments and other concessions out of some, but not all, of them.\n \n\n   \n  Media critics and consumers have worried that Trump’s attempts at intimidation and dominance have caused journalists to soften and self-censor aggressive reporting.\n \n\n   \n  But some newsroom leaders and media moguls have recognized that Trump’s tests are an opportunity to reaffirm their independence.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC seems to be doing that.\n \n\n   \n  As outgoing BBC director general Tim Davie said the other day, “We have to fight for our journalism.”\n \n\n   \n    No payout, no retreat\n \n\n   \n  Let’s be clear about what happened: Someone at the BBC’s “Panorama” newsmagazine program screwed up by stitching together two different clips from Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech hours ahead of the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  No one seemed to notice the error when the documentary first aired in October 2024. But when the editing error was publicized last week, the BBC was too slow to address the controversy, giving Trump even more of an opening to target the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness  resigned on Sunday , citing the need for leaders to take responsibility, even though the mistake was made much further down the editorial chain.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, BBC chair Samir Shah acknowledged an “error in judgment” with the clip. By then, Florida-based lawyers for Trump had sent the BBC a letter claiming the documentary caused Trump “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” and warning of a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts scoffed at the letter, saying Trump’s chances of winning such a lawsuit were low.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has pursued other legal claims in the past despite a similarly low likelihood of success. And some institutions have folded under the pressure.\n \n\n   \n   Disney , the parent of ABC, and  Paramount , the parent of CBS, decided to strike settlement deals with Trump rather than risk court battles. Both media companies made payments toward Trump’s future presidential library, triggering widespread outrage.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as the BBC said it received a legal threat from Trump, speculation arose about a similar payout by the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  But there has been no such settlement or secret side deal, a senior BBC source told CNN. And if such a payout were ever to occur, it would be publicly disclosed. The BBC, after all, is primarily funded through license fees paid by British taxpayers.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s own news coverage of Thursday’s legal reply to Trump emphasized that the broadcaster had “rejected his demands for compensation.”\n \n\n   \n  “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the broadcaster’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s lawyers had given the BBC a Friday deadline to respond. The president had no immediate reaction to the broadcaster’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    The pros and cons of standing tall\n \n\n   \n  News outlets that have stood up to Trump this year have garnered praise from readers. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, for instance, are both fighting suits that were filed on Trump’s behalf by the same Florida law firm.\n \n\n   \n  The suit against The Times was initially  thrown out  by a judge in September for being “decidedly improper and impermissible.”\n \n\n   \n  When the lawyers refiled a shorter version, The Times was forceful in its response. “As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: This lawsuit has no merit,” a newspaper spokesperson said. “This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate P.R. attention, but The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.”\n \n\n   \n  Media executives have pointed out, however, that court battles can be costly and unpredictable.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials may find themselves hoping that Trump gets distracted and moves on to a new target.\n \n\n   \n  When Disney briefly suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel amid pressure from the Trump administration in September, the consumer backlash was swift, including in the form of Disney+ subscriber cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  And when Disney brought Kimmel back on the air — showing a willingness to fight after briefly deciding to fold — Trump made one more blustery threat against ABC. But then he evidently moved on; the government hasn’t taken any known action against the network, and the president hasn’t brought up Kimmel in nearly two months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/fetterman-hospitalized-fall","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00-05:00","title":"Pennsylvania Sen.

      \n  By Stefano Pozzebon, Michael Rios, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:19 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The people of the United States should unite with Venezuela for the peace of the Americas, Venezuelan President  Nicolás Maduro  told CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon in the middle of a rally in Caracas on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  His exclusive remarks come amid heightened tensions with the US, which has  deployed warships  to the Caribbean to target what it claims are drug trafficking vessels from Venezuela. Though Washington insists the military buildup is aimed at disrupting the flow of narcotics to the United States, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro urged the US against entering another prolonged conflict, asking its people in Spanish: “To unite for the peace of (the Americas). No more endless wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan.”\n \n\n   \n   Asked if he had a message for US President Donald Trump, Maduro replied in English: “Yes peace, yes peace.”\n \n\n   \n  He did not directly answer whether he was concerned about possible aggression from the US. Instead, he simply replied that he was focused on governing his country with peace.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro was attending a mass rally for Venezuela’s youth, whom he later urged to resist what he described as a threat of invasion from the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past three months, the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the Caribbean alongside more than a dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform.”\n \n\n   \n  The build-up, considered the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989, has raised speculation that the US may be preparing for a larger conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US says it has carried out at least  20 strikes  against alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing 80 people.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that the Trump administration is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside the South American nation. But the administration has also told Congress in recent days that the US did not have a legal justification that would support strikes within Venezuela, though CNN has reported that officials are considering what such a legal opinion would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela has responded by launching a massive  mobilization  of military personnel as well as militia forces made up of civilians. The units have been carrying out exercises across the country to prepare for any potential threat from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The country also appears to have installed large objects on a key highway that are commonly used to block military vehicles such as tanks. A satellite image captured by Vantor on November 10 shows “hedgehog” anti-vehicle obstacles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, which is the main route into the city from the coast. The obstacles first appeared there over a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, has some 123,000 members. Maduro has also claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/americas/canada-ontario-bus-joyride-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:52:00Z","title":"Man takes bus for joyride in Canada, turns down passenger with expired pass","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, took a public transit bus for a joyride after the real driver took a break, driving it for about 15 minutes with around 10 passengers onboard.

that he took bribes to help gamblers win bets on his pitches.\n \n\n   \n  The 27-year-old reliever was released on $600,000 bond following his appearance in Brooklyn federal court. Clase also surrendered his passport and was ordered to limit his travel to New York and Ohio, refrain from gambling and submit to GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  The three-time All-Star and two-time American League Reliever of the Year was arrested and taken into custody earlier Thursday at John F. Kennedy Airport after arriving on a flight from his native Dominican Republic, according to the US attorney’s office.\n \n\n   \n  Clase, dressed in a dark blazer and jeans, didn’t speak in court other than to answer the judge’s “yes” or “no” questions through a Spanish interpreter. He didn’t comment to reporters after the proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s Guardians teammate,  Luis Ortiz , who was also implicated in the alleged scheme, pleaded not guilty Wednesday. Both are due back in court Dec. 2.\n \n\n   \n  The two pitchers have been on  non-disciplinary paid  leave since July, when MLB began investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched.\n \n\n   \n  According to prosecutors, the two accepted thousands of dollars in bribes to help two unnamed gamblers in their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on bets placed on the speed and outcome of their pitches.\n \n\n   \n  They allege that Clase, who is on the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract, began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023, but didn’t ask for payoffs until earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say Clase often threw the rigged pitches on the first pitch of an at-bat, making sure to throw the ball in the dirt and well outside the strike zone in order to assure the umpire called it a ball rather than a strike.\n \n\n   \n  During an April game against the Boston Red Sox, Clase even spoke to one of the betters by phone just before taking the mound, prosecutors contend. Minutes later, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph (157.63 kph).\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say Clase recruited Ortiz to join the scheme earlier this year and sometimes provided money to the gamblers to fund the bets.\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s lawyer, Michael Ferrara, noted in court Thursday that the Guardians’ all-time saves leader voluntarily returned to the US to answer to the charges rather than make prosecutors seek extradition.\n \n\n   \n  “His actions speak louder than words. He poses no risk of flight,” Ferrara said as the judge weighed the conditions of Clase’s release. “He intends to stay through this.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Ferrara said Clase maintains his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,” he said in a Wednesday statement.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Georgalis, a lawyer for Ortiz, has also denied the charges, saying payments between his client and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for legal activities.\n \n\n   \n  Clase and Ortiz are each charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Following the pitchers’ indictments, Major League Baseball announced new limits on betting on individual pitches.\n \n\n   \n  The charges against Clase and Ortiz are the latest gambling scandals to roil American professional sports following the landmark 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that legalized sports betting in most states.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, more than 30 people, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, were  arrested in a gambling sweep  that involved leaked inside information about NBA athletes and rigged poker games backed by Mafia families.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/epstein-files-house-vote-johnson","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00-05:00","title":"Johnson shifts strategy on Epstein files vote – as GOP leaders brace for mass defections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has shifted strategy and expedited a vote on a bipartisan bill introduced by Republican Rep.

strategy on Epstein files vote – as GOP leaders brace for mass defections \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Manu Raju, Kristen Holmes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:31 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson decided to  quickly schedule a House vote  on an effort to force the release of all of the Jeffrey Epstein case files once the calculation was made that it couldn’t be stopped.\n \n\n   \n  The decision marked a shift in strategy for Johnson and the White House, who had long sought  to delay the process , ​three sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from  President Donald Trump  and support the bipartisan bill led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna calling for the Justice Department to release the Epstein files — as supporters push for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  Republican sources say there’s a broad cross-section of the conference willing to support the plan — and it will be hard to limit defections.\n \n\n   \n  “No point in waiting,” one House GOP leadership source familiar with the strategy shift told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A House GOP lawmaker said of the speaker’s decision: “If you got to do it, might as well do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie told CNN on Wednesday that his hope is that a veto-proof majority will pressure the Senate to act over Trump’s opposition. It would require two-thirds of the House — or 290 votes if all members are present — for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get less than two-thirds vote when it comes up for a vote, I think it’s an uphill battle,” Massie said. “But if we are somehow able to get two thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president.”\n \n\n   \n  A Senior White House official told CNN that Trump was made aware ahead of time that Johnson was going to expedite the vote, and that the two had spoken about it.\n \n\n   \n  “It was made clear to President Trump, and he understands that this is an inevitable reality,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson sent the House of Representatives home for its August recess early – in part to avoid a  vote  related to the Epstein files. When the House returned in September, top congressional Republicans and White House allies were working  behind the scenes  to prevent the politically charged vote. And there was even a last-ditch effort by the president and his allies on Wednesday  to engage with  two of the Republican women helping the effort move forward before it was too late.\n \n\n   \n  But now, GOP sources told CNN, part of the calculation is that the momentum in the House is unstoppable and the only course of action is to send it over to the Senate to deal with.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it out of the House,” another GOP lawmaker in support of the strategy told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, Massie and Khanna were expecting it to be weeks before their bill would get a vote on the House floor.\n \n\n   \n  Even after the bipartisan duo secured the 218 signatures needed to move forward on Wednesday, there was still a procedural process that had to play out because the effort did not have the blessing of House Republican leadership to come to the floor sooner.\n \n\n   \n  So when Johnson said Wednesday that he was going to expedite the process and put the bill on the floor next week, many were surprised.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson  said  on Wednesday, adding, “In the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given the ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the panel on Wednesday and top Trump administration officials  met with  GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of the few Republicans who signed onto the effort demanding DOJ release its trove of Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t block the parade, you might as well get ahead of it,” Khanna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  If Massie and Khanna’s bill clears the House, as is now expected, it’s fate in the Senate remains uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00Z","title":"Tracking states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article details the unprecedented surge in politically motivated redistricting across the United States in 2025, driven by the need to influence the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections.

sues to stop California from redistricting to give Democrats more House seats \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration moved Thursday to challenge California’s effort to redraw the state’s  congressional maps  ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, throwing the full weight of the Justice Department in the high-stakes battle over control the House of Representatives next year.\n \n\n   \n  After voters in the Golden State approved a ballot measure last week that allows state Democratic lawmakers to replace congressional lines drawn by the state’s independent commission  with new ones  that make five Republican-held US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the California Republican Party and others raced to court to block the redistricting effort.\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s move to join that lawsuit is a dramatic escalation in the legal challenge, which, if successful, could scramble Democrats’ plan to push back against a nationwide effort by Republicans, at the behest of President Donald Trump, to boost the party’s chance of holding on to their House majority through rare, mid-decade redistricting ploys across several states.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the Trump administration told the federal judge overseeing the case in the Central District of California on Thursday that days after the case was brought last week, the “federal interest” in the matter became clear given the constitutional issues and claims of race-based discrimination at stake in the challenge.\n \n\n   \n  They argued that the redistricting plan was sold to voters as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  “Our Constitution does not tolerate this racial gerrymander,” the Justice Department lawyers  wrote in court papers . “Because the Proposition 50 map does, the United States respectfully requests that this court enjoin defendants from using it in the 2026 election and future elections.”\n \n\n   \n  “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,” said Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, cast California’s plan as a “brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process.”\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    64% of voters backed Newsom plan\n \n\n   \n  Democrats argued the measure, Proposition 50, was necessary to counter Texas’ new congressional map, which Republicans redrew in a bid to gain five seats at Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  While Texas Republicans were able to draw new lines with legislation, California Democrats needed voters to pass a constitutional amendment to temporarily override the state’s non-partisan independent redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  Over  64% of voters  approved the plan.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats significantly outraised and outspent Republicans in the state. Newsom became the face of the measure, arguing that Democrats needed to “fight fire with fire” to prevent the president from skewing the 2026 midterm election map. Other key surrogates, including former President Barack Obama, joined the effort, which Democrats see as key to their chances of retaking the House next year.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not usual for the federal government to get involved in election-related cases. During the Biden administration, the Justice Department had its hands in litigation over state efforts to purge voter rolls and certain restrictive voting measures enacted in GOP-led states.\n \n\n   \n  The California case hasn’t developed much since it was brought last week. Newsom and the other stare officials named as defendants have yet to file responses to the allegations and the judge randomly assigned to the case has not scheduled any major court hearings. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been allowed to join the case to defend the redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n    Trump has backed pro-GOP efforts\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s decision to  join the California lawsuit  is noteworthy given Trump’s call for Republicans state lawmakers to redraw their maps ahead of next fall’s elections to help the very thin GOP majority in the House.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department’s involvement in the California effort is not the first time this year that it has inserted itself into the redistricting fight.\n \n\n   \n  In July, as attention was turning to Texas’ congressional maps, a top DOJ official sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton that raised “serious concerns” about the “legality” of four districts in the state.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ official, Harmeet Dhillon, urged the state to “rectify” the issues or risk legal action from the department. The following month, several of the districts flagged by Dhillon were impacted by the state’s redistricting plan.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00-05:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a 43-day federal government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan compromise bill that ends the impasse.

\n        5:15 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  longest federal government shutdown  in history is over.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump on Wednesday night  signed  the compromise bill that ended the 43-day shutdown soon after the legislation  passed the House .\n \n\n   \n  The  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the bill extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the package, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions will continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The package fully funds the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance. Agriculture Sec. Brooke Rollins  told CNN  that all recipients should see their full funding by Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also replenishes SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund will also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It includes funding for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, rural health, caregivers, women’s health, veterans’ homelessness prevention, mental health and child care.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers\n \n\n   \n  The legislation also guarantees retroactive pay for the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown. Many missed two full paychecks, as well as a partial one, though they should receive their  back pay  in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Though President Donald Trump signed a bill during the 2018-2019 impasse that ensured federal workers would get back pay, the administration  called into question  whether furloughed employees would be compensated when this shutdown ended.\n \n\n   \n  The package also reverses several agencies’ efforts to implement staffing reductions during the shutdown, stating that workforce levels will return to what they had been prior to the lapse in appropriations. It also prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven agencies sent reduction-in-force notices to  roughly 4,000 workers  in October, though the actions were  paused  by a federal court.\n \n\n   \n    Notifying lawmakers under investigation\n \n\n   \n  The deal includes a section that requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called Arctic Frost, which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register electoral college votes for Trump from states that former president Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, slammed the inclusion of the measure, saying it would provide millions of dollars to eight senators investigated in a probe around the fake elector scheme from the 2020 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson posted on X Wednesday that Republicans lawmakers are introducing a standalone bill to repeal the provision.\n \n\n   \n    Hemp products ban\n \n\n   \n  The package includes a controversial measure that prevents the unregulated sale of hemp-based or hemp-derived products from being sold online, in gas stations or in corner stores.\n \n\n   \n  The measure does not affect non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.\n \n\n   \n  Hemp, a variety of cannabis, was  legalized  as part of the 2018 Farm Bill.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/chicago-ice-arrests-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:07:00Z","title":"Judge orders release of hundreds arrested in Illinois immigration crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of hundreds of people arrested during 'Operation Midway Blitz,' a broad immigration crackdown led by the Trump administration in Illinois.

hundreds arrested in Illinois immigration crackdown \n       \n  By Whitney Wild, Alisha Ebrahimji, Amanda Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:07 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge ordered the release of hundreds of people arrested as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to a court ruling, dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Of those arrested, 615 are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Cummings stated he would allow their release on a $1,500 bond and enrollment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Alternatives to Detention program, which can include electronic monitoring, pending the outcome of immigration proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered the government to identify the people who are eligible for release by noon Friday and paused deportation proceedings for them until the next business day after their release.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the immediate release of 13 people who were arrested in violation of a consent decree that limits warrantless arrests, specifying they are to be released on their own recognizance without bond or conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The judge further ordered the government to produce by November 19 the names and threat levels of the approximately 3,000 people arrested since June.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented people – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  Challenges remain for those ordered to be released, immigration experts said in response to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested people have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order.

Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week, finding her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his Customs and Border Protection agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  That news came days after Bovino was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/alina-habba-office-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:47:00-05:00","title":"Person ransacks New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office after being denied meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A person attempted to gain access to the New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office building, was initially denied entry due to carrying a baseball bat, and later entered without the bat.

6:04 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Remember that time you had too much   cheese, felt a bit queasy and — as a greasy sheen broke out on your forehead — you lied to yourself that it was salad from now on?\n \n\n   \n  Then spare a thought for the heroic judges at this year’s World Cheese Awards, who assembled on Thursday to anoint an aged Swiss Gruyère as the best cheese in the world for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This army of 265 cheese experts from all over the planet was tasked with wading through dairy concoctions of every shape, size, color and consistency in a large auditorium in the Swiss capital Bern. In the space of a couple of hours, each judge plowed their way through at least 40 cheeses — sniffing, stroking, crumbling, and finally, tasting to arrive at a score.\n \n\n   \n  The winner was Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen, a cheese made from cow’s milk at a small dairy in the Alpine lowlands of western Switzerland. “It’s an incredible honor,” said cheesemaker Pius Hitz, shortly after picking up the top prize.\n \n\n   \n  While the win in previous years has resulted in a surge in sales for the champion cheese, Hitz said his herd of red and white Fleckvieh   cows can rest easy. A production increase is unlikely, he said, so as not to disturb the delicate balance of the protected Gruyère market.\n \n\n   \n  Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen may have only traveled a few miles to the awards, but it was still a long journey to the top. More so for its rivals, many of which had to navigate long plane rides, tricky import legislation and the US shutdown even before the contest started.\n \n\n   \n  No fewer than 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries made it to Bern’s Festhalle venue where, as judgment day wore on, they made their presence known with cascades of intensifying odors that collided with sound waves from an ensemble of Swiss horns tooting in the corner of the auditorium.\n \n\n   \n    Soft pools of goo\n \n\n   \n  The cheeses were divided up across 110 rows of white-clothed tables under the scrutiny of two- or three-person judging teams. All wearing matching yellow aprons, they were drawn from the community of makers, mongers and mavens who make up the ranks of the international cheese cognoscenti.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before 10 a.m., they began the Herculean labor of trying to find bronze, silver, gold and “super gold” contenders among the milk-based marvels — stripped of identifying features so they can be blind tasted — stretching before them.\n \n\n   \n  Holes were bored in giant waxy wheels, slivers shaved from wedges, spoons dipped into soft pools of goo. In between tastings, palates were cleansed with sips of water, bites of crunchy apples and, in some cases, emergency swigs of Coca-Cola.\n \n\n   \n  There were cow, sheep, buffalo, camel and donkey milk   cheeses. Manchegos, Bries, Camemberts, cheddars, Parmesans, Goudas. Orange cheeses, blue cheeses, green cheeses. Cheeses covered in wax. Cheeses covered in flowers. At least one cheese doused in whiskey and red apple juice.\n \n\n   \n  Some were hard. Some crumbly. Some dense. Some were light and fluffy. Some were so soft they needed to be in jars. Some, their tops cut off to reveal a moist interior glistening with mold, looked as if they might teem with lifeforms as yet unknown to science.\n \n\n   \n  All were awarded points based on appearance, smell, taste, texture and the feeling it gives in the mouth — not always a pleasant experience, apparently.\n \n\n   \n  “There were a couple of no-swallows today,” said Emma Young, a UK cheesemonger and author judging the wares laid out on table 26, pointing out a cheese that she thought might have encountered problems during the making process.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t all bad.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s bonkers,” Young added. “I’ve tasted some of the best cheeses I’ve had in my life — and some of the worst. It’s been so much of a palate workout.” She pointed to a cheese that earned top marks thanks to a “complexity” she put down to the varieties of milk used.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Biting into a cloud’\n \n\n   \n  “If only it tasted as beautiful as it looks,” said Ashley Morton, a judge on table 11, where an unusually bright blue cheese, made using spirulina algae, was attracting camera phones. Morton, a “cheese ambassador” originally from New York who goes by the nickname Brieyoncé, favored a raw goat cheese coated in a gray substance that was “almost like biting into a cloud.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look at the fruit level here,” said Jen Shelton, an organic milk expert originally from Kansas, discussing a large wheel of cheese covered in pressed grapes with fellow table-52 judge Charles Beauquesne, from France. The cheese then scattered onto the table. “It’s very crumbly,” she added. “Milky, but quite dry. The grapes give it a little bit of sweetness, but it’s claggy.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair made a note of the cheese’s score, wiped down their utensils with a paper towel   and moved on to the next candidate.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, many of the judges had made their final selection, carrying “super gold” winners to a separate judging area where a team of seasoned cheese experts pared the field down to 14 finalists. These were then tasted and scored live on stage, like an aromatic “Dancing with the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  The shortlist included a Japanese soft goat’s cheese with a texture like whipped cream, a UK hard cheese the color of a deep sunset, one US cheese and, inevitably, several more Swiss cheeses. It’s widely recognized that entries from the host country have a home advantage — cheeses are not great travelers — but locals don’t always take the crown. A Gruyère won in 2022 when the contest was staged in Wales.\n \n\n   \n  John Farrand, managing director of the event’s organizers, the UK-based Guild of Fine Food, said the World Cheese Awards stand out above other dairy contests around the planet because it can claim to be truly global — staged in different countries and involving such a diverse cast of entrants and judges. In 2026, the contest will move to Córdoba in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  The winning cheese of 2025 was championed by Perry Wakeman, one of the top-level judges who normally is found aging cheese at Rennet & Rind, near Cambridge, England. The Gruyère was a worthy winner, he said, describing its complexity: “Butterscotch, caramel. Savory, some fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal. The length was unbelievable. Three cheeses on, we could still taste it.”\n \n\n   \n  For onlookers, the cheese judging could be a frustrating process. Concerns over foot and mouth disease and other agricultural health problems meant that only judges who’d signed a waiver were permitted to sample the produce under the terms of the contest’s special import license.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the day, the auditorium tables were still groaning with leftover cheese that would sadly never be eaten. The contest organizers said that the remnants don’t completely go to waste, but would be recycled locally and “turned into energy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/americas/venezuela-military-us-tensions-explainer-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"How Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era military stacks up against US forces in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the growing US military presence in the Caribbean, particularly the deployment of the USS Gerald R.

They note that the ship’s arrival marks the largest US military presence in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself – described as the US Navy’s “ most lethal combat platform ” – the US has amassed roughly 15,000 personnel in the region alongside more than a dozen warships – including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship and amphibious assault vessels – and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  That sort of firepower brings into sharp relief what experts characterize as the aging Soviet-era equipment Venezuela would be relying on if US President Donald Trump  were to decide  on military action inside the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the forces at Caracas’ disposal:\n \n\n   \n    A tough, but aging, Soviet image\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s conventional military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), has built a reputation over the past two decades as a regional military power a cut above most of its neighbors in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that image was forged through the sustained acquisition of Russian equipment under Maduro’s predecessor, the late President Hugo Chávez, a former professional soldier who owed his ascent to power to the revolutionary movement he founded within the armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  After Chávez became president in 1999 (seven years after he organized a failed military coup), he funneled the country’s massive oil resources into the military, buying Russian equipment due to an informal US embargo and placing military men in key government positions.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, weapons systems such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 battle tanks, S-300, Pechora and Buk anti-aircraft missiles, portable Igla-S systems and Kalashnikov rifles – all designed in Soviet times, have come to define the FANB’s image. The arsenal distinguishes the Venezuelan forces from other militaries in the region, which tend to rely more heavily on US or European weaponry (though Venezuela still has some aging US-designed equipment from pre-Chávez days).\n \n\n   \n    A paper tiger?\n \n\n   \n  The problem for Venezuela is that while on paper it has a relatively well-equipped military, question marks hang over the maintenance of its equipment and the training of its personnel – not least because the country has suffered more than a decade of economic hardship, one of the world’s  highest rates of inflation  and a drop in oil production, all made worse by US sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  Partly due to this economic collapse, about 7.9 million Venezuelans – many of them young people of military service age – have left the country, according to UN data.\n \n\n   \n  Though the government “recently resumed modest maintenance and modernization efforts,” according to a 2024 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), years of underinvestment have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  “The FANB has a rather low level of operational capability and asset availability, partly because they’ve been through more than a decade of economic crisis in the country,” Andrei Serbin Pont, an analyst specializing in defense at the CRIES think tank, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Military and militia: In numbers\n \n\n   \n  Currently, the FANB has about 123,000 active personnel. The army  has 63,000, the navy 25,500, the air force 11,500 and the national guard 23,000, according to the IISS. These are supplemented by about 8,000 reservists.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to its regular military units, Venezuela can call on the Bolivarian Militia – a reserve force made up of civilians. It was created by Chávez and named after Simon Bolívar, the revolutionary who secured the independence of numerous Latin American countries from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  However, the true size of the militia is opaque. Prior to the recent US buildup, the IISS estimated its number at 220,000, but in August Maduro claimed he would deploy 4.5 million militiamen in response. Weeks later, he said he expected to call up a total of 8.2 million – though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of their training.\n \n\n   \n    Army: Loyal, but top heavy?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower:  With its 63,000 members, Venezuela’s ground forces account for the greatest chunk of its active personnel. They also have the longest history and are most politically aligned with the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Chávez, both the current interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, passed through the army – and Padrino is still an active four-star general.\n \n\n   \n  One indicator of how entwined the government and army have become is the unusual number of generals and admirals, with promotions being doled out for political loyalty. In 2019, that number was estimated at about 2,000 by Adm. Craig Faller, then chief of the US Southern Command, in a speech to the US Congress. “More than in all of NATO,” he pointed out. (In comparison, in 2025, the US had  about 850  for an armed forces 10 times larger).\n \n\n   \n  “Ecuador is a convent, Colombia is a university, and Venezuela is a barracks,” goes an old saying, attributed to Bolívar, that sums up the relationship of Venezuelans with the army.\n \n\n   \n   Weaponry:  Notable systems bought from Russia in recent years include 92 T-72B1 tanks – similar to those being used in Ukraine – and 123 BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles, which equip the armored brigades alongside 81 AMX-30 tanks previously acquired from France, according to the IISS. Artillery systems include the Russian Msta-S self-propelled howitzer and Smerch rocket launchers.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿Led by:  The operational strategic commander of all of Venezuela’s armed forces is Domingo Antonio Hernández Lárez. His brother, Maj. Gen. Johan Alexander Hernández Lárez, is in charge of the army.\n \n\n   \n    Air Force: High standard\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  With 11,500 members, the Bolivarian Military Aviation, or air force, is the smallest of the country’s forces but takes pride of place due to the acquisition of Russian equipment that has set it apart among regional competitors in the Caribbean and most of Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  At the center of this arsenal are Sukhoi Su-30MK2s, high-performance twin-engine fighters that, even though developed in the 1980s by the Soviet Union, are unmatched in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-September, the FANB  shared videos  of two of its Su-30s armed with Kh-31 anti-ship missiles, also Russian-made, in a show of what remains its most advanced weapons system.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is thought to have had 24 of these planes at one point, but at least three have crashed, according to the IISS. The Venezuelan NGO Control Ciudadano says the accidents highlight “problems of system obsolescence and of maintenance and lack of spare parts.”\n \n\n   \n  The Su-30s coexist with a few old US F-16 fighters that Venezuela bought before Chávez came to power.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela also has Russian-built air defenses that include 12 batteries of long-range S-300 missiles; nine Buk systems and 44 Pechora units, both medium-range; and numerous portable Igla-S launchers, according to the IISS.\n \n\n   \n  These defenses, while advanced, would likely be the first targets of an opponent if a conflict were to break out, said Serbin Pont, the CRIES analyst.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Maj. Gen. Lenín Lorenzo Ramírez Villasmil.\n \n\n   \n    Navy: Weak point?\n \n\n   \n   Manpower and weaponry:  The Bolivarian Navy, whose 25,500 members are tasked primarily with operations in the Caribbean, has lagged the other services in terms of arms purchases in recent decades.\n \n\n   \n  It currently operates only one Mariscal Sucre-class frigate (manufactured in Italy) and one Type-209 submarine (manufactured in Germany) in its sea fleet, according to the IISS. It also has nine oceanic and coastal patrol vessels, including four purchased from Spain.\n \n\n   \n  “The navy lost many of its assets that it had prior to (Chavez), and these were not fully replaced. The corvettes bought from Spain were never equipped with weaponry, until a few years ago when Chilean and Iranian anti-ship missiles were installed, but they do not have viable anti-aircraft defense systems,” said Serbin Pont.\n \n\n   \n   Led by:  Adm. Ashraf Suleimán Gutiérrez.\n \n\n   \n    And the militias?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Maduro has repeatedly played up the role of the Bolivarian Militia, formed in 2008 by Chavez to provide a loyal paramilitary force that, while technically part of the armed forces, comes directly under the control of the president.\n \n\n   \n  A definitive account of how many people belong to the Bolivarian Militia, an umbrella term for various groups that range widely in experience and ability, is hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  Days after news of the US naval deployment broke, Maduro said in August he was going to “activate … more than 4.5 million militiamen” taken from “all the factories and workplaces of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Missiles and rifles for the working class, so that they may defend our homeland,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He later suggested that the militia has more than 8 million members.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the discrepancies in number, Serbin Pont said that while there were some traditional militias composed of reservists with military experience, most of the groups showcased by the government on television and social media were too inexperienced to play a decisive fighting role.\n \n\n   \n  “Those people do not have sufficient training. There is no real armed structure to mobilize those elements, and those elements would not be effective in combat,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Their real use, Serbin Pont suggested, was serving “as an intelligence network and a repressive threat against the civilian population precisely because they are based on a network that penetrates the whole of society.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/takeaways-lindsey-halligan-comey-james-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:55:00Z","title":"Pointed questions and gasps in courtroom: Takeaways from hearing on fate of Trump’s handpicked prosecutor Lindsey Halligan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The hearing in court on November 13, 2025, centered on the constitutional validity of President Donald Trump’s appointment of Lindsey Halligan, a White House adviser, as interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Katelyn  Polantz, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:55 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James battled the Justice Department in court Thursday over whether President Donald Trump lawfully appointed a prosecutor to go after his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  The two cases suffer from “a fundamental defect,” Comey’s attorney, Ephraim McDowell began the hearing, arguing that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan for the Eastern District of Virginia brought his client’s case before a grand jury alone despite having “no authority to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, then a White House adviser, was appointed after the previous interim US Attorney for the district was pressured to pursue indictments against the two, who Trump repeatedly has attacked and demanded be charged.\n \n\n   \n  One lawyer for the Justice Department, Henry Whitaker, argued Thursday that Comey and James were trying to “elevate what is at best a paperwork error.”\n \n\n   \n  Comey is charged with making a false statement to Congress and James with bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    The limit does not exist, DOJ argues\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of Thursday’s dispute is whether the 120-day limit imposed for interim US attorneys is truly a limit or a guidance for when the attorney general needs to reassess their selection.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorneys argue that following the limit, an interim appointee must be confirmed by the Senate or have their appointment extended by the judges of the district they serve.\n \n\n   \n  If Halligan can be appointed as the head prosecutor of the Alexandria, Virginia, office despite the limit on individuals serving in the job on an interim basis, McDowell argued, then that guardrail is useless.\n \n\n   \n  Her appointment, he said, acted as an “evasion of the Appointments Clause and separation of powers.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued Thursday that the “government’s reading” of the federal law at issue requires the judge “to add words” to it.\n \n\n   \n  The underlying statute, Whitaker said, doesn’t say the attorney general can only “cram multiple appointments” in one, 120-day period, but instead can continue to select and re-evaluate.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not argue that the attorney general,” Whitaker continued, has a “fire and forget” authority. “The idea that we are going to try to evade Senate confirmation,” is “fanciful.”\n \n\n   \n     US v Trump  \n \n\n   \n  The Judge presiding over the issue of Halligan’s appointment, Cameron McGowan Currie, pressed Whitaker Thursday on whether the government believed the classified documents case in Florida against Donald Trump was incorrectly dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in that case,  Aileen Cannon,  found that then-special counsel Jack Smith was wrongly appointed in part because the Senate had not confirmed him to the role.\n \n\n   \n  The question drew gasps from the audience in the courtroom and came toward the tail end of the hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker proceeded to walk a tight legal rope by arguing that Smith would not have even met the qualifications for a US Attorney and enjoyed “unique and broad” powers as a special counsel.\n \n\n   \n  “You wouldn’t have appointed Jack Smith” as a US attorney, Whitaker said, adding that “the attorney general has full authority” to appoint those who qualify.\n \n\n   \n     Missing time  \n \n\n   \n  Currie also laid into Whitaker during the hearing on whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had reviewed the grand jury transcript in James Comey’s case, noting there was no record of anything that happened after 4:28pm ET that day. Comey wasn’t indicted for nearly two hours after that, according to available court transcripts.\n \n\n   \n  “It became obvious to me that the attorney general could not have reviewed” the entire proceeding, Currie said, adding that it appeared “there was no court reporter present” at the time of the missing portion.\n \n\n   \n  In preparation for Thursday’s hearing, Currie privately reviewed the transcripts and said previously that she thought looking at the transcripts was “necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN following the hearing, a representative for the Justice Department denied that there was anything missing from the transcript.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no ‘missing two hours.’ That time period refers to when the jurors were deliberating behind closed doors, which would not be included in a transcription,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ, however, did not offer an explanation for the gap in court.\n \n\n   \n  Currie said she would issue a decision over Halligan’s appointment before Thanksgiving, with both trials currently set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/20th-strike-us-military-boats-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:58:00-05:00","title":"US military carried out 20th strike on alleged drug boats, killing 4, official says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military conducted its 20th strike on an alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean, killing four people, bringing the cumulative death toll from such operations to 80.

Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If  President Donald Trump  has nothing to hide vis-à-vis  Jeffrey Epstein , he sure has a weird way of showing it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the convicted sex offender, but he’s doing a great job of looking suspicious.\n \n\n   \n  And that could be a political problem in and of itself – regardless of whatever ultimately comes from the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  A batch of  newly released Epstein emails  on Wednesday added details about Trump’s past relationship with Epstein but no smoking guns. (The White House said the emails “prove absolutely nothing.”)\n \n\n   \n  In one of those emails from 2011, Epstein expressed surprise to accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump’s name hadn’t surfaced amid accusations involving Epstein. Epstein added that Trump had at one point spent hours with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2019, Epstein appeared to signal Trump was quite aware of Maxwell recruiting girls from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 2000s, saying “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  While some have claimed these emails show Trump had knowledge of or even involvement in Epstein’s crimes, it’s not nearly so evident. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, has acknowledged meeting Trump and never accused him of wrongdoing. And Trump has acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees including Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. (The big question there is whether Trump had any inkling about what Maxwell was recruiting a minor female like Giuffre  for .)\n \n\n   \n  But also notable on Wednesday was Trump’s reaction.\n \n\n   \n  As all this was going down, he and his White House seemed preoccupied with what appeared to an  11th-hour campaign to thwart  a House discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing the full Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  With the petition due to get a decisive 218th signature when a new Democratic member of Congress was sworn in later that day, the White House held a meeting in the Situation Room with a key GOP lawmaker who’d signed on, while another said she was playing phone tag with the president. Both GOP congresswomen later told CNN Trump hadn’t personally lobbied them to remove their names. But the president also  publicly pressured  Republicans who sided with Democrats on forcing Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  It was a weird move, to be sure. No Republicans removed their names from the petition, and Speaker Mike Johnson quickly said he would schedule a vote for next week on compelling the Justice Department to release the full files.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the measure passes in the House, that’s not the end of the story. The GOP-led Senate would still have to take it up, and Trump would still have to sign it. So it’s not like this will cause the imminent release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s resistance to something his base has long clamored for – and the optics of the Situation Room meeting in particular – would only seem to deepen the huge suspicions that a large number of Americans already harbor about the government covering up Epstein-related matters.\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at the big point here – and the political danger for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  This is merely the latest baffling episode in the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. Among  the others :\n \n\n   \n  Even if Trump doesn’t have anything to hide, the danger here is in making it look a whole lot like he does.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are primed to believe there’s a real conspiracy beneath the surface, and Trump’s actions risk making him own it.\n \n\n   \n  The polling tells the tale.\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps Trump’s worst issue, by the margin who disapprove. Americans generally disapprove of his and the administration’s handling of the Epstein matter by around a 3-to-1 margin in most polls. The most recent poll, a Reuters-Ipsos survey from last month, showed Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of it 57%-19%. Independents disapproved 59%-10%.\n \n\n   \n  And like virtually every other survey on the topic, not even a majority of Republicans said they approved: 44%.\n \n\n   \n  Americans are also quite unhappy with the administration’s transparency and disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  An August  Pew Research Center survey  showed 63% of Americans and even 38% of Republican-leaning Americans had little or no trust in what the Trump administration was saying about the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, an  August Quinnipiac University poll  showed voters said 73%-16% that the Justice Department wasn’t being transparent about its investigation.\n \n\n   \n  All of that said, this is clearly not a top-tier issue for most Americans. Relatively few have seemed to be paying close attention. Only about one-quarter were following it “extremely” or “very” closely in the  Pew survey .\n \n\n   \n  But crucially, it’s also something Americans are liable to believe the worst about.\n \n\n   \n  To wit:\n \n\n   \n  That same poll showed even 33% of Republicans said Trump hadn’t gone far enough to get to the bottom of Epstein matters.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, only 26% of Americans and just 55% of Republicans were willing to rule out that Trump had engaged in crime with Epstein. (Trump hasn’t been charged with any crimes related to Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s a lot of Americans who are inclined to believe the worst here – or are at least willing to entertain it. People also seem to have very little confidence and trust in what the administration is doing or saying about all of this.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s conduct just keeps giving them reason to be suspicious.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/11/28/entertainment/holiday-movies-bingo-game","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:08:00-05:00","title":"Give Yourself the Gift of Playing Holiday Movie Bingo","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes 'holiday movie bingo' as a fun, non-controversial activity to facilitate conversation during Thanksgiving gatherings, especially when sensitive topics arise.

About 75% of Americans had received  at least one dose  of the first versions of the vaccine by early 2022, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. But only about 23% of American adults got a covid shot during the 2024-25 virus season, well below the 47% of American adults who got a flu shot. The vaccination rates for  flu ,  measles , and tetanus are also going down.\n \n\n   \n  Yet covid remains a serious, potentially deadly health risk, listed as the primary cause of death on roughly 31,400 death certificates last year. By comparison, flu killed  about 6,500  people and pneumonia, a common complication of the flu, killed  an additional 41,600 ,  CDC data shows .\n \n\n   \n  As millions of Americans decide whether to get a covid shot this season, public health researchers worry vaccination rates will slide further, especially because Hispanic and Black Americans and those under 30 have lower rates, exposing them to serious complications such as long covid. Under the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the federal government has narrowed its recommendations on the covid vaccine, leading to a hodgepodge of rules on pharmacy access, with Americans living in Republican states often facing more barriers to getting a shot.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of misinformation is going around regarding covid,” said  Alein Haro-Ramos , an assistant professor of health, society, and behavior at the University of California-Irvine. “Vaccine hesitancy is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Food and Drug Administration  narrowed approval  for covid vaccines to those 65 or older and to adults and children with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for serious complications from covid.\n \n\n   \n  A month later, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  voted to recommend  “shared clinical decision-making” on the vaccine, pulling back from advising all adults to get vaccinated. The committee advised doctors to emphasize to adults under 65 and children that the benefits of the vaccine are greatest for those with underlying health conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance is rebutted by infectious disease experts who say most adults and children should get both the flu and covid vaccines, which are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. Several independent medical organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have reiterated their support for broad adoption of covid vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen states have taken steps to ensure most people can get a covid shot at the pharmacy without a prescription, with many states tying their policies to the advice given by medical organizations. And many of those states require insurers to cover vaccines at no cost, according to  a KFF analysis . In several other states, predominantly Republican, pharmacy access to vaccines may require a prescription.\n \n\n   \n  Among the most commonly cited reasons for covid vaccine hesitation are fears about side effects, long-term health consequences, the effectiveness of the vaccine, and mistrust of pharmaceutical corporations and government officials, according to  a 2024 review  of multiple studies, published in the journal Vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Covid vaccine hesitancy in the 2024-25 virus season was higher among Latinos; African Americans; men; uninsured people; and people living in Republican-leaning states, CDC data shows.\n \n\n   \n  Latino adults were significantly less likely than adults from most other racial and ethnic groups to get a covid shot last season, with a vaccination rate around 15%.\n \n\n   \n  Some of that may be due to age: A  disproportionate share  of Latinos are young. But public policy actions may also be a factor. The first Trump administration, for example, tied Medicaid to “public charge,” a rule allowing the federal government to deny an immigrant a green card or visa based on their dependence on taxpayer-funded programs. Some Latinos may be afraid to sign up for social services even after the Biden administration reversed those first-term Trump actions.\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos co-authored  a study  published in 2024 that found many Latinos were hesitant to get vaccinated because of fears about their immigration status, and that experiencing health discrimination like care denials or delays increased their vaccine hesitancy.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you trust the health care system, broadly speaking? Do you want to provide your information — your name, your address?” Haro-Ramos said. “Trust is critical.”\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos said the problem has likely worsened since her study was published. The Trump administration  revealed this summer  that it would give the personal information of Medicaid enrollees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many Latinos are  canceling doctor appointments  to head off possible confrontation with immigration enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  “People are avoiding leaving their homes at all costs,” Haro-Ramos said.\n \n\n   \n   Janani Rajbhandari-Thapa , an associate professor at the University of Georgia College of Public Health, recently  co-authored a study  of covid vaccination among nearly 1,500 African Americans living in south Georgia. The study found that participants were more likely to listen to their health care providers than faith leaders or co-workers when seeking advice on getting vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of those studied had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but those who were unvaccinated were more likely to agree with false statements that tied vaccines to miscarriages, components’ remaining in the body for a long time, or even to the conspiracy that they implant a computer chip in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the clinicians who can take the messages about vaccination — that these are myths,” Rajbhandari-Thapa said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though covid hospitalization and death rates have fallen dramatically since the worst days of the pandemic, fatal complications related to covid remain most common among older people.  Around 89%  of U.S. covid deaths last year were among people 65 and older, compared with  about 81%  of flu and pneumonia deaths.\n \n\n   \n  As the pandemic falls into the rearview, young people have developed a sense of invincibility. Only 11% of Americans 18 to 29 received a vaccine during the 2024-25 virus season, the lowest vaccination rate among adult age groups. That’s far below the  70% of young adults  who got at least one dose of the initial covid vaccines by November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  While many people get covid after receiving a covid shot, because the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection wears off pretty fast, some misunderstand the purpose of the shot, said  Otto Yang , an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health.\n \n\n   \n  “They think, ‘Well, the vaccine didn’t prevent me from getting covid, so the vaccine didn’t work,’” Yang said. “And what they’re not seeing is that the vaccine prevented them from getting severely ill, which is ultimately the most important thing.”\n \n\n   \n  And the vaccine can help prevent long covid, which is a problem for all ages, Yang said. A recent Northwestern University study  found that  younger adults suffer worse symptoms of long covid than older adults.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Yang said, it is not a consistent choice to get a flu vaccine but forgo a covid vaccine, since both are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. It is clear, he added, that people with compromised immune systems and those at higher risk should get a covid shot. The decision is “a little bit less clear” for others but “probably most adults should be getting vaccinated, just like it’s recommended for the flu vaccine, as well as most children.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00-05:00","title":"Wall Street has its worst day in a month as traders dial back expectations for Fed rate cuts","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street experienced its worst day in a month on Thursday, November 13, 2025, as investors sold shares, particularly in technology stocks, amid growing uncertainty over delayed economic data caused by the end of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.

   4:07 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US stocks closed sharply lower Thursday as investors sold shares in technology companies and volatility picked up on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow fell 798 points, or 1.65%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.66% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.29%.\n \n\n   \n  Investors also assessed how long it might take for economic data releases to be rebooted after the  end of the government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The House on Wednesday evening approved a funding measure that had been passed by the Senate. The bill was signed by President Donald Trump in the late evening, officially ending the longest US government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  Now Wall Street is focused on the  backlog of government data  that was delayed because of the shutdown — and how it might impact the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “Lacking fresh economic data, markets have become increasingly jittery in recent weeks,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note. “Now, as the government shutdown ends, each long-awaited data release or policy announcement will have the potential to move markets dramatically.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq each had their worst day since October 10, when a flare up in  US-China trade tensions  sent stocks lower.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Fear and Greed index  moved from “fear” into “extreme fear.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 18% as volatility picked up.\n \n\n   \n  “The gears of the government should be working again soon, and while that is a relief for markets and the economy, there is still plenty of uncertainty, particularly around the missed inflation and jobs data and how these fronts have been faring,” Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Traders on Thursday were pricing in roughly a 52% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 63% chance on Wednesday and a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The data blackout has made the Federal Reserve’s job difficult, but we still expect them to cut interest rates again in December,” Schleif said. “We expect markets to grind higher — though likely with continued volatility.”\n \n\n   \n  The sell-off in stocks worsened in the afternoon. The third-quarter earnings season is also winding down, meaning there are fewer fundamental catalysts, and markets are more susceptible to moves based on investor sentiment.\n \n\n   \n    Tech woes continue\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks as investors have voiced concerns about relatively expensive valuations. There has been rising skepticism about whether AI companies will be able to produce enough profits to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla shares ( TSLA ) fell 6.6%. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) fell 6.5%, and Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) fell 3.6%. Oracle shares ( ORCL ) fell 4.15%.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are reevaluating the prices they’re paying for big tech and AI stocks,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong tech rally in recent months, investors have been taking profits and rotating into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq has dropped nearly 5% since closing at a record high on October 29. The tech-heavy index has shed almost $2 trillion in market value across that time period.\n \n\n   \n  Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he recently trimmed some of his exposure to tech.\n \n\n   \n  “It just had such a monstrous run that it just made sense to take the profits and find other opportunities,” Samana said.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow’s Thursday decline comes after back-to-back days of record highs. The blue-chip index closed above 48,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday as investors moved into sectors including financials and health care.\n \n\n   \n  Walt Disney shares ( DIS ) fell 7.8% on Thursday after the company reported earnings that did not impress Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, bitcoin fell roughly 3.3% on Thursday and traded around $98,250. The cryptocurrency has struggled to regain ground since tumbling in recent weeks. Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n    Fed back in focus\n \n\n   \n  Investors are trying to discern the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting in December.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate cuts in September and October helped provide a tailwind for stocks. Investors could get spooked if central bankers hold rates steady in December due to delayed data and a cloudy view of the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “If sticky inflation forces the Fed to maintain restrictive policy, the cost of capital remains a headwind for valuations,” David Miller, CIO at Catalyst Funds, said in an email.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/chuy-garcia-election-gluesenkamp-perez","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00Z","title":"House Democrat Accuses Fellow Democrat of Attempting to ‘Anoint an Heir’ in Surprise Floor Move","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a surprise move during a critical government shutdown vote, House Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez accused Illinois Representative Chuy García of attempting to 'anoint an heir' by designating his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, as the sole successor to his seat after García announced he would not seek re-election.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington took to the floor to launch the process of sanctioning her colleague Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for the timing of his decision to retire — which meant that his hand-picked successor was the only person registered to run for his seat.\n \n\n   \n  Gluesenkamp Perez announced on the floor that she intends to force a vote to condemn García for the move, accusing him of “undermining the process of a free and fair election.” She is using special procedural powers — known as privilege — that mean her resolution is likely to get a vote on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement after her floor speech, Gluesenkamp Perez said García is attempting to “anoint an heir.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we fail to hold our colleagues accountable for this subversion of elections, we own the consequences. Americans bled and died to secure the right to elect their leaders. We can’t expect to be taken seriously in the fight for free and fair elections if we turn a blind eye to election denial on our side of the aisle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The move by the Washington Democrat shocked her own party. Multiple members told CNN that their party — including leadership — had no idea it was coming. Some were angry, insisting that Gluesenkamp Perez was going after García at an already fragile moment for the Democratic party, which was splintered over the ending of the 43-day government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But some Democrats have also called out García for the timing of his decision not to seek reelection in a way that effectively meant no other candidate could enter the race. That includes Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey — who succeeded former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was forced out of Congress because of a corruption scandal.\n \n\n   \n  “Rep Chuy García’s decision to end his re-election at the last second and plant his chief of staff as the only candidate to succeed him was undemocratic and should not be allowed. Standing against corruption means standing up no matter which political party violates,” Kim  posted on X  after Gluesenkamp Perez announced her petition on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  García announced on November 4 that he would not run again for his House seat, citing the health of his wife, the death of his daughter in 2023 and his formal adoption of his grandchild just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, filed petitions with the Illinois State Board of Elections to run for the seat that same day, just ahead of the 5 p.m. deadline for filing. But the congressman had already planned not to run, according to a report by  the Chicago Sun-Times.  (Patty Garcia has no relation to the congressman.)\n \n\n   \n  The congressman addressed the criticism  in an interview  with a local Illinois political publication, Capitol Fax, saying “I think I followed the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  As for his decision, García said many in his family were “begging” him not to run again after the adoption of his grandchild and his daughter’s death two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Those were just really big factors in me deciding that I could not, in good conscience, do it again, and decided in Washington one of those nights that the only recourse we had was to look at an option. And that’s when I thought that we could try to get my chief, Patty Garcia, on the ballot,” García told Capitol Fax.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN for comment, García’s office referred to a statement in which he said he “followed every rule and every filing requirement laid out by the State of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “Congressman García made a deeply personal decision based on his health, his wife’s worsening condition and his responsibility to the grandchildren he is raising after the death of his daughter,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  And some of his colleagues have defended the congressman.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois  called  García an “an unwavering fighter for our democracy and our communities,” in response to the move to sanction him.\n \n\n   \n  “It is disappointing that someone willing to compromise working families’ healthcare would use this moment for a cheap political stunt aimed at distracting people from an indefensible vote on tonight’s CR,” she said, referring to the fact that Gluesenkamp Perez  voted in favor of the bill  to reopen the government, which did not include an extension of expiring health care subsidies – a key demand from Democrats in the funding fight.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/tech/ai-safety-task-force-attorneys-general-openai-microsoft","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"OpenAI and Microsoft team up with state law enforcers on AI safety task force","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Carolina and Utah attorneys general, Jeff Jackson and Derek Brown, have launched a bipartisan AI Task Force with OpenAI and Microsoft to establish basic safety safeguards for AI technologies, particularly to protect children and prevent harm such as delusions or self-harm.

enforcers on AI safety task force \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Artificial intelligence is playing a greater role in everything from homework to jobs and even romantic companionship — all without much oversight to guarantee the tech is being developed and used safely.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a pair of state attorneys general are teaming up with two of the biggest companies in tech to change that.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, and Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, a Republican, announced on Monday the formation of the AI Task Force. OpenAI and Microsoft have already signed on to the effort, and the attorneys general expect other state regulators and AI companies to join, too. The group will work to develop “basic safeguards” that AI developers should implement to prevent harm to users, especially children, and to identify new risks as the technology develops.\n \n\n   \n  There is no overarching federal law regulating AI, and some federal lawmakers have even sought to restrict regulation of the technology. Jackson and Brown were among the 40 attorneys general who earlier this year successfully  pushed for the removal  of an  AI regulation moratorium  from Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cuts package that could have blocked enforcement of state laws for a decade. (One federal AI law did pass this year: the  Take It Down Act , which specifically cracks down on non-consensual deepfake pornography.)\n \n\n   \n  Concerns about AI safety risks have only escalated in recent months, amid a growing  string of reports  about the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Facebook-parent Meta have also been scrambling to block young people from accessing adult content.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said he’s not hopeful Congress will move quickly to regulate AI.\n \n\n   \n  “They did nothing with respect to social media, nothing with respect for internet privacy, not even for kids, and they came very close to moving in the wrong direction on AI by handcuffing states from doing anything real,” Jackson told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of the task force announcement.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the leading AI companies have begun to diverge in their approaches to safety. For example, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  said last month  that the company’s investments in child safety protections would enable it to “treat adults like adults,” including allowing verified adult users to engage in erotic conversations. Shortly after, Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman  told CNN  his company would not allow sexual or romantic conversations, even for adults, and that he wanted to make “an AI you trust your kids to use” without a separate, young user experience.\n \n\n   \n  “This effort reflects a shared commitment to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence while working collaboratively with stakeholders to understand and mitigate unintended consequences,” Kia Floyd, Microsoft’s general manager of state government affairs, said in a statement on joining the task force. “By partnering with state leaders and industry peers, we can promote innovation and consumer protection to ensure AI serves the public good.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever guardrails the task force develops will technically be voluntary.

EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A self-styled clairvoyant who said a statue of the Virgin Mary cried tears of blood and claimed she could multiply gnocchi for her followers, has been charged with fraud, along with her husband. They are due to stand trial in April.\n \n\n   \n  For years, faithful Catholic pilgrims flocked to a field outside Rome, belonging to Gisella Cardia – born Maria Giuseppa Scarpulla – and her husband Gianni Cardia, to pray in front of the statue of the Madonna of Trevignano. The statue was said to weep blood and transmit messages Gisella Cardia claimed were both from God and Satan, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who have been denounced by the Vatican, created a shrine to the Madonna statuette and regularly held prayer events, during which Gisella Cardia would take to the stage and preach.\n \n\n   \n  Her followers have told media that, although Gisella Cardia did not multiply bread and loaves, she would often show up with one box of pizza or a plate of gnocchi that somehow multiplied to feed the masses.\n \n\n   \n  The couple also collected nearly €400,000 ($465,000) between 2018 and 2024 from those who came to pray in front of the statue, promising that the money would go to children’s hospital, the prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia, which has charged them with fraud, confirmed to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor’s office has alleged that the money was used to spruce up the pilgrimage site and for a $40,000 car, and was not taxed in accordance with religious donations.\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who will face trial in April, are accused of staging “apparitions” to make it seem that blood was flowing from the Madonna statue’s eyes for money.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged scam came to light in 2023 after a former follower contacted police. In an interview with state broadcaster RAI, he said he told officers that he’d found a coffin in his car following an alleged confrontation with Gisella Cardia.\n \n\n   \n  Police launched an investigation, testing the blood which turned out to match Gisella Cardia’s DNA, geneticist Emiliano Giardina of the public prosecutor’s office in Civitavecchia said in a court report.\n \n\n   \n  At that time,  the Vatican  released a statement warning pilgrims to be wary of “the alleged apparitions and revelations reported by Mrs. Gisella Cardia… and by Mr. Gianni Cardia,” which it said had been judged to be  not supernatural .\n \n\n   \n  The couple’s lawyer Solange Marchignoli told CNN Thursday: “(Gisella) Cardia is relieved, as she believes this moment represents an opportunity to transparently reveal the truth of the facts and to definitively put an end to all forms of speculation, misunderstanding, and controversy that have, despite herself, involved her in recent months.” Marchignoli added that the couple “welcomed the trial and said it would be a necessary step to finally clarify, in the appropriate venues, every aspect of the case involving her.”\n \n\n   \n  One woman told a local news channel in an interview later broadcast by RAI that she witnessed Gisella Cardia multiplying pizza.\n \n\n   \n  “We were at her house for a rosary, and there were about 20 or 25 of us. After the rosary, we decided to stay there for a while to talk. At one point, someone brought a box of pizza. A person near us cut it and each of us went over there and took a little piece at a time… We all ate it. The pizza was never ending and this is all the work of Divine Providence through Gisella,” the woman said.\n \n\n   \n  Gisella Cardia herself also recounted a similar instance in an interview with La Repubblica newspaper when allegations of into fraud first surfaced in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “There was lunch left over, consisting of gnocchi and a bit of rabbit,” she said. “Everyone ate the gnocchi and rabbit, 15 people, and it’s incredible. While I was dishing out the gnocchi, the food didn’t get any smaller, nor did the pot.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:35:00-13:00","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 80","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Between September 2 and November 10, 2025, the United States conducted 20 military strikes in international waters, killing 80 people and destroying 21 boats, as part of a campaign declared by the Trump administration as an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels.

Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 80 people in 20 strikes that have destroyed 21 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor.

Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:20 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If you plan to max out your contributions to your 401(k) or IRA next year, you will get to save a little more than you could this year.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS on Thursday announced cost-of-living adjustments to federal contribution limits for 2026 for key retirement savings vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  401(k) participants will be allowed to   put away up to $24,500 next year, a $1,000 increase from the current limit. The same increase will apply to 403(b)s, governmental 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone 50 or older in those plans can save more. Next year the so-called “catch-up contribution” limit rises to $8,000 from $7,500, for a total of $32,500. But those who are ages 60, 61, 62, and 63 may save even more – up to an additional $11,250, which is the same limit as this year, for a total of $35,750.\n \n\n   \n  There is another change, however, for the highest-earning older savers. Starting in 2026, if in the prior year you made more than $145,000 in FICA wages — that is income subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes — any catch-up contributions you make will  automatically be subject to income tax . So they essentially will be treated as  Roth 401(k)  contributions.\n \n\n   \n    New savings and income limits for traditional and Roth IRAs\n \n\n   \n  If you are eligible to put money into a tax-deductible IRA or an after- tax Roth IRA, you will be allowed to save up to $7,500, which is $500 more than you can sock away this year.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit if you’re at least 50 will be $1,100, up from $1,000 today.\n \n\n   \n  The income thresholds to determine whether you’re eligible to save in those IRA vehicles are also being adjusted.\n \n\n   \n  Those thresholds differ based both on your marital status and whether or not you’re covered by a retirement savings plan at work. (Here are the IRS’ new  income threshold breakdowns  across those categories.)\n \n\n   \n    Limits for Saver’s Credit and SIMPLE Accounts also change\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a low- or moderate-income worker, you may be eligible for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, also known as the  Saver’s Credit . It’s essentially a government-provided match on at least a portion of your retirement contributions to an IRA or workplace retirement plan. The credit, which won’t change next year, is worth up to $1,000 for single filers; and up to $2,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n \n\n   \n  To qualify in 2026, your income may not exceed $40,250 if you’re a single filer or married filing separately, which is up $750 from this year’s income limit. If you file as head of household, your income may not be more than $60,375, up $1,125 compared to this year. And it may not top $80,500 if you’re married filing jointly, up $1,500.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re employed by a small business offering a  SIMPLE IRA  at work and put retirement savings into a SIMPLE account, you may save up to $17,000 next year, up from $16,500 today; although for some types of SIMPLE accounts the contribution limit rises to $18,100, up from $17,600.\n \n\n   \n  And the catch-up contribution limit will be increased to $4,000 from $3,500 currently. Savers who are between the ages of 60 and 63 may contribute an additional $5,250, which is the same as this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/toy-story-5-teaser-watch-now","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-05:00","title":"Screens are the enemy in new ‘Toy Story 5’ teaser trailer","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The new teaser trailer for 'Toy Story 5' raises a poignant question about the future of physical toys in a world increasingly dominated by screens.

teaser trailer for “Toy Story 5,” released by Pixar on Tuesday, which picks up on the familiar parenting conundrum about screentime.\n \n\n   \n  The brief clip, set to the strains of INXS’ “Never Tear Us Apart,” shows a new package being delivered to Bonnie Anderson, the little girl who inherited all of Andy’s toys back in 2010’s emotional “Toy Story 3.”\n \n\n   \n  As our favorite collection of anthropomorphic playthings – including Woody, Buzz, Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, Jessie and others – look on in anticipatory horror, the package is opened to reveal a frog-framed tablet named Lilypad, who beckons to Bonnie, “Let’s play!”\n \n\n   \n  Judging from the girl’s enthusiastic reaction, the toys in this story will have their work cut out for them to remain relevant.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still unclear, though, whether the film will address the glaring, meta-tinged irony that said toys have been agents of the screen invasion themselves, as characters in a 30-year-old movie franchise.\n \n\n   \n  “Toy Story 5” will bring back usual suspects Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack, among others, as part of the voice cast.\n \n\n   \n  The movie welcomes franchise newcomers Ernie Hudson, Conan O’Brien and Greta Lee as the voice of Lilypad, according to Pixar’s trailer description on YouTube.\n \n\n   \n  The film is set for release in theaters in the summer 2026.\n \n\n

\n  Justice Neil Gorsuch said Thursday he will co-author a children’s book next year focused on the Declaration of Independence, a departure from the headier book the conservative jurist authored last year that  targeted burdensome government  regulations.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be titled “Heroes of 1776: The Story of The Declaration of Independence” and is set to publish in May, which Gorsuch indicated is timed to correspond to the 250th anniversary of the document’s signing.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the next year we’ll celebrate a lot of dates and events with fireworks and   I wanted to share with children some stories about the courage and sacrifice of the heroes behind 1776 who gave us our Constitution and our liberties,” Gorsuch told Fox News in an interview Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The book will be published by HarperCollins.\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch, who was President Donald Trump’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, published a decidedly adult book just last year that lamented out-of-control government bureaucracies and told the stories of Americans he said had been hampered by overzealous regulations and red tape.\n \n\n   \n  In that book, Gorsuch told the story a commercial fisherman in Florida who was threatened with a 20-year prison sentence for tossing undersized grouper overboard – a case that was decided by  the Supreme Court  in 2015. He also wrote about Marty Hahne, a Missouri magician who became a  cause célèbre for anti-regulation advocates   a decade ago when the US Department of Agriculture required him to draft an emergency disaster plan for Casey, a rabbit he pulled out of a hat at his shows.\n \n\n   \n  In June,  Gorsuch reported receiving a little over $250,000 in book royalties  – a roughly equal amount to what he reported a year before. Supreme Court justices, who earn more than $300,000 a year, are barred from receiving more than about $30,000 in outside income annually. But book revenue is exempt from that policy, creating an incentive for the nine to put pen to paper beyond their opinions.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, has authored several children’s books, including one this year. Sotomayor reported nearly $134,000 in book-related income in her most recent financial disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and Amy Coney Barrett both zigzagged across the country this fall promoting new books.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Brett Kavanaugh is working on book now. So is Justice  Samuel Alito .\n \n\n   \n  Gorsuch is writing the book with Janie Nitze, who also co-authored Gorsuch’s book last year. It will be illustrated by Chris Ellison.\n \n\n   \n  In a promotional statement, HarperCollins said the new book would “dive into the stories of ordinary people willing to do extraordinary things” around the time of nation’s founding.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to know our shared history, and I think if we do that we’ll come to realize that all the things that separate us pale in comparison to the things that unite us,” Gorsuch told Fox. “I wanted to be part of America’s celebration and bringing us together again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/oklahoma-execution-wood","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:18:00-05:00","title":"Oklahoma governor spares the life of inmate just before he was to be executed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt commuted the death sentence of Tremane Wood to life in prison without parole, just before a scheduled lethal injection in November 2025.

Kevin Stitt has spared the life of a death row inmate just before he was set to receive a lethal injection on Thursday, commuting the man’s sentence to life in prison without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt formally granted clemency to Tremane Wood, 46, who was scheduled to die for the stabbing death of a man during a botched robbery in 2002. It is just the second time the Republican governor has granted clemency during his nearly seven years in office.\n \n\n   \n  “After a thorough review of the facts and prayerful consideration, I have chosen to accept the Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation to commute Tremane Wood’s sentence to life without parole,” Stitt announced.\n \n\n   \n  “This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,” the governor said.\n \n\n   \n  In his executive order commuting Wood’s sentence, Stitt says Wood shall not be eligible to apply for or be considered for a commutation, pardon or parole for the rest of his life.\n \n\n   \n  Stitt previously granted clemency to  death row inmate Julius Jones  in 2021, but had rejected clemency recommendations in four other cases. A total of 16 men have been executed during Stitt’s time in office.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond expressed disappointment with the governor’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I am disappointed that the governor has granted clemency for this dangerous murderer, but respect that this was his decision to make,” Drummond said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Wood was scheduled to die for his role in the killing of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farmworker from Montana, during an attempted robbery at a north Oklahoma City hotel early on New Year’s Day in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves, said she and her legal team are “profoundly grateful” for Stitt’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace,” her statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Wipf grew up in a Hutterite religious community in Montana, and his family and the surviving victim of the attack supported his clemency, Castro Alves said.\n \n\n   \n  George Burnett, one of the original prosecutors, said he’s concerned that a five-member parole board can have such a profound impact on a case that has been litigated for more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  “Ronnie Wipf is buried on a lonely hill somewhere on the plains of Montana, and when his family visits him, they wonder what might have been,” Burnett said.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma’s Pardon and Parole Board  voted 3-2 last week  to recommend that the governor grant clemency.\n \n\n   \n  During the clemency hearing, Wood’s attorneys didn’t deny that he participated in the robbery but maintained that his brother, Zjaiton Wood, was the one who actually stabbed Wipf. Zjaiton Wood was sentenced to life without parole. Before he died in prison in 2019, he admitted to several people that he killed Wipf, said Tremane Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves.\n \n\n   \n  Castro Alves told the panel Tremane Wood had an ineffective trial attorney who was drinking heavily at the time and who did little work on the case. She also said trial prosecutors improperly concealed from jurors the benefits that witnesses received in exchange for their testimony. Wood’s attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution on these grounds, but were denied.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors painted Wood as a dangerous criminal who continued to participate in gang activity and commit crimes while in prison, including buying and selling drugs, using contraband cellphones and ordering attacks on other inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Wood, who testified to the panel via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, accepted responsibility for his prison misconduct and his participation in the robbery, but denied being the one who killed Wipf.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a monster. I’m not a killer. I never was and I never have been,” Wood said.\n \n\n   \n  Wood’s attorneys also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution, but the court denied that request early Thursday. His attorneys had argued, among other things, that trial prosecutors didn’t properly reveal details of a plea agreement with a key witness.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:59:00-05:00","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that the ongoing government shutdown in the US has significantly disrupted air travel, with over 11,000 flights canceled since the FAA issued an emergency order to reduce flights from 40 of the busiest US airports.

trouble for Zelensky as Ukrainians face another winter of power cuts \n       \n  Analysis by Andrew Carey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:05 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When  Vladimir Putin  first started targeting the Ukrainian energy sector, it did not have the impact the Kremlin wanted. Ukraine’s ability to withstand the  Russian campaign , and carefully ration its power supplies, served only to cement its leader Volodymyr Zelensky’s credibility at home.\n \n\n   \n  Three years on, the picture is rather more difficult. Ukraine’s president finds himself under fire over a burgeoning energy sector corruption scandal, while his people face a fourth tough winter, with power cuts and heating outages as severe as ever.\n \n\n   \n  On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces find themselves losing ground across the east, most critically in the one-time  logistics hub of Pokrovsk , as key Western allies appear to be focused elsewhere. The war may still be Ukraine’s overriding priority, but corruption is likely Zelensky’s most immediate concern.\n \n\n   \n  The scandal, which centers on alleged kickbacks from contractors including those working to protect critical energy infrastructure, has already taken down two of Zelensky’s ministers and embroiled a former business associate from his days in the entertainment industry.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the government announced it was suspending German Galushchenko, the justice minister, who previously served as energy minister. Galushchenko said he would defend himself in the face of the allegations. Both he and his successor as energy minister have since submitted their resignations at Zelensky’s urging; swift parliamentary approval is expected.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Ukraine’s anti-corruption body announced it had carried out searches on dozens of properties – including one linked to Galushchenko – as part of an investigation into the alleged kickbacks.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said about $100 million had been siphoned off – between 10-15% of the value of the contracts – as state-owned businesses including Energoatom, which operates Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, paid companies for work done to enhance security at key sites.\n \n\n   \n  That the latest corruption scandal involves the energy sector gives it a particular edge. People in Kyiv are currently without electricity for eight to 11 hours per day, a result of Russia’s improved ability to strike  power plants and substations .\n \n\n   \n  Diesel generators, purchased during the first blackouts three years ago, have reappeared outside shops and cafes. Candlelit dinners have again become part of the daily routine.\n \n\n   \n  The blackouts can also mean heating is off, lifts in high-rise buildings do not work, and water supply is interrupted. The situation is usually worse in towns and cities outside the capital.\n \n\n   \n     Zelensky name-checked in court \n \n\n   \n  Court hearings on the investigation – live streamed on the public broadcaster’s website – have been underway in Kyiv since Tuesday and look set to continue for at least the next few days. They include snippets of what investigators say are 1,000 hours of recorded conversations between the suspects in the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a potentially damaging first, one of the conversations released Wednesday name-checked Zelensky himself. In a transcript read out in court, the man accused of masterminding the corruption scheme, Timur Mindich, appeared to suggest he had influence over the president, boasting to Galushchenko of his success in getting Zelensky to call the then-energy minister on the phone and invite him for a meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript contained no details of that alleged call, and Zelensky has made no comment. It is believed to be the first time his name has been mentioned, albeit indirectly, in a corruption case in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is Mindich himself, perhaps the most awkward element in all this as far as Ukraine’s leader is concerned.\n \n\n   \n  Given the codename Carlson by his alleged co-conspirators, Mindich is a former business partner of Zelensky, dating back to his previous career as a highly successful entertainer and producer.\n \n\n   \n  Mindich himself has made no comment on the accusations against him and has left the country, Ukraine’s state border agency said in a statement late Wednesday. The agency noted he had left legally, adding they had not received an order to stop him. Zelensky’s cabinet has now introduced sanctions on Mindich, which include a block on his business interests and bank accounts.\n \n\n   \n     Defeating Russia and tackling corruption \n \n\n   \n  Corruption allegations are nothing new in Ukraine. During the first months of Moscow’s full scale invasion, there was an unwritten understanding among Ukraine’s journalists and civil society that corruption investigations were not a priority. Defeating Russia was the only thing that mattered.\n \n\n   \n  That consensus began to decay after about a year. Since 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) has opened investigations into a series of scandals, including an illegal land development project involving a deputy prime minister and the embezzlement of public funds allocated to pay for soldiers’ food.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Zelensky has managed to avoid getting dragged into the scandals, though Ukrainians put him on notice in the summer with large anti-government protests – the biggest since the full scale invasion – after he approved a parliamentary move to neuter NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office. He backed down under pressure from key international allies, who have made anti-corruption an important plank of their long-term support for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister under Zelensky and now head of the Kyiv School of Economics, told CNN the president had to “act as harshly as possible” if he wanted to maintain popular support among Ukrainians. “(People) say, ‘Let’s see how he acts… if he’s not acting, then he’s with them (the accused). We’ll know if he’s acting… but if he really sanctions them, arrests them, prosecutes those who allow this to happen, then, okay, he’s good.’”\n \n\n   \n  Until Tuesday, Mylovanov was a member of the supervisory board of Energoatom, before resigning his position over what he said was the failure of company executives to act rapidly on the scandal, though he blamed the foot-dragging on cluelessness rather than corruption.\n \n\n   \n  It is too soon to assess whether this corruption scandal will cause any lasting  damage to Zelensky’s support among Ukrainians. Recent polling conducted by  the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, albeit before the latest allegations, shows popular levels of trust in the Ukrainian leader remaining at around 60% – down on the figures for earlier this year, but consistent with the levels enjoyed in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Tolerance of corruption has declined over the same period, though not dramatically.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hunder, who leads the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, said it was essential that those who were stealing from the state were held fully accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a critical moment for Ukraine’s leadership to show that its commitment to integrity and accountability is unwavering,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mylovanov took a more pessimistic view of how the corruption scandal would likely play with the Trump administration, regardless of how Zelensky acts.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if they care or not,” he said. “But they will use it as a leverage point over Zelensky.”\n \n\n   \n   Victoria Butenko and Svitlana Vlasova contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/27/entertainment/sean-combs-release-date-2028","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00-05:00","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ prison release date set for 2028","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, a prominent music executive and celebrity, was convicted on two counts of transporting women to engage in prostitution in a federal trial, resulting in a 50-month prison sentence.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sean “Diddy” Combs will be staying in prison at least one month longer than he thought.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Prisons pushed Combs’ release date to June 4, 2028, according to the agency’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ original release date – first reported in October, more than three months after a jury delivered a mixed verdict in his federal trial – had been scheduled for May 8, 2028.\n \n\n   \n  No explanation was given by the Bureau of Prisons for the pushed back date  and representatives couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The change could reflect an updated calculation or punishment if an infraction, if any, occurred.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ spokesman Juda Engelmayer told CNN they have not been given an explanation for the changed date yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still trying to find out what the dates mean and why and what the issue is, if there is one” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs was accepted into the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program, known as RDAP, at the low security prison in Fort Dix, NJ. Inmates who participate in the program often receive credits that can reduce time from their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “His only goal is he wants to work on himself, do better, be better, and get back to his family and be the father that they need. He’s not going to do anything to hurt that,” Engelmayer said.\n \n\n   \n  Combs had been sentenced to 50 months (roughly more than four years) by a judge after a two-month trial ended with him being convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs was acquitted by a jury of the more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering for which he was facing decades and possibly life in prison if convicted.\n \n\n   \n  He has already served 13 months in jail and that will be credited to his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  He had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest. In late  October , Combs was transferred on Thursday to  Fort Dix , a low-security federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Combs is appealing his conviction and sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ defense previously told CNN that they had approached President Donald Trump’s administration about a potential pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Combs’ attorney Nicole Westmoreland  told CNN  in August that it was her “understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon.” At the time, a White House official told CNN they “will not comment on the existence or nonexistence of any clemency request.”\n \n\n   \n  In October after Combs’ sentencing, Trump confirmed that Combs had requested a presidential pardon in connection with his federal criminal case,  telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins  “a lot of people have asked me for pardons,” including Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had previously indicated that he was unlikely to pardon Combs during an  interview  with Newsmax, saying, “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile.” Trump said that this made pardoning Combs “more difficult to do.”\n \n\n   \n  During his trial, Combs’ defense admitted to his pattern of violent behavior against women with whom he was in romantic relationships over the years. The jury was repeatedly shown footage — first published in 2024 by CNN — of Combs violently beating his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway back in 2016. The jury was also shown images of bloody gashes and bruises on Ventura’s body during trial.\n \n\n   \n  Ventura was the star witness of the case and testified that she was repeatedly abused by Combs and forced to take drugs and have sex with other men against her will throughout their 10-year relationship, during which he controlled her career and finances. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” also recounted psychological, financial and physical abuse by Combs who she said forced her to have sex with other men while she was under the influence of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  At his sentencing, judge Arun Submaranian  admonished Combs  for his abuse and rejected the defense’s “attempt to characterize what happened here as merely intimate consensual experiences or just a sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll story.” Submaranian said that the prosecution’s case “showed that (Combs) abused the power and control (he) had over the women (he) professed to love dearly.”\n \n\n   \n  “You abused them physically, emotionally and psychologically and you used that abuse to get your way,” he said, addressing Combs. “This was subjugation, and it drove both Ms. Ventura and Jane to thoughts of ending their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs is also facing roughly 70 civil lawsuits where most of the dozens of accusers — some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged incidents — claim they were drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs has denied all of the civil claims. Some of the lawsuits have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.

But with an aging population and the rise in conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, the need will only grow.\n \n\n   \n  Dialysis can keep a person with end-stage kidney disease alive, but the process can be hard on the body and  can typically  sustain someone for only about five years, on average.\n \n\n   \n  In the search for an alternative, scientists have been turning to cross-species organ transplants, called xenotransplantation.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest hurdles they have to overcome is the body’s tendency to reject an organ transplant. New studies published Thursday in the journal Nature offer more information on how to prevent the body from rejecting the pig kidney, and the researchers say they think they’ve had a breakthrough in understanding how the immune system handles these kinds of transplants.\n \n\n   \n    The rejection issue\n \n\n   \n  The human immune system protects the body from threats like fungus or bacteria, but it can sometimes be a little overprotective.\n \n\n   \n  The immune system cannot distinguish between a bad foreign object that enters the body, like a virus, and a good one, like a donor organ. When either is introduced, the immune system goes into full protection mode, sending antibodies to attack whatever it identifies as the problem. Those antibodies can damage the donor organ and ultimately make a transplant fail.\n \n\n   \n  Even with human-to-human transplants, rejection is a big concern. For the rest of their lives, recipients must take powerful anti-rejection drugs that suppress the immune system. When the donor is a pig, scientists also genetically alter the organ to make it more compatible with the human body.\n \n\n   \n  The new studies aimed to take the closest look possible at how the human body rejects a pig organ.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at NYU transplanted an organ from a genetically modified pig into a person who was brain-dead: Maurice Miller, 57, who died from a mass in his brain in July 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors said Miller had always wanted to donate his organs but could not do so because he had cancer. Instead, they asked Miller’s family if they would donate his entire body to research.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers thought an organ transplant into a brain-dead person would allow them to test tissue samples and blood in ways that would be too intrusive with a living recipient or even with a non-human primate, said study co-author Dr. Robert Montgomery, chief of the New York University Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “This decedent might be the most highly studied human in history,” Montgomery said of Miller.\n \n\n   \n  The doctors removed Miller’s own kidneys and transplanted a genetically modified kidney from a specially bred pig from the biotech company Revivicor. Miller’s body was kept alive on a ventilator in the ICU for two months. During that time, doctors biopsied the kidney regularly, monitored his blood and tested other tissue samples.\n \n\n   \n  There were two episodes in which Miller’s body tried to reject the pig kidney, but for the first time in history of xenotransplantation, Montgomery said, they had success with   available rejection medication, and the organ continued to function. They stopped the experiment at day 61.\n \n\n   \n  This part of the work, Montgomery explained, would help doctors better understand what immunosuppressive medications would work best in other people who receive pig organs.\n \n\n   \n  “It also will give us a sense of relief moving forward in the clinical trials that we’re in the middle of right now, to know that when you put a pig kidney in a human, from a physiological standpoint, it just does its thing,” Montgomery said. “The kidney is capable of doing most of the things that a human kidney can do, and the things that it doesn’t, we either have redundancy and we don’t necessarily need it, or there’s a few drugs that we need to supplement. But other than that, we’re good to go.”\n \n\n   \n  The new research, he said, “brings us measurably closer to safe pig-to-human organ transplants.”\n \n\n   \n    Creating a detailed map\n \n\n   \n  During the episodes in which Miller’s body started to reject the organ, the doctors were able to create a detailed map of exactly how his immune system reacted to the pig organ and identify the pathways the body was using to reject it. They also were able to map out the genomics associated with those pathways, mapping 5,100 expressed pig and human genes and pinpointing every immune cell in the body to track immune behavior at this uniquely granular level.\n \n\n   \n  “We really were able to tease apart what happened on a nearly daily basis,” said study co-author Dr Brendan Keating, a member of the faculty in the Department of Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the NYU Langone Transplant Institute.\n \n\n   \n  They could also see   the differences in immune reaction to a pig organ versus what happens with a transplanted human organ.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers said they identified biomarkers in the blood that eventually may be used to detect organ rejection much earlier, before damage could be done.\n \n\n   \n  Although the study is a major step forward, Montgomery said, it involved just one person, so the findings will need to be replicated in others to see whether the reactions are consistent. The researchers just got funding to test immune suppression techniques in 20 additional patients, he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We’re getting better at this’\n \n\n   \n  In the past year alone, scientist have made enormous progress in understanding how pig kidney transplants work.\n \n\n   \n  The most notable success involved the case of Tim Andrews of New Hampshire, the fourth living person in the US to get a kidney from a genetically modified pig.\n \n\n   \n  Andrews set a record when his pig kidney continued to function ﻿for 271 days.  Doctors had to remove  the organ at the end of October, after they noticed a decline in function. But before that point, the transplant had worked so well that Andrews was able to take long walks and even throw out the first pitch at a Boston Red Sox game.\n \n\n   \n  The kind of research found in the new studies is important for the field, said Dr. Minnie Sarwal, co-director of the Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program at the University of California San Francisco.   \n \n\n   \n  “Sixty-one days of stable renal function is novel proof of concept, and I think it confirms that genetically engineered pig kidneys can sustain physiological function in human circulation,” said Sarwal, who was not involved with the new research. “As a first step, proof of concept, clearly, is very important, because it is bridging the gap between what we were previously worked working on with short lived preclinical models, and we are able to go to true clinical feasibility, even though it’s obviously not long-term. But 61 days is better than, let’s say, hours, or maybe a few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Sarwal, who focuses on therapeutic innovations for immunosuppression drug design, said the new studies also demonstrated that rejection was treatable.\n \n\n   \n  “That part’s not groundbreaking, but I think it’s very comforting that our current treatments would work in that model, which we expected they would, but confirmation is great to see,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Mapping immune reaction may give researchers other “druggable molecular checkpoints” so they can develop better immunosuppression options for transplant recipients, Sarwal said.\n \n\n   \n  Montgomery thinks his experiment can also give hope that xenotransplantation will be a more viable option someday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting better and better at this, and I think that’s the message that I would like to deliver,” Montgomery said. “There’s going to be ups and downs. Nothing worth doing isn’t fraught with some complications.”\n \n\n   \n  But, he added, “it’s all solveable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/uk/andrew-mountbatten-windsor-epstein-files-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:01:00.000-05:00","title":"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor Tells Epstein: 'I Can’t Take Any More of This' in Newly Released Emails","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate show that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Duke of York, expressed distress in 2011 when informed that a British newspaper was planning to publish allegations claiming he had sexual encounters with underage girls at Epstein’s properties.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:01 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate have once again raised questions over  Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor ’s account of his friendship with the late sex offender and his denials of the allegations of his accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The former prince told Epstein and convicted child sex trafficker  Ghislaine Maxwell  “I can’t take any more of this” when informed 14 years ago that a British newspaper was going to publish a story about the trio.\n \n\n   \n  A fresh tranche of documents provided by Epstein’s estate, some of which also  mentioned US President Donald Trump , was released by the  US House Oversight Committee  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the thousands of documents was the email conversation from March 2011 in which Andrew repeatedly pleaded with the couple to make it clear that he had no involvement in the alleged activities.\n \n\n   \n  “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” Andrew wrote to Epstein. “I can’t take any more of this my end.”\n \n\n   \n  The messages were sent months after Andrew claimed to have severed all ties with the convicted pedophile in December 2010.  CNN has reached out to Andrew for comment following the latest release of material from the House committee.\n \n\n   \n  In what appears to be a separate email chain between the former Duke of York and Maxwell on the same day, discussing a response to the press enquiry from the Mail on Sunday newspaper, he wrote: “Hey there! What’s all this? I don’t know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can’t take any more of this.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew sent his messages after he was forwarded a right-to-reply email by Epstein from the newspaper, in which, he featured in several claims. The email alleged that a woman, whose name has been redacted in the released documents, worked as a masseuse for Epstein and met and had sex with Andrew at Maxwell’s London home in 2001.\n \n\n   \n  It alleged that the masseuse met Andrew again at Epstein’s New York residence where she and another girl were directed by Maxwell to sit on his knee, and he groped them before Maxwell directed the girls to have sex with him.\n \n\n   \n  It also alleged that the woman was later directed to stage an orgy for Andrew and Epstein on the financier’s private Caribbean island, Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  The emails appear to be referring to the claims of Virginia Giuffre, who has spoken extensively about her years of being sexually trafficked, allegedly at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein who  died by suicide  in April, repeatedly claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew while underage on three occasions – in London, New York and on Little St. James.\n \n\n   \n  She alleged that third encounter was “an orgy” on Epstein’s island with the financier and “approximately eight other girls” who “appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English,” as detailed in her posthumous memoir.\n \n\n   \n  She claimed that the-then prince  was aware  she was underage in the US when they were introduced.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” Andrew told the BBC in a television interview in 2019.  He said in the same sit-down that visiting Epstein in 2010  was the “wrong decision”  and that he regretted acting in a manner that was “unbecoming.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein confirms Andrew photo\n \n\n   \n  In another email exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein also appeared to discuss Giuffre and the now infamous photograph of Andrew with his arm around the then-17-year-old. The now former royal has repeatedly said that he has  no recollection of the photograph  being taken and has suggested the image could be fake.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The disgraced financier also appeared to ask the journalist to investigate Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  “I never misled you, this girl is a total liar,” Epstein wrote in the email.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe your paper should jump on and show that (redacted)’s allegations re andrew (sic) are the same, she also accused numnerous (sic) people of having sex with her,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew reached an  out-of-court settlement  with Giuffre in 2022 after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, after  Giuffre’s memoir  reignited public attention on Andrew’s links to Epstein, he was officially  stripped of his titles  in an extraordinary move by his brother, King Charles III.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee  requested Andrew answer questions  as part of the panel’s investigation into Epstein and his accomplices. Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC that he has not responded yet to the committee’s invitation to testify.\n \n\n   \n    Mandelson in contact with Epstein until 2016, emails show\n \n\n   \n  The new cache of documents from the House committee also seem to shed further light on the extent of the contact between Epstein and Peter Mandelson, who was  recently fired  as British ambassador to the United States over his ties to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Emails show that the pair were in contact as late as 2016 when Mandelson appeared to reference Epstein’s birthday two weeks earlier. “63 years old. You made it,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Their exchange also appears to suggest that Mandelson had cautioned Epstein to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, with the disgraced financier writing that “you were right about staying away from Andrew.”\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson responds, “Yes, without Andrew it would not have gone nuclear.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear exactly what the two men are referring to. CNN has attempted to reach out to Mandelson for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson was fired as Britain’s ambassador to the US in September after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between him and Epstein which revealed the depth of their friendship.\n \n\n   \n  Those emails had shown that Mandelson had sent Epstein messages of support until 2010 – even after the sex offender was convicted of soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida two years prior.\n \n\n   \n  Mandelson’s ties to Epstein were known prior to his appointment to the post in Washington in 2024. But the September emails sparked a crisis for Britain’s Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with many questioning why he appointed Mandelson despite concerns about his past.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Foreign Office told CNN at the time that the emails showed that “the depth and extent” of the now-ex-ambassador’s relationship with Epstein is “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”\n \n\n   \n  Following his dismissal two months ago, Mandelson said in a letter to embassy staff reported by the BBC that he continued “to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/george-conway-us-house-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:26:00-04:00","title":"George Conway, a prominent Trump critic, may jump into New York congressional race, source tells CNN","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"George Conway, a prominent critic of Donald Trump and former conservative legal figure, is considering a run for the Democratic primary in New York’s 12th Congressional District, a seat currently held by Rep.

The loss of these benefits forces too many seniors to choose between buying food, medication, and paying rent.

Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history ended Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. Staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports will be frozen at 6%, the Department of Transportation said Wednesday night, stopping short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers are now showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain at that level until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA safety team is encouraged to see our air traffic control staffing surge, and they feel comfortable with pausing the reduction schedule to give us time to review the airspace,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “If the FAA safety team determines the trend lines are moving in the right direction, we’ll put forward a path to resume normal operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said Tuesday that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would allow airlines to restore operations before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  But that will take some time.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in an earlier statement.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a statement Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week if the government reopens quickly. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/holiday-travel-spirit-airlines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Flying Will Stay Rough After the Shutdown.

Why? Spirit Airlines \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Relatively few people fly Spirit Airlines – but the company could still affect how much you pay for your holiday travel, even if recent government-mandated flight cancellations end.\n \n\n   \n  For years, Spirit has had an outsized effect on fares across the industry. The discount carrier’s rock-bottom fares forced much larger carriers, such as American, Delta and United Airlines, to keep their prices lower. That includes offering lower-priced seats at the back of planes, often on the same no-frills basis as Spirit.\n \n\n   \n  But Spirit, facing severe financial hardship, is now a fraction of the size it was just a year ago. That is impacting fares this holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  Even if flight cancellations because of the government shutdown are restored, there will be nearly 11,000 fewer Spirit flights this holiday season compared to last year, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium analyzed by CNN. That includes the period six days before Thanksgiving through the Sunday after New Year’s Day. The drop represents a one-third reduction in Spirit’s schedule, or a loss of nearly 2 million available seats.\n \n\n   \n  US domestic flights are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site Going.com.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I can’t pinpoint that and say all of that is attributable to Spirit,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for Going.com. “But it definitely is contributing to the higher prices we’re seeing.”\n \n\n   \n  Like most other low-cost carriers, Spirit has continually lost money since 2020, when the pandemic hit. Now in the midst of its  second bankruptcy reorganization,  the company once again warned investors on Tuesday there was “ substantial doubt ” over its ability to stay in business over the next 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Spirit is shuttering immediately. But the airline has been slashing flights in a desperate effort to stem losses, offering far fewer routes.\n \n\n   \n  The routes of virtually every US airline now have less overlap with Spirit than before, Raymond James airlines analyst Savanthi Syth said in a note to clients this week.   And with Spirit flying on fewer routes, the carrier won’t put nearly as much downward pressure on the fares of larger airlines.\n \n\n   \n  In August, when Spirit  first warned investors  about possibly being forced out of business, Spirit CEO Dave Davis told   employees the airline remained “critical” for flyers.\n \n\n   \n  “We have saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, whether they fly with us or not,” he wrote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/middleeast/west-bank-settler-violence-arson-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:39:00-05:00","title":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launched a violent arson attack in the West Bank, specifically targeting the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory in Beit Lid, east of Tulkarm, damaging property and injuring civilians.

attack on an agricultural area in the occupied West Bank Tuesday evening, according to Palestinian activists in the area, marking the latest such attack in what has been a surge of  settler violence .\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in the town of Beit Lid east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory, videos show and residents told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women heard shouting in the background, and men carrying extinguishers and water buckets scrambling to put out the fires.\n \n\n   \n  Videos show torched trucks, tents and metal sheds, and smashed car windows.\n \n\n   \n  Residents said Palestinian civil defense and firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour after the fires started.\n \n\n   \n  Another video filmed by a Palestinian resident shows the settlers coming down a hill toward the Bedouin village.\n \n\n   \n  This attack is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which have been taking place on a near-daily basis since mid-October. A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian economy ministry on Wednesday called on the international community to take action to stop the attacks. In Tuesday’s incident, perpetrators set fire to four trucks loaded with products from Al-Juneidi, and smashed windows and other property, it said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Anarchist fringe youth’\n \n\n   \n  A senior official from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) condemned the violence. “The reality in which anarchist fringe youth act violently against innocent civilians and against security forces is unacceptable and is extremely serious,” Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth said in a statement shared by the IDF on Wednesday. “It must be dealt with firmly.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued it was unacceptable for “lawbreakers” to “harm property and innocent civilians” while diverting the IDF’s focus “away from its mission of security and counterterrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/homes/portable-mortgages-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-05:30","title":"The Trump administration is ‘actively evaluating’ portable mortgages.

What you need to know \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has another idea to make housing more affordable: Let homeowners   take their mortgage rate with them when they move.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating” so-called portable mortgages. The proposal aims to address the housing market’s lack of supply.\n \n\n   \n  The administration   stepped up efforts to address housing affordability this past week. Pulte – who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-backed entities that guarantee more than half of US mortgages – said officials are also weighing  how to make mortgages assumable  and whether to introduce  a new 50-year mortgage option .\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%,  according  to a Redfin analysis of FHFA data. However, average mortgage rates have remained stubbornly stuck between 6% and 7% for the last few years. Homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates have been less willing to move and potentially pay hundreds more in interest each month on new mortgages at current rates.\n \n\n   \n  Allowing people to keep their lower mortgage rates could encourage them to move and free up supply. But there are questions about how that would work and whether it might wind up actually raising mortgage rates overall, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by CNN, the FHFA did not provide further details about its plans for portable mortgages. In a statement, a spokesperson said the agency was studying a “wide variety of options” to lower housing costs.\n \n\n   \n    How do portable mortgages work?\n \n\n   \n  A portable mortgage allows a borrower to transfer their existing mortgage and mortgage rate to a new property when they move, instead of taking out a brand-new loan.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, imagine a homeowner selling their house for $400,000 with half of that paid off on a 3% mortgage. With a portable mortgage, they could sell their home and transfer the $200,000 left on the loan to the new house, keeping the 3% rate.\n \n\n   \n  Things get trickier if the new home is more expensive. If it costs $450,000, for example, the buyer would need to cover the extra $50,000 either in cash or through a second, smaller loan likely issued at the current higher interest rate.\n \n\n   \n  The hope is that if homeowners could move without losing their low rates, more homes would go up for sale, giving buyers who’ve been locked out a better shot, Wachter said. But the effects on supply would likely be limited, and it might take Congress passing a law to iron out legal wrinkles.\n \n\n   \n    Might this backfire?\n \n\n   \n  Portable mortgages could disrupt the engine powering the US housing market: mortgage-backed securities. Those are essentially bundles of mortgages that banks or lenders sell to investors, which gives the banks the cash they need to issue new loans and keep the mortgage market flowing.\n \n\n   \n  If homeowners can take their loans with them when they move, fewer loans will be paid off early – which means more risk for investors, who might demand higher interest rates to compensate, Wachter said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, mortgage agreements are clear contracts tied to a specific property, with the home’s address listed as collateral. Transferring that loan to a new house would mean effectively rewriting the contract.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s too early to tell what’s going to happen, but it’s going to be a logistical nightmare,” said Justin Demola, the president of Lenders One, a national alliance of mortgage bankers. “All mortgages have a property address, a legal description. How do you get around that as you’re taking the mortgage to the next property?”\n \n\n   \n    What else is the administration considering?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is also looking into a 50-year mortgage, but the proposal  has drawn backlash  from some housing experts. They argue that the monthly savings would be minimal compared to the significantly higher interest costs over the loan’s life versus a standard 30-year fixed mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  The administration also brought up potentially allowing more assumable loans, meaning homebuyers can take over a seller’s existing mortgage and mortgage rate. Most government-backed loans, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration, are already assumable. In fact, there are companies that help buyers find homes with assumable mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  However, Demola said he doesn’t see many first-time homebuyers assuming other people’s mortgages, since doing so typically requires a large cash payment or a second mortgage to buy out the existing loan.\n \n\n   \n  “Loans have been assumable forever. You don’t really see many being assumed right now,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/nfl-week-11-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-09:30","title":"5 Things to Watch in the NFL’s Week 11: Spain Debut, Revenge, and MVP Dreams","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NFL’s Week 11 slate features a historic expansion with the first regular-season game in Spain, where the Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders play at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.

and a massive Sunday night clash. Here are the 5 things to watch in the NFL’s Week 11 \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:30 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The NFL’s passport is getting another stamp, but the drama back home is just as intense.\n \n\n   \n   From revenge games to division battles, here are five things to know heading into Week 11.\n \n\n   \n    NFL heads to Spain\n \n\n   \n  For the first time ever, the NFL is headed to the Spanish capital.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders will square off in Madrid in the league’s first regular-season game in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The historic matchup will take place at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, home of Real Madrid, and will close out this year’s international slate. Spain becomes the seventh country outside the United States to host an NFL regular-season game, joining Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil and Ireland.\n \n\n   \n  So set those alarms early on Sunday – kickoff from Madrid is at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n    Falcons out for revenge\n \n\n   \n  The Atlanta Falcons will have extra motivation Sunday when they host the Carolina Panthers. The last time these two met in Week 3, Carolina rolled to a 30-0 win.\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta has dropped four straight and sits at 3-6. The offense has been brutal, converting just three third downs in its last three games – 3 for 29 in that span. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will need to steady the ship if the Falcons hope to stop the slide.\n \n\n   \n  The good news? Their next three opponents – Panthers, Saints and Jets – are all beatable.\n \n\n   \n    Stafford’s MVP case\n \n\n   \n  Matthew Stafford is on a tear. The Los Angeles Rams quarterback is rewriting the record book, becoming the first in NFL history to throw 20 touchdown passes without an interception over a six-game stretch.\n \n\n   \n  In his last three outings alone, Stafford has tossed 13 touchdowns. He’s now tied with New England’s Drake Maye as a favorite for league MVP.\n \n\n   \n  Another milestone: By beating the 49ers last week, Stafford’s career record finally hit .500 at 115-115-1. After all those rough years in Detroit, that’s no small feat. A win Sunday against the 7-2 Seahawks would give him a winning record for the first time – and first place in the NFC West.\n \n\n   \n     More Mile High Magic? \n \n\n   \n  Every week, the Denver Broncos seem to pull another rabbit out of the hat.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payton’s team has punted more than any team in the league, yet they have won a league-high seven straight and sits atop the AFC West at 8-2.\n \n\n   \n  During this streak, Denver’s margin for error has been razor-thin – wins by 4, 3 (twice), 2 and 1 point.\n \n\n   \n  At some point, the one-score magic runs out… or maybe this team just has it.\n \n\n   \n  But this week’s test is different: Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs visit Mile High. The Chiefs are coming off a bye and a loss to Buffalo. History says that’s bad news for Denver – Andy Reid is 22-4 after a bye week.\n \n\n   \n    Lions vs. Eagles in a mega showdown\n \n\n   \n  Sunday Night Football brings a heavyweight NFC clash as the Philadelphia Eagles host the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  The defending champs are 7-2, but their fans still feel disrespected. When the stage is big, the Eagles usually deliver – since 2021, they’ve won 10 straight against the Lions, Rams and Packers.\n \n\n   \n  Lions head coach Dan Campbell recently took over play-calling duties, and it paid off immediately with 44 points on Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The Eagles’ defense, though, is a much tougher test. This one could easily be a preview of the NFC Championship Game.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/government-shutdown-ends-federal-workers-return","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:16:00-04:00","title":"The government shutdown is over, but things are not back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government shutdown has ended, but its effects remain deeply entrenched, with federal workers facing prolonged backlogs, unpaid wages, and operational chaos.

Tami Luhby, Sunlen Serfaty, René Marsh, Alexandra Skores, Ella Nilsen, Marshall Cohen, Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:16 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is over. But hundreds of thousands of federal workers   are coming back after 43 days to anything but normalcy, employees from across the country told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Flight delays and cancellations will linger as Air Traffic Controllers staff back up. Workers who haven’t received a paycheck in weeks will still have to wait for back pay. Research grants will be delayed. Economic reports are likely to be scrapped. Six weeks of email and voicemails will have to be waded through.\n \n\n   \n  And in three months, they may have to contend with turbulence all over again: The agreement President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through January.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does it kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers said that the shutdown has been an exclamation point on top of months of chaos as the Trump administration has slashed jobs and, in some cases, entire agencies since the president   took office in January. The administration  sought to fire  more federal workers when the shutdown hit, but the short-term funding deal halted those dismissals until the end of January.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be stressful for everybody,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee. “We can only begin to imagine how difficult it’s going to be get everything functioning again, especially since we were already limping along in a lot of ways before the shutdown happened.”\n \n\n   \n  For the American public, the lingering effects of the shutdown could be felt for months or even years to come at the nation’s airports. Meanwhile, those receiving government assistance like food stamps are eagerly awaiting the government to finally get funds out the door.\n \n\n   \n    A slew of backlogs\n \n\n   \n  Federal workers back on the clock Thursday will need to assess how to address more than six weeks of   backlogs. Federal employees not deemed essential were furloughed throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  From food safety and NASA to education and the national parks, federal workforces were already short-staffed following widespread cuts from DOGE earlier this year, which employees told CNN will make it even harder to dig out from the under the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is going to look very different than in 2019 (after the last government shutdown) when these offices were fully staffed,” said an Education Department employee.\n \n\n   \n  A second Education employee told CNN that they were told only check   their emails at approved times to look   for “reduction in force” layoff notices — and to make sure their computers didn’t lock down after 30 days.\n \n\n   \n  It was “heart wrenching” to see the emails piling up, the person said, including with desperate pleas from parents of disabled children who filed discrimination cases with the department’s Office for Civil Rights. Another Education official estimated that, during the shutdown, there were more than 2,000 complaints filed with the office, which handles allegations of discrimination against students with disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  It will take days to get labs used to test food and prevent food-borne illnesses at the Food and Drug Administration back to full capacity at the agency’s testing labs, said one worker at the agency’s   Human Foods Program.\n \n\n   \n  Besides having to catch up on equipment maintenance and quality checks, “it will take time to restart research along with broader policy planning,” the worker said.\n \n\n   \n  And at the Internal Revenue Service, backlogs in tax filings from those who filed for extensions will take “two to three months to catch up,” said Gibson Jones, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 98 in Memphis. “You’re talking about more than 40 days of mail that no one touched. People who are expecting money back will also see a delay in processing those tax refunds.”\n \n\n   \n  A big focus at the National Park Service will be assessing any damage that occurred to parks during the shutdown, said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n \n\n   \n  Many parks had law enforcement staffing during the shutdown, but there have been reports of graffiti and off-road vehicle damage in parks like Arches and Glen Canyon, as well as reports of illegal activities like base-jumping and flying drones in Yosemite, Brengel said.   But there was a surge of volunteer support during the shutdown, she said, and many parks paid for custodial services like garbage removal with fee money — or volunteer groups stepped in to help.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, many parks didn’t get damaged,” Brengel said. “But this is unsustainable and everyone knows it.”\n \n\n   \n  At NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland - home of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes -  employees were alarmed as more than a dozen buildings on the campus were emptied and padlocked, with very little notice given,  CNN recently reported .\n \n\n   \n  Some of the sources CNN recently spoke to said they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by the Trump administration to quietly gut the Goddard campus during the shutdown — a claim a NASA spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be many people who have no idea that this facility closure situation is going on,” a NASA   engineer said. “I expect that will be a pretty crazy situation on top of just coming back.”\n \n\n   \n    When will employees receive back pay?\n \n\n   \n  When the  roughly 1.4 million federal workers  who have been furloughed or working without pay will receive their back pay may vary by agency. Many have  missed  two full paychecks and a partial one during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, it only took a few   business days for workers to   be paid, said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees. But she was concerned that this year it could take longer because many human resources staffers at agencies were furloughed or have left   amid the administration’s downsizing efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the complexity is that federal workers are not all paid at the same time since the government uses multiple pay systems, said Stier of Partnership for Public Service.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a huge undertaking on top of a lot of other things that the federal employees are going to have to be doing,” he said, though it should take a matter of days, not weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But   “until we get paid, everyone’s going to still have those same financial stressors on them,” said Ben   Emmel, who represents 2,400 Government Accountability Office employees as president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.\n \n\n   \n    Effects on air travel could linger for years\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown brought chaos to US airports, and the impact   could linger well beyond  the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more   coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters this week, while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n   In May,   the Department of Transportation said   it would replace the decades-old Federal Aviation Administration infrastructure with a new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.\n \n\n   \n  At a Wednesday press conference at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Duffy said the software and upgrades the new system requires “would take longer than the three-year period,” originally promised.\n \n\n   \n    When will safety net programs be funded?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown wreaked havoc on the  nation’s safety net programs , most notably food stamps relied upon by nearly  42 million Americans  to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  Just when enrollees in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will receive their  full benefits  for November will depend on where they live. More than a dozen states started issuing full allotments to residents last week before the Supreme Court  paused  a court order requiring full funding for the program. Several other states began sending  partial benefits  last week based on an earlier court order. Other states have not yet distributed any of this month’s aid.\n \n\n   \n  After the government reopens, many states could issue full SNAP benefits within three days, said Lexie Kuznick, director of policy and government relations for the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state, county and city agencies. Some, however, could take up to a week to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The spending agreement signed into law takes the threat of another lapse of SNAP off the table in January when another shutdown could occur: The bill funded several agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, for the entire fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and Head Start could take longer to restart. They are run by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n \n\n   \n  It typically takes at least 30 days for the HHS to calculate states’ allocations and get the money out the door for LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. And he fears it will take even longer this year since  HHS laid off its LIHEAP staff  in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  Federal grants for the roughly 140 Head Start programs – serving more than 65,000 children and families – that were affected by the shutdown could take up to two weeks to distribute, said Tommy Sheridan, deputy director at the National Head Start Association.\n \n\n   \n  The funding lapse forced 20 programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico to close. Other programs have been able to maintain their operations thanks for local and philanthropic support.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the timeline for getting funds to LIHEAP and Head Start programs, an HHS spokesperson said that the agency will “work swiftly” to administer LIHEAP annual awards. Head Start recipients can expect to receive communications that will include a timeline for the release of federal funds.\n \n\n   \n    Economics reports delayed\n \n\n   \n  Economic data released by the government — which is used by business leaders and the Federal Reserve to assess the state of the US economy — has been suspended throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Monthly employment reports for September and October haven’t been released, and neither has the first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  Once the government reopens, statistical agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release updated schedules on data releases.\n \n\n   \n  But this is the first time there have been two delayed jobs reports. And it’s likely that October’s report will never be released, as data for the month was not collected, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period,” Leavitt told reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Headed for the exit?\n \n\n   \n  Caitlin Lewis, who runs  CivicMatch , which connects federal employees with jobs in state or local governments, said the shutdown has pushed many federal workers to the exits.\n \n\n   \n  There was a 74% spike in federal workers signing up for the platform during the first five weeks of the shutdown, she said, compared to the five weeks before the shutdown. Last week was one of the platform’s busiest weeks in months.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, more than 12,000 federal employees have signed up this year.\n \n\n   \n  “People want to stick it out as long as they can.

But right now, the 34-year-old is barely getting by.\n \n\n   \n  Austin is living paycheck to paycheck and saving almost no money, one of the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly unaffordable economy.\n \n\n   \n  Worse, the family-owned construction business he works at is shutting down.\n \n\n   \n  “I am going to be unemployed in the next month or two – with no safety net,” said Austin, who declined to share his last name.\n \n\n   \n  An estimated 24% of US households are living paycheck to paycheck so far in 2025, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis released this week. The bank’s researchers combed through internal data on its tens of millions of consumers and tracked how much income customers spent on necessities like housing, gasoline, groceries, child care and utilities.\n \n\n   \n  They found that 24% of households spend over 95% of their income on those necessities, leaving little to nothing left over for the “nice-to-have” things like going out to dinner or taking a vacation, let alone saving.\n \n\n   \n     No margin for error \n \n\n   \n  Austin, who has a master’s degree in fine arts, said he’s applied to roughly 1,000 jobs over the past year – everything from teaching to construction – with no luck.\n \n\n   \n  “To be 34 and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, things are pretty crappy right now,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Austin is supporting his partner, a veterinary student, and worries about how the two of them will pay off his student debt on top of all their other expenses.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to own a house and start a family, but I don’t know how we will ever get our feet under ourselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Living in two different worlds’ \n \n\n   \n  The Bank of America report is evidence of the K-shaped economy, where affluent Americans are faring far better than those at the bottom.\n \n\n   \n  Many are struggling to get by, even as President Donald Trump  dismisses affordability concerns  as a “con job” conjured up by Democrats based on “fake” polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the rate of increase in households living paycheck to paycheck has slowed significantly this year, and while there is little change this year for middle- and high-income households, the share of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck has jumped from 27% in 2023 to 29%, according to Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  “Higher income and lower income households are living in two different worlds,” Joe Wadford, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n     A growing wage gap \n \n\n   \n  The problem is that paychecks among lower-income households are often not keeping up with prices – especially now that  inflation has reaccelerated. \n \n\n   \n  After-tax wages increased about 2% in October year over year among middle-income consumers, Bank of America found. That’s below the 3% inflation rate as of September.\n \n\n   \n  Wage growth for lower-income Americans is falling even further behind. Their after-tax wages increased just 1% year-over-year.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, high-income wages jumped 4%, safely outpacing the increase in the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Wadford said the wage growth gap between high- and low-income Americans hasn’t been this high since 2016.\n \n\n   \n     ‘We’re getting nowhere’ \n \n\n   \n  For Millennials like Austin, that gap is even bigger.\n \n\n   \n  Wages have inched up just 1% for low-income Millennials, compared with 6% for high-income.\n \n\n   \n  “We work full-time and have degrees. And we’re getting nowhere,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY - Parthenon, said the large number of households living paycheck to paycheck underscores the “deepening affordability crisis” caused by five years of price hikes that have outpaced income gains.\n \n\n   \n  For the broader economy, the risk is that many families struggling to get by and worried about their jobs opt to spend much more cautiously.\n \n\n   \n  “This could weaken the foundation of a consumer-driven economy,” Daco said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s especially true if layoffs gather steam in what had been a no-fire, no-hire job market.\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs economists warned in a recent research report of a growing “risk of labor market deterioration.” The Wall Street bank estimates there is a 20% to 25% chance that the US unemployment rate jumps by at least 0.5 percentage points in the next six months. That’s up from just a 10% chance as of six months ago.\n \n\n   \n     Subprime auto loan troubles \n \n\n   \n  Some Americans are falling behind on their bills – especially those with low credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers who are at least  60 days late on their car loans  climbed to 6.65% in October, according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  That is the highest since Fitch tracking began in the early 1990s, surpassing the prior peak set in January and well above levels during the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  This trend is a clear sign of financial distress, especially since car loans are historically the last payment Americans are willing to miss.\n \n\n   \n  Bank of America has found that the number of households making just the minimum payment on their credit card is also rising, though so is the share of credit card users paying off their entire balance each month.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a mixed bag. There are some signs of consumer health, and yet, within the minority of people experiencing financial stress, pressure is mounting,” said Wadford, the Bank of America economist.\n \n\n   \n  Vanessa Jones, a 65-year-old grandmother living in Davenport, Iowa, took on a second nursing job two years ago because she couldn’t make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “The cost of living is way too high. My savings have been depleted. I haven’t tapped into my retirement, but that looks like the next step,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, the primary caregiver for her two grandchildren, was recently diagnosed with cancer and wound up with “astronomical” medical bills. Facing $85,000 in medical debt, she filed for bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  Jones pushed back on politicians arguing there is no affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “The people claiming prices are lower are not actually buying their own groceries or trying to find the cheapest place to get their car fixed,” she said. “They need to walk in our shoes.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-05:00","title":"'A death sentence for my son': Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities plan to deport at least 89 sick Palestinian patients—including children with severe medical conditions and elderly patients—from East Jerusalem hospitals back to Gaza, despite the fact that Gaza’s healthcare system has been nearly destroyed since the October 7, 2023 attack.

Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Yamen Al-Najjar recalls his past life – the days when he went to school and laughed regularly. Today, the 16-year-old lives with his mother in a cramped 6-square-meter room, just large enough to hold a hospital bed he seldom leaves.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is hard. I am sick and in pain all the time… I feel alone, and I miss home,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen, who has a bleeding disorder, was medically evacuated from Gaza City with his mother to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem just two days before the October 7 attack in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  His condition is rare, according to his mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, and his doctors, who have struggled to manage his symptoms and been unable to get him the treatment he needs, even in East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Najjar has been working to get her son medically evacuated to a third country for the last two years. She managed to get World Health Organization (WHO) approval for a medical transfer but has been looking for 14 months for a host country to accept her son for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, she got news that she said made her heart stop. Doctors at Makassed Hospital told her that Israeli authorities have decided to send all Gazan patients back home next week, even those who are currently undergoing treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “All my hard work will vanish before my eyes. I can’t comprehend how a sick child is going to be sent back to a disaster-stricken area… This is a death sentence for my son,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen and his mother are among at least 89 Gazan patients and their companions due for deportation, according to medical teams at Makassed Hospital and Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem. They told CNN that while most patients have agreed to return to Gaza, some are being sent against their will as there is no treatment for them in the battered enclave. The WHO said last month that 94% of hospitals there have been  damaged or destroyed .\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of those being deported are babies born to women who were brought to Jerusalem for treatment, while the oldest is 85 years old, hospital authorities said. Most have been in the city since before the war.\n \n\n   \n  Salwa Massad, a research manager at WHO, told CNN that the organization has been asked by the Israeli military’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate the transfer of the patients early next week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out COGAT about the potential deportation of sick Palestinians to Gaza but has yet to receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen’s father, brother and two sisters are in Gaza, displaced in a tent camp in Al-Mawasi in the south after their home in Gaza City was bombed. He hasn’t seen them in two years.\n \n\n   \n  His mother said Yamen’s condition is so poor, he wouldn’t be able to survive in a tent even for a few hours without medical treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “His blood pressure fluctuates, his temperature is always low, he bleeds all the time, and he suffers from body aches… I categorically refuse to return to Gaza,” she said, tearful.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli non-profit Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) called the attempt to return patients to Gaza “unacceptable from moral, medical, and legal standpoints,”, pointing to Gaza’s “nonfunctional” healthcare system.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure that patients in need of medical care continue to receive it in the hospitals where they are currently admitted, or in any other hospital in Israel or abroad,” Aseel Aburass, director of the Occupied Territories Department at PHRI told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Aburass stressed the importance of this obligation, saying it was Israel itself that destroyed Gaza’s health care system and so “cannot now shirk its responsibility for the lives and health of these patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel’s parliament echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Yamen’s welfare is Israel’s responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending them back under the current conditions will be a death blow; instead of dying from an airstrike, he will die from being deprived of medical treatment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I will die there in two days’\n \n\n   \n  Nafez Al Qahwaji, from Khan Younis in Gaza, told CNN that he has kidney failure and needs dialysis three times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “The hospital informed us yesterday that we will all be deported back to Gaza, I was shocked to hear this after knowing the inhuman conditions that patients live in in Gaza,” he said at Makassed Hospital. “Why do they want to throw me to hell, I will die there in two days.”\n \n\n   \n  Nael Ezzeddine, from Jabalya, has not objected to returning. He has a heart condition and has been at Makassed Hospital for 25 months. He said his home in Gaza was struck by the Israeli military and that he lost everything, but his loved ones are waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my family. I have 10 children and my wife – they are all displaced in a tent in Deir el-Balah. I want to go and be with them. I know how they suffer, but what will I do here?” he said. “They want to force us to leave, and they are threatening to send us back all the time… I’m tired of this. I just want to go to my family, even if I end up dying.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that sick patients from Gaza have faced this threat.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, Israeli authorities were preparing to send back 22 Palestinians from East Jerusalem to Gaza, including newborns and cancer patients. Israel’s Supreme Court then temporarily halted those plans following a petition by PHRI and a  CNN report  on the hospital patients.\n \n\n   \n  Most of Yamen’s paintings are colorful illustrations of nature, landscapes and Palestinian culture. He said his passion for art comes from his desire to “bring color back to a world that has turned gray.”\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my house, my siblings’ voices, my school, colors and the sea. I miss my toys that I gathered throughout my childhood, and every moment when Gaza was safe,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have suffered a lot and I just want to rest… I hope every child in Gaza lives like any child in the world… I don’t want any child to get sick or be afraid like me.”\n \n\n   \n   Correction: This story has been update to reflect that most of the patients have agreed to return to Gaza. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/solar-storm-northern-lights-forecast","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:14:00-05:00","title":"Millions saw unexpected northern lights, as a wild solar storm unfolded across the world","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful solar storm caused stunning auroras visible in unexpected places, including as far south as Florida and across the UK.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:14 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For two nights, dazzling auroras delighted sky-gazers in unexpected places, including in the US as far south as Florida. The cause: dual solar storms unleashed by the sun reaching Earth.\n \n\n   \n  A severe storm was initially predicted for Thursday as well, with the potential for the northern tier of the US to see auroras again in the evening. Forecasters at the National Weather Service’s  Space Weather Prediction Center  now believe Wednesday night might have been the last opportunity for the most intense conditions.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to creating auroral displays, geomagnetic storms can disrupt   communications, the power grid and satellite operations. The Space Weather Prediction Center said it had otified power grid and satellite operators in the US so they could prepare.\n \n\n   \n  The British Geological Survey initially believed the current solar activity could lead to a G5, or an extreme geomagnetic storm — the highest level on the scale. The survey also dubbed Tuesday’s event a “cannibal storm” that disrupted communications and GPS satellite accuracy.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, two Coronal Mass Ejections lifted off the sun a few hours apart,” the survey’s geomagnetism team explained. “The first one was moving more slowly than the second  …  and so the second one caught up with the first one and they amalgamated together by the time they reached Earth. Hence, the term ‘cannibalised,’ as the second one gobbled up the first one.”\n \n\n   \n  Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in geomagnetic storms.\n \n\n   \n  Forecasters at the Space Weather Prediction Center believe that the arrivals of the first two of three anticipated coronal mass ejections caused   Tuesday evening’s auroral display.\n \n\n   \n  “One of them packed a much stronger punch than we would have imagined originally,” said Shawn Dahl, forecaster at the center.\n \n\n   \n  When a storm reaches satellites stationed 1 million miles from Earth, forecasters can measure its speed, the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic orientation, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it pointed opposite Earth, or is it pointed the same as Earth?” Dahl said. “If it turns opposite Earth, then activity really quickly escalates, and those storm levels can dramatically increase very quickly. That’s what happened last night.”\n \n\n   \n  The third solar storm arrived at Earth Wednesday afternoon at 2:17 p.m. ET, with solar wind speeds over 2.1 million miles per hour (950 kilometers per second).\n \n\n   \n  But Earth appears to have been struck by a far flanking edge of the storm, meaning most of the magnetic cloud likely missed our planet, according to an  update from the center .\n \n\n   \n    Solar storm disruptions\n \n\n   \n  Among those feeling the storm’s effects is Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The company was  expected to launch  NASA’s  Escapade mission  — twin satellites   set to head on a long journey to Mars — aboard its New Glenn rocket Wednesday. But the increased solar activity blocked that launch attempt.\n \n\n   \n  “NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch,” according to a  post by Blue Origin  on social media platform   X. The company confirmed on X Wednesday evening that another launch attempt is now scheduled for Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A flurry of activity around our sun   sparked the storms. Three X-class flares, the most intense type of solar flare, have released from the sun this week, followed by a series of coronal mass ejections.\n \n\n   \n  The recent surge in activity stems from an active region of sunspots on the sun called AR 14274, according to Ryan French, a solar physicist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  “AR 14274 still has the potential to produce more X-class solar flares,” French said. “However, the region is now rotating away from us, so any eruptions from future flares are increasingly less likely to hit us as the days pass.”\n \n\n   \n  An X-class flare released Tuesday created a large solar particle storm, the largest since 2005, according to the British Geological Survey. Tuesday’s solar activity also created the largest measured geoelectric field since the survey’s records began in 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field can reach the ground, which triggers electricity in rocks and essentially creates an electric field in the ground. “This is usually tiny on the order of 0.001 Volt per kilometer but during geomagnetic storms it can be much larger,” the survey team noted.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, experts documented a value of 3.5 volts per kilometer in the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland, an unusually large number that “has not been recorded before,” according to the geological survey’s team.\n \n\n   \n  Large geoelectric fields can interfere with transformers and may even cause them to shut down or overheat.\n \n\n   \n    A changing solar cycle\n \n\n   \n  The sun has an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity. Heliophysicists believe the peak, called  solar maximum , occurred in October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we are still in a period of heightened solar activity, we are entering the decay phase of the solar cycle,” French said.   “(Although) sunspots and solar flares are fewer during this time, this is the period where the strongest solar flares typically occur.”\n \n\n   \n  Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored lights in the sky.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up.\n \n\n   \n  For those in areas   with clear dark skies, keep an eye out for auroras, which could dip over the US. In the UK, sky-gazers in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland had a good chance of seeing them as well, according to the survey.\n \n\n   \n  The last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in  May 2024 .\n \n\n   \n  The storm was a historic one, but fortunately it didn’t reach the level of the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire and remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded.\n \n\n   \n  During the May 2024 geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.\n \n\n   \n  Before May 2024, the last G5 storm to hit Earth occurred in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The recent outburst of activity reminds French of a severe geomagnetic storm that reached Earth in  October 2024 . Tuesday night’s storm clocked in as third strongest solar storm of the current solar cycle, French said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/black-soldiers-world-war-ii-cemetery","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Black Soldiers in WWII Removed from U.S. Military Cemetery in Netherlands Spark Controversy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2024, a commemorative panel honoring African American soldiers like 1st Lt.

Jefferson Wiggins, along with hundreds of other Black soldiers, were tasked with burying the dead in the southern Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  What was once a fruit orchard would become the final resting place for thousands of fallen US service members. It was difficult, gruesome work, done in near-constant rain and snow with only pick axes and shovels. Years later, Wiggins would recall how soldiers under his command in the 960th Quartermaster Service Company cried as they lowered the bodies of men into their graves.\n \n\n   \n  The site, in the village of Margraten located in the southeastern part of the Netherlands, became  one of the largest American military cemeteries  in Europe. And for months, visitors to the cemetery, which is run by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), haven’t been able to learn about the soldiers’ work.\n \n\n   \n  In March, the small, little-known federal agency took down a display from the cemetery’s visitor center that commemorates the contributions of Black soldiers like Wiggins, who ultimately reached the rank of first lieutenant and died in 2013, and highlights the discrimination they faced. Most Black soldiers were limited to non-combat roles during World War II.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a matter of a panel that has my husband’s name on it. That’s not the issue,” Wiggins’ widow, Janice, told CNN. “The issue is that these are a group of men who contributed to their country, who, like almost every soldier during World War II, went through great trauma and bore that for the rest of their lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins, who learned of the display’s removal in October from two Dutch filmmakers, said her late husband would “be disappointed, but not shocked.”\n \n\n   \n  “He wasn’t naive about the world he lived in,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC, which  oversees 26 permanent US military cemeteries , told CNN in a statement that the panel in question was taken down following “an internal review of interpretive content” under the agency’s previous secretary, Charles Djou, and there are currently four other displays highlighting individual African American servicemembers buried at the cemetery.\n \n\n   \n  Djou, a Biden appointee who says he was dismissed by President Donald Trump in April, told CNN in an email the panel’s removal was “done via an internal agency review at the prompting of the Trump administration.” CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC said, “The panel was initially added upon request by the former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.”\n \n\n   \n  “It was determined by the previous secretary, following the internal review in March, that while 1st Lt. Wiggins’ quote represented the immense contributions of many African American service members during the creation of the site, portions of the panels were outside the scope of ABMC’s commemorative mission. There was no external consultation or direction regarding its removal.”\n \n\n   \n  The panel, which was added to an exhibit at the cemetery’s $6.7 million visitor center in 2024, was titled, “African American Servicemembers in WWII: Fighting on Two Fronts.” It described how Black service members, “despite the ongoing fight for civil rights at home during an era of racist policies” enlisted in every military branch and faced “the horrors of war.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins pushed for a panel shortly after the center opened in 2023, when she learned that none of the information or exhibits included any mention of the African American soldiers who buried the dead there. She worked with the former US Ambassador to the Netherlands, Shefali Razdan Duggal, and Mieke Kirkels, a Dutch oral historian, and the panel was installed months later.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The stark reality’\n \n\n   \n  Wiggins waited until the late 2000s to revisit the memories of his service, which he would recount to Kirkels for an oral history after learning that he was the last known Black member of his unit alive.\n \n\n   \n  The first person they buried was a young German girl, Wiggins recalled in the oral history  rereleased in 2025 . Her body had been mangled by machine gun fire; her head deformed by a grenade blast. As the Allied forces pressed on, more and more bodies of young American men arrived on trucks for Wiggins and his men to lay to rest. Many had been killed during airborne operations in the east or in the course of advances into German territory.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a permanent arrival of bodies, the whole day long. Sundays included, seven days a week,” Wiggins said. “I find it difficult, even now, to read in the paper that soldiers ‘gave their lives.’ … All those boys in Margraten, their lives were taken away.”\n \n\n   \n  “And here we all were - this group of Black Americans having to deal with these bodies of White Americans,” he said. “The stark reality was we had to bury those soldiers although we couldn’t sit in the same room with them when they were alive.”\n \n\n   \n  For Wiggins, remembering what he saw was a painful, but necessary act. Janice Wiggins said he would often tell her that “people should know.” The contributions of Black soldiers during the war had been frequently overlooked — and in some cases lost forever. A fire at the  National Personnel Records Center  in 1973 destroyed millions of files.\n \n\n   \n  “He never ever wanted the story to be about him. He saw his story as a vehicle,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, a sharecropper’s son who had lied about his age to enlist in the military, became a lifelong educator and civil rights activist. He was 87 when he died.\n \n\n   \n    Removal causes local uproar\n \n\n   \n  Theo Bovens, a Dutch politician who leads the  Black Liberators in the Netherlands  project, told CNN that local and regional politicians have asked the ABMC to reinstall the panel, along with another that highlights Technician 4th Class George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier from Camden, New Jersey, who died while trying to save a fellow soldier who had fallen into a river in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  The ABMC told CNN on Monday that the Pruitt panel is “currently off display, though not out of rotation.” The part of the exhibit featuring Pruitt and other African American servicemembers at the cemetery, the agency said, has panels that were “designed to be removed and rotated.”\n \n\n   \n  Janice Wiggins told CNN that the “panels were never intended to be part of a traveling exhibit or rotation” and “were intended to be a permanent part of the Visitors Center exhibits.”\n \n\n   \n  The mayor of Eijsden-Margraten has formally asked the ABMC to reinstall the panels, insisting that the community values the contributions of Black American soldiers that helped liberate the Netherlands from the Nazis 80 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The governing body of the Limburg Province said it hopes to make a direct appeal to US Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo Jr. who was confirmed in October.\n \n\n   \n  “The displayed panels depicted a history we must never forget, and from which we can learn a great deal—especially now, as global divisions are being increasingly magnified,” the body said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/halligan-us-attorney-comey-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Judge Hears Arguments Thursday in Bid by James Comey and Letitia James to Disqualify Lindsey Halligan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A critical legal battle is unfolding in federal court over whether Lindsey Halligan, the interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia appointed by President Donald Trump, is lawfully serving in her role, as both James Comey and Letitia James argue that her appointment violated the 120-day interim rule.

Comey and Letitia James to disqualify Lindsey Halligan \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The criminal cases against two of the president’s fervent political adversaries face a critical test Thursday, as attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James argue in court that the prosecutor who single-handedly brought their charges is unlawfully serving in her post.\n \n\n   \n  The argument has put a target on Lindsey Halligan, President Donald Trump’s handpicked interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who was tapped for the job days after her predecessor was  ousted for resisting  bringing charges against James related to a mortgage fraud investigation.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge concludes that Halligan’s appointment is invalid, the decision could be a fatal blow to the cases against both Comey and James because she is the only federal prosecutor who signed their indictments, which were approved by a federal grand jury this fall.\n \n\n   \n  The  argument from both defendants  is relatively straightforward: A US attorney can only serve 120 days on a temporary basis before needing to be confirmed by the Senate. That period had elapsed by the time Halligan was installed as the interim US attorney for the judicial district in September.\n \n\n   \n  And, Comey’s and James’ defense attorneys say, the clock should not be reset just because a new person was appointed.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers, Comey’s attorneys warned that if the attorney general, who makes the appointments, could do so “back-to-back,” then the “120-day period would be rendered meaningless, and the Attorney General could indefinitely evade the alternate procedures that Congress mandated.”\n \n\n   \n  Under federal law, if the Senate hasn’t confirmed a nominee to serve in the role long-term and the 120-day period has passed, the judges in that judicial district must pick someone to serve in the role. In May, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia picked Erik Siebert, whose time as interim US attorney was coming to a close, to continue serving in the job.\n \n\n   \n   In Comey’s case,  his attorneys further argue that a different prosecutor wouldn’t be able to seek a new indictment against the former FBI director since the five-year statute of limitations in his case has already expired.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has  strongly pushed back , saying in court filings that even if the judge were to conclude Halligan is not lawfully serving in her role, the two indictments should not be tossed out altogether because the indictments don’t “hinge on her validly holding that particular office” of interim US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the department have also claimed that Attorney General Pam Bondi can appoint a new interim US attorney after 120 days “if a new vacancy arises.” But several other judges who have considered similar challenges to US attorneys in other states have rejected that argument in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge to Halligan’s authority is being heard in Alexandria, Virginia, by senior US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton who ordinarily sits in South Carolina. Currie was tapped to handle this part of the two cases given the role the other judges in the Eastern District of Virginia play in ensuring there is a top prosecutor in their district.\n \n\n   \n  Comey has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  James was charged last month with two counts: bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection to a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia. She has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Both trials are tentatively set for January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/style/escaramuza-cowgirl-fashion-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:56:00-04:00","title":"Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores escaramuza, an all-female equestrian sport rooted in Mexico and adapted in the United States, which challenges traditional gender norms in a historically male-dominated equestrian culture.

But the job isn’t done \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:56 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What does a cowgirl look like? For some, the question may call forth images of flanneled shirts, Stetson hats and bootcut jeans. But in escaramuza, the all-female equestrian sport imported by the US from Mexico, the answer is a little different.\n \n\n   \n  Before every escaramuza competition, each team lines up to have its uniforms measured. Strict guidelines dictate that the riders’ tiered Victoriana dresses, often vivid in color and trimmed with lace, must be long enough to cover their horses’ haunches. Glitter and beading are prohibited, but any accessories from earrings to brooches must match. Boots, too, should be identical throughout a team. Under each dress is a petticoat layer, as well as a pair of bloomers — both are to be steamed. One missing underlayer can disqualify the entire squad.\n \n\n   \n  Once they have passed their inspection, these spectacularly clad women go on to perform an elaborate synchronized routine while riding side-saddle. Their frothing dresses become fast-moving flurries of pink, purple and sky blue as they gallop across the arena.\n \n\n   \n  Photographer Constance Jaeggi spent the best part of two years traveling across the US to California, Texas, Idaho, Colorado, Oregon and Washington D.C. photographing these women, first for an exhibition at The National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, and later for the upcoming book “ Escaramuza: The Poetics of Home .”\n \n\n   \n  This visual clash — the strong, muscular horse working beneath layers of delicate petticoats — is one beloved by fashion. Dior’s former designer Maria Grazia Chiuri was inspired by the traditional costume of escaramuza, as seen via the brand’s 2019 Cruise runway show; while the September 2025 issue of Vogue, featured self-described horse girls Kendal Jenner and Gigi Hadid atop great steeds in lacy McQueen dresses.\n \n\n   \n  Jaeggi hopes people will come for her vibrant portraits of beautifully dressed women, and stay for a more layered and complex story about feminism, immigration and personal sacrifice. “I think the fashion aspect of it is the easy entry point,” Jaeggi said in a video interview.\n \n\n   \n  Along with taking their photograph, Jaeggi would watch hours of team rehearsals and often ate dinner with her subjects in their home. She interviewed the women and passed along their recorded conversations to Mexican-American writers Ire’ne Lara Silva, the 2023 Texas State Poet Laureate, and Angelina Sáenz, who wrote 15 accompanying poems each in both Spanish and English. The result is a tale of two halves — the calm, predictable waters of Jaeggi’s images, versus a tense storm brewing in the words of the poets.\n \n\n   \n   “When I started researching and speaking to the escaramuza, I realized how important the oral histories were to their story,” she said. Jaeggi was also “hyper aware” of the fact that she isn’t Mexican-American herself. “I don’t have that cultural, personal connection and I felt it was important to make sure that was a major part of the work.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead of visiting the sport’s home country, Jaeggi was instead drawn to the women who were working hard to establish escaramuza in the US. “In Mexico, it really is the sport of the wealthy,” she said. But the performers she met, most of them first or second generation immigrants, told a different story. From bake sales to fund the cost of the extravagant, hand-made dresses for competitions (the gowns cost roughly $300 to $400 each and are imported across the Mexican border) to putting gas in each others cars, the teams Jaeggi met were financially interdependent communities with one shared goal: furthering their athletic craft.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the stories I kept hearing was that it took them years, like a couple of generations, to be able to afford to have horses and to be able to do this sport,” she said. “It made it even more impressive to me, the fact that they dedicate so many of their resources to it.” When discussions moved onto the topic of immigration “there was some hesitance” for women to go on the record, Jaeggi said, because they were undocumented. That was in 2023 — before President Trump’s mission of  mass deportation  and deployment of ICE. “It’s a difficult political climate right now,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout Jaeggi’s book, there is an undercurrent of inequality that regularly bubbles to the surface. Escaramuza is a five- to 10-minute drop in the three-hour ocean of traditional charrería — the exclusively male ranching and horsemanship competition that is also Mexico’s national sport. Charrería was declared as Mexico’s national sport in 1933, though women were only allowed to perform as an entertaining half-time show in 1953. Escaramuza was not recognized as an athletic competitive event until 1992. Even today, the uniforms of male riders are not inspected as rigorously as their female counterparts, Jaeggi notes, a reason she coyly attributes to “interesting gender dynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  While the women are eager to maintain their traditions and culture, they feel weighed down by the sport’s strict, essentialist views on gender. It’s a knotty back-and-forth that mostly comes through in writing. “Women/Are second class citizens in this sport,” reads one line of a Sáenz poem, “You are prettier when you are quiet.” In another work, “Machetona,” Silva interprets the struggle of a lesbian teammate who tries to rally against the inherent misogyny of escaramuza. The history of side-saddle, for example, comes from the fear that riding astride risks breaking a woman’s hymen, compromising the evidence of her virginity and, therefore, her value.\n \n\n   \n  “When it came to issues around gender and feminism, and pushing against some of these gender boundaries, I think most women were really willing to talk about it,” Jaeggi said. “They felt like their voices weren’t always heard in their community, and so there was a lot of frustration that was coming out. Those were really great conversations.”\n \n\n   \n  In “The Poetics of Home,” pride and frustration are intermingled in equal parts. But all can agree that an imperfect community is better than none. The “sisterhood,” as escaramuza is often referred to in the book, gives these women purpose, direction and a sense of belonging. “A sisterhood/Born of struggling and dreaming and training,” reads Silva’s poem “Lo Nuestro.” And as much as this sport is rooted in heritage, the women competing today have their sights set on the future. Jaeggi remembers a conversation with an escaramuza rider, who told her that “one of the main reasons she does this sport is she wants little girls, the next generation, to see that as a woman, you too can ride a horse.”\n \n\n   \n  “For a long time within charrería they weren’t,” she said. “The thought of having a woman compete alongside a man, or ride alongside a man on a horse, was unthinkable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/china-iran-chemical-shipments-congress-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"05:17:00-04:00","title":"US Lawmakers Demand Answers from Trump Administration Over Chinese Chemical Shipments to Iran","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US lawmakers, including Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, have demanded answers from the Trump administration over reports that Chinese firms are shipping sodium perchlorate—key to ballistic missile propellant—to Iran since late September 2025.

chemical shipments to Iran following CNN reporting \n       \n  By Gianluca Mezzofiore, Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:17 AM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US lawmakers have called for the Trump administration to respond to reporting that Chinese firms are helping Iran rebuild its ballistic missile program in defiance of United Nations sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The call, from Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, follows  CNN reporting last month  detailing what Western intelligence sources said were several shipments of sodium perchlorate, a missile propellant precursor, from China to Iran since the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  These shipments are “indispensable to Tehran’s efforts to rebuild its ballistic missile arsenal following its  12-day war with Israel  last summer,” the congressmen wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Central Intelligence Agency director John Ratcliffe.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing’s support for Tehran’s rearmament is deeply concerning and provides yet another example of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) willingness to abet authoritarian aggression from Europe to the Middle East,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  According to CNN’s reporting, European intelligence sources say 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas between late September and mid-October. The chemicals were bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers, the sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries, which analysts say could provide enough chemical for roughly 500 ballistic missiles, appear to show Iran is stepping up the rebuilding of its missile program, which was depleted by the conflict with Israel in June.\n \n\n   \n  They also come as there has been increased concern in Washington about  potential emerging coordination  between China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last month  for talks that resulted in an economic truce de-escalating their trade war.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing’s latest shipments of these critical chemical precursors indicate that US actions to date have failed to deter it from supporting Tehran’s procurement of offensive military capabilities,” Krishnamoorthi, who is the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, and Courtney, ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, wrote in their letter.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s support “not only increases Iran’s threat to its neighbors but also assists Russia and pro-Iranian proxy groups like the Houthis whose missile programs Iran has previously supported,” the Congressmen said.\n \n\n   \n  The shipments also “contravene sanctions the United Nations reinstated in September that prohibit international support for Iran’s ballistic missile program and development of nuclear weapons delivery systems,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  Krishnamoorthi and Courtney called for the Trump administration to explain what actions it was taking to “respond to the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) continuing support to Iran’s ballistic missile program,” including in coordination with US allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in April  announced  sanctions on a dozen entities and individuals based in Iran and China for their role procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions on Tehran were restored by a so-called snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms.\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n    China and Iran\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the UN sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue,” and may not see it bound by those rules, as such.\n \n\n   \n  In response to a question from CNN last month about the recent shipments, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that while he “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporting last month followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew.\n \n\n   \n  Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had  previously been reported , and entities in China,  long a diplomatic and economic ally  of Iran, are also known to use a network of vessels to filter US-sanctioned Iranian oil to the country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/house-vote-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00-05:00","title":"How Each House Member Voted on Ending the Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives passed a Senate-backed funding bill on November 12, 2025, by a vote of 222–209 to end a record-setting government shutdown.

November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump’s much-heralded peace declaration between Thailand and Cambodia is falling apart after the two countries accused each other of opening fire along their disputed border on Wednesday, in skirmishes that killed at least one person.\n \n\n   \n  The brief clash came two days after Thailand said it was  suspending a peace agreement  reached between the two Southeast Asian kingdoms, and presided over by Trump, after several Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion while on patrol in the border area Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia fought a  five-day border conflict  in July that killed dozens of people and displaced about 200,000 on both sides of the frontier. Trump had  hailed his intervention  in the dispute as further proof of his ability to end wars, and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n \n\n   \n  An initial ceasefire between the two sides was agreed on July 28 after the US president held calls with their respective leaders. Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Kuala Lumpur in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that Thai soldiers opened fire on civilians in a border village in its northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, killing one person and wounding three others.\n \n\n   \n  The Thai military opened fire at 3:50 p.m. and again some two hours later, ministry spokesperson Lt Gen. Maly Socheata said in a statement.  Cambodia accused Thailand of carrying out “provocative actions over the past few days with the intention of inciting clashes,” in violation of the peace declaration.\n \n\n   \n  The same village, which both sides claim, was the site of a confrontation in September between Thai security personnel and Cambodian villagers. Thai police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to suppress protesters, according to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Contradicting the Cambodian version of events, a Thai army spokesperson said Cambodian troops had opened fire toward the Thai side in its eastern Sa Kaeo province at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thai troops took cover and fired warning shots toward the direction of the gunfire in accordance with the rules of engagement,” army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Winthai Suwaree said.\n \n\n   \n  There were no Thai casualties or injuries and the incident lasted about 10 minutes, Winthai added.\n \n\n   \n  The clash came after Thailand on Monday said it was “halting all agreements” with Cambodia and would explain its decision to Washington after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand. Thailand accused Cambodia of planting fresh landmines, a claim the Cambodian government denied.\n \n\n   \n  Though Wednesday’s clash was brief, it marked a significant reignition of hostilities after Bangkok and Phnom Penh’s peace declaration that included commitments from both sides to de-escalate tensions, withdraw heavy weapons from the border, and conduct de-mining efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he “strongly condemns” the latest clash as an act against international law, and called for an independent investigation into the incident.\n \n\n   \n  “I call on the Thai side to immediately cease the use of force against innocent Cambodian civilians,” Hun Manet said in a Facebook post, adding that Cambodia remains committed to the ceasefire agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought over their disputed border for decades, but the fighting in July was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the border flare-up.\n \n\n   \n  The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border, and the territorial dispute over demarcated portions of it largely stems from a map drawn up by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony, which Thailand does not accept.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/asia/pakistan-powers-for-army-chief-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"21:45:00-05:00","title":"Pakistan Parliament Approves More Powers for Army Chief, Curb Top Court","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan’s parliament has approved a constitutional amendment that significantly expands the powers of the army chief, Asim Munir, by elevating him to Chief of Defence Forces with lifetime immunity and command over all three branches of the armed forces.

Ford Carrier Strike Group will support other warships that have been carrying out  deadly strikes  on suspected drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean over the past two months.\n \n\n   \n  Though Washington insists the military buildup is aimed at disrupting the flow of narcotics to the United States, Caracas believes the US is really trying to force regime change, and some US officials have privately conceded their strategy is aimed at removing President Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment is shared by some Venezuelan citizens in Caracas’ El Rosal office district, who say the US should stay out of other countries’ affairs.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems the United States shouldn’t interfere in that way. I think it’s an abuse,” says Noemí Lozada, a housewife.\n \n\n   \n  José Román, a salesman, says that although he feels there is an imminent threat, people are acting as if nothing is happening. “We are not a warmongering country. I don’t think we ever have been, and I don’t think anyone here has prepared for this, nor will they.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Frank Molina, a personal trainer, says he already knows what he would do if the situation with the United States were to escalate to confrontation. “We are Venezuelans and we will die with our boots on, and I am proud to be Venezuelan and I will defend my homeland to the death,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions between the US and Venezuela have simmered for months amid the potential for more direct action.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has  reported  that the Trump administration is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside the South American nation. But the administration has also told Congress in recent days that the US did not have a  legal justification  that would support strikes within Venezuela, though CNN has reported that officials are considering what such a legal opinion would look like.\n \n\n   \n  In Venezuela, local news stations are covering the issue closely, though under the watchful eye of the government and with its “official” version dominating the screens. Maduro’s administration closely monitors what is said in the national media, carefully controlling every word and issuing warnings when it deviates from that line.\n \n\n   \n  But online, social media is awash with speculation that a political change is imminent.\n \n\n   \n  And back on the streets of Caracas, some appear receptive to the idea of a US intervention, suggesting it could bring much-needed change to a country experiencing economic and humanitarian  challenges .\n \n\n   \n  “Well, people are quite anxious, but I think most of them are happy … about the arrival of the aircraft carrier,” says an administrator, who CNN is not naming, for safety reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Another woman who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisal says, “We need help from the United States, unquestionably. If not, we cannot get out of this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Others acknowledge that there’s “a lot of uncertainty” but say that, as accountant Margarita Fernández puts it, Venezuelans are “ready and prepared for anything … I mean, for things to change.”\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, the country’s situation and everything makes me a bit nervous,” says painter Enrique Díaz. “But it’s quite unpleasant that we have to go through this because, while it’s a benefit in some ways, it’s also a discomfort for the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela said this week that it was launching a “ massive mobilization ” of military personnel, weapons and equipment in response to the US build-up.\n \n\n   \n  Land, air, naval and reserve forces were scheduled to carry out exercises through Wednesday, according to Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, who described the US deployments as an “imperialist threat.”\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to make its way to the Caribbean from Europe late last month. It brings with it nine air squadrons, anti-surface capabilities, and integrated air and missile defense command ship USS Winston S. Churchill.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/epstein-trump-emails-boebert-mace-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-05:00","title":"Trump is getting pulled deeper and deeper into the Epstein drama","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, obtained by the House Oversight Committee, reveal direct references to Donald Trump, including claims that Trump spent time at Epstein’s home and was described as 'borderline insane' or 'f**king crazy' by Epstein.

It opened when House Oversight Committee Democrats  released three emails  newly acquired from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump. This was soon followed by a torrent of other emails, some referencing the president, from the GOP-led panel.\n \n\n   \n  It did not immediately appear that the trove of material created any new legal issues for Trump. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it proved “absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But the explosive content — which included Epstein and his now-jailed accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell discussing Trump — was the kind of gossipy jet fuel that can ensure scandals defy all attempts at containment and significantly worsened Trump’s political predicament on the issue. It was also the latest twist in a story with an extraordinary capacity to tarnish reputations, which, unlike its main protagonist, will not die.\n \n\n   \n  Political earthquakes are now rumbling on both sides of the Atlantic. Washington is on scandal alert. In the UK, the aftershocks just led to the  defenestration of a prince  — Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — and the  dismissal of a lord  as ambassador to Washington — Peter Mandelson — both over their past friendships with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Most seriously for the president, Wednesday’s disclosures raised questions over whether he’s been fully transparent about what he knew about Epstein — a former fellow New York and Florida resident, who killed himself in prison in 2019. At the least, the emails implied Trump knew more than he’s been prepared to let on about a wealthy convicted pedophile who moved in the highest society circles alongside powerful men in New York and London.\n \n\n   \n  In one email on April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. (REDACTED) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” Maxwell responded: “I have been thinking about that…”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight Committee identified the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. They accused Democrats of hiding her name because she did not allege Trump did something wrong.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in an interview this year that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” and that she didn’t recall ever seeing Trump at Epstein’s house. She said she did witness the two men together in social settings. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n \n\n   \n  Other material was embarrassing for Trump. Epstein called him “borderline insane” in  a 2018 email exchange  with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. In another email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017, a week after Trump signed an executive order banning the entry of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, Epstein said, “Donald is f**king crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  A year later, Epstein wrote, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about him, in an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Epstein also emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and Ruemmler in March 2018.\n \n\n   \n    An overbearing White House response makes the political drama worse\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein saga has dogged Trump for months. He’s tried and failed to shut it down, for instance when he lashed out in a Cabinet meeting in July, telling a reporter he didn’t know why people were still talking “about this guy, this creep.”\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the latest focus on the Epstein affair has underscored why the Justice Department makes it a practice not to release investigative files when prosecutions are not deemed appropriate. Disclosures can harm the reputations of those involved when they are not charged or accused of wrongdoing, or are merely witnesses who provided testimony or were mentioned in evidence.\n \n\n   \n  But incredibly, the latest political ramifications of the Epstein affair were triggered by administration officials themselves, with Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi pledging to release files before going back on their word. That has created the frenzy of speculation over what is contained in the full record of the case.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s left Trump accused of a classic Washington cover-up. As Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw put it in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. “It would make a lot more sense for him to just say, ‘Let’s release the full files and get it all out there and get it all over with.’”\n \n\n   \n  Walkinshaw went on: “Why doesn’t he want to do that? What’s in those files that he wants to allow this drip, drip, drip of bad news to continue?”\n \n\n   \n  Despite new denials of wrongdoing by Trump and his aides, Wednesday’s releases set off the latest overbearing, and frankly strange, effort by officials to quell the drama. In an extraordinary meeting exclusively reported by CNN, top officials met a single lawmaker, Rep. Lauren Boebert, in  the White House Situation Room , a venue fabled for its use in national security crises. Multiple sources said before the meeting that a heavyweight line-up of Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was expected.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting raised the question of whether the White House hoped to get the Colorado lawmaker to pull her name from a petition that will force GOP House leaders to  allow a vote  on releasing investigative files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  Boebert later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  It was another stunning twist in a saga that makes the White House look not just clumsy but as if it is trying to orchestrate a cover-up, even as Trump’s aides insist there is nothing to hide.\n \n\n   \n  The Situation Room meeting was just the latest bizarre intervention by Trump’s aides in the Epstein case. In July, Blanche traveled to interview Maxwell, and the Justice Department later released the transcript and tape of her saying that the president had never at any time behaved inappropriately. Shortly afterward, Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, was moved to a far less draconian prison.\n \n\n   \n  Underlining the failure of the latest White House damage-control effort, GOP Rep. Nancy Mace confirmed to CNN’s Jake Tapper that she did not intend to try to remove her name from the discharge petition. “I will never turn my back on other survivors,” she wrote in a text message. “The work is too important. No one believes us. And we never get justice.” The petition got its pivotal signature on Wednesday with the  swearing-in of a newly elected Democratic lawmaker , which had been delayed for weeks by Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n    How can Trump tamp down the controversy?\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s drama was precipitated by the return of the House for the first time since mid-September. The immediate focus on Epstein seemed to reinforce a claim by Johnson’s critics that one of his aims in keeping lawmakers at home during the shutdown was to tamp down the Epstein storm. If that was the case, he only made it worse. The speaker had no choice but to announce that the House next week will vote, against the wishes of the White House, on a resolution requiring the Department of Justice to release files from the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  One question now is how on earth does Trump — whose  approval ratings  are already dipping fast, and who is struggling to empathize with a wave of economic anxiety rippling across the country — ever make all of this go away?\n \n\n   \n  Time and again, the president’s achievements have been overshadowed by the return of the Epstein case. While it is not clear that this is an issue that will decide many votes in the 2026 midterm elections, it’s a constant distraction for the White House. Questions about Trump’s character and past did not stop him twice winning the presidency. But the Epstein issue is a rare controversy that has caused a backlash with his base, even though there’s no sign yet that it will sever his almost mythical bond with his most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  But on this question, at least, he’s failed to pull the GOP into line. He made increasingly frantic efforts on social media to portray the email releases as all part of a Democratic plot. His efforts failed. Now, the number of Republican lawmakers who back the release of the documents will be closely watched.\n \n\n   \n  Any large-scale Republican revolt against the president in the House vote could be latest sign that his impregnable support from the GOP on Capitol Hill is beginning to crumble, following the failure of his demands on Republican senators to remove the filibuster rule in their chamber, which frustrated him during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And a strong vote from Republicans to release the files might also heap more pressure on Republicans in the Senate to vote for disclosure. “I’ve already had a couple Republicans tell my office privately that they’re going to vote for it, and I think that could snowball,” Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has braved fierce pressure from the White House, told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n \n\n   \n  In another sign of growing tensions in the House, another Republican, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee launched an unsuccessful bid to force the release of all the Epstein files immediately. “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” Burchett said.\n \n\n   \n  This was the latest indication, that, in Epstein’s words, the “dog that hasn’t barked” over his association with Trump is barking now. Everyone in Washington and around the globe can hear it. And ominously for Trump, the White House seems to have no idea how it can be silenced.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/government-shutdown-funding-bill-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"11:16:00-11:16","title":"President Trump signs bill to reopen government, ending longest shutdown in US history","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan funding bill to end a 43-day federal government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, after a compromise reached between Republicans and centrist Senate Democrats.

\n        11:16 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed a funding package to  reopen the federal government , officially bringing a close to the longest shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  The final approval came hours after the House voted 222 to 209 to pass a deal struck between Republicans and centrist Senate Democrats that keeps the government running through January and ensures some key agencies will be funded for the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement, which ended a record 43-day stalemate in Congress, will also reverse the mass federal layoffs carried out by Trump during the shutdown. It paves the way for paychecks to flow to government employees, as well as the resumption of critical food and nutrition services relied on by tens of millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Wednesday night cast the legislation as a victory over Democrats, calling it “a clear message that we will never give in to extortion, because that’s what it was, they tried to extort.”\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t want to do it the easy way,” he said from the Oval Office, attacking what he called “the extremists” in the Democratic Party. “They had to do it the hard way, and they look very bad.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House signing ceremony was attended by a range of Republican lawmakers and capped a four-day sprint to pass the funding bill, after eight Senate Democrats broke ranks to compromise with Republicans amid worries about the shutdown’s widening economic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  The deal guarantees an early December vote in the Senate on the expiring Obamacare subsidies that Democrats made the focus of their demands during the shutdown fight. But a vote to extend the subsidies is unlikely to succeed, a likelihood that’s driven intense blowback across the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  Most congressional Democrats loudly protested the bill in the run-up to Wednesday’s vote over concerns Americans’ health care premiums will skyrocket without the subsidies, with only six House Democrats voting in favor of the package.\n \n\n   \n  “This fight is not over. We’re just getting started,” top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote. “Tens of millions of Americans are at risk of being unable to afford to go see a doctor when they need it.”\n \n\n   \n  Back in Washington for the first time since mid-September, Speaker Mike Johnson corralled almost all Republicans behind the bill, despite sharp complaints from some of his members over a contentious provision added by Senate Republicans that allowed senators to retroactively sue the Department of Justice for obtaining phone records during a Biden-era probe – potentially amounting to a major financial windfall for those lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson himself said he was blindsided by the language, and he said he didn’t know about it until the Senate had already passed the package.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked by it, I was angry about it,” the speaker said, though he added that he did not believe Senate Majority Leader John Thune added it in a nefarious manner. “I think it was a really bad look, and we’re going to fix it in the House.”\n \n\n   \n  To win over conservative holdouts, Johnson vowed that the House would take a future vote to strip that language — though it’s unclear if the Senate would take it up. Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas ultimately agreed not to amend the language in the current stopgap bill, since it would require the Senate to return to Washington to vote again and delay the end of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Conservatives like Roy had blasted that provision as “self-dealing,” since it would award senators $500,000 or more in damages for each violation by the government if their lawsuit is successful. The amendment appeared to benefit eight senators in particular who had been subpoenaed by the previous administration into investigations into Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations panel, accused those eight senators of voting “to shove taxpayer dollars into their own pockets – $500,000 for each time their records were inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  The House Democrats who voted in favor of the compromise bill to reopen the government were: Reps. Jared Golden, Adam Gray, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Henry Cuellar, Tom Suozzi and Don Davis. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie voted and Greg Steube against the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The end of the government shutdown will usher in a frenetic few weeks of work for the House, which has been largely shuttered since late September. As part of the GOP’s pressure campaign on Democrats, Johnson had decided to keep all members out of Washington until Senate Democrats agreed to back the GOP’s existing funding plan.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Republicans and Democrats have just four weeks in session before the end of the year — when those Obamacare tax credits expire. Trump has called for revamping the law rather than extending the existing subsidies, setting up a high-stakes showdown over health care that could carry political ramifications for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Obamacare was a disaster,” Trump said Wednesday night. “We’ll work on something having to do with health care. We can do a lot better.”\n \n\n   \n  But there are plenty of other deadlines, including Congress’ farm bill and a slew of expiring energy credits. \n \n\n   \n  House Republicans are also eager to pass as many spending bills as possible to improve their negotiating stance with the Senate ahead of that next deadline on January 30.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson also faces another hot-button issue: the question of how Congress should handle the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  Not long before the votes to reopen the government got underway, a newly elected Democrat — Rep. Adelita Grijalva — became the critical 218th signature to force a vote to compel the Justice Department to release all of its case files related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson announced to reporters soon after Grijalva signed the petition that he will put a bill compelling the Department of Justice to release all of its Epstein case files on the House floor next week – earlier than expected, and after an extraordinary White House pressure campaign earlier Wednesday failed to convince any Republicans to remove their name from the petition.\n \n\n   \n  The effort coincided with intensifying scrutiny over the Epstein files in the House. Earlier Wednesday, House Democrats on the Oversight panel released  new emails that  showed Epstein had repeatedly mentioned Trump by name in private correspondence, and then the GOP-led committee released 200,000 pages of documents the panel received from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/what-to-know-epstein-estate-documents","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"12:37:00.000Z","title":"What’s inside the thousands of Epstein estate documents released by House committee","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Oversight Committee released thousands of pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing detailed emails in which he repeatedly referenced President Donald Trump, describing him as 'borderline insane,' 'f**king crazy,' and 'dirty.'

13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House Oversight Committee on Wednesday released an additional  20,000 pages of documents  the GOP-led panel received from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose death by suicide spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew.\n \n\n   \n  The emails include a message in which Epstein asserts  President Donald Trump  “knew about the girls” — seemingly in reference to Trump’s  claim that he kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club  for poaching young women who worked there. Epstein also wrote, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about Trump in a 2018 email to a White House counsel under former President Barack Obama. The disgraced financier also emailed about Trump’s mental state in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the emails, saying  they prove “nothing. ” Trump  accused Democrats of bringing up  Epstein to “deflect” from their handling of  the government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporters went through the thousands of files, and you can read highlights below:\n \n\n   \n    Here’s what’s written in some of the emails\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Kaitlin Collins \n \n\n   \n  CNN reviewed some of the emails released from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee this morning in which Jeffrey Epstein mentions President Donald Trump by name.\n \n\n   \n  In one email dated April 2, 2011, which CNN has independently reviewed, Epstein emailed his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [REDACTED] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”\n \n\n   \n  GOP members of the House Oversight committee  identified  the person as Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors who died by suicide in April, and accused Democrats of hiding her name because she had not alleged Trump to have done anything wrong.\n \n\n   \n  The latest release also included emails between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, including one from January 2019 during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  According to the email reviewed by CNN, Epstein wrote to Wolff apparently to address Trump’s claim that he asked Epstein to resign his membership at the president’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n \n\n   \n  “trump said he asked me to resign,” Epstein wrote, adding, “never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” and Trump himself has said Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa while explaining why their relationship ended. In longtime Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell’s  interview earlier this year  with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, she denied recruiting at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s association with Epstein has long been public, though the president has denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein called Trump ‘borderline insane’ in 2018, newly released documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  In one of the thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee today, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein called President Donald Trump “borderline insane” in a 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump – borderline insane,” Epstein wrote on December 22, 2018.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what prompted the exchange between Epstein and Summers.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein associates sent him updates on Trump selling his jet, newly released documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  Some of the emails among the thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee today show Jeffrey Epstein getting updates about Donald Trump selling a private plane.\n \n\n   \n  In a message from April 2011, someone told Epstein, “I hear Trump has a contract on his B272” but “no money has changed hands” yet. The sender is redacted.\n \n\n   \n  Someone told Epstein in a May 2011 email, “Trump’s B727 sold for 2.7M.” The sender is redacted, but Epstein and an accountant and lawyer were copied.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein called Trump ‘f**king crazy’ in January 2017 email, new documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  A week after Donald Trump was inaugurated to his first term as US president, he signed an executive order  banning the entry  of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, widely referred to as the “Muslim ban.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeffrey Epstein said in an email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017: “IT helps as he is seen as keeping his word.”\n \n\n   \n  He added later in the email: “That being said Donald is f**king crazy, I told you that.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein discussed Trump’s 2016 campaign with Soon-Yi Previn, new documents show\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  The emails show an interesting exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and Soon-Yi Previn, the wife of controversial filmmaker Woody Allen.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent an article to Previn, titled, “Bill Clinton’s CIA chief joins Trump campaign.”  The article , published by The Hill in September 2016, was about the former Clinton-appointed CIA director James Woolsey joining Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “Woody said it doesn’t mean anything,” Previn wrote in response to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why Epstein flagged the news to Previn and what if any interest she or her husband would have had in Woolsey’s involvement with Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell coordinated public response after 2015 lawsuit alleged sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  In January 2015, an anonymous woman – later revealed to be Virginia Roberts Giuffre –  filed a lawsuit  alleging that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell groomed and sexually abused her between 1998 and 2002. The lawsuit alleged they forced her to become a “sex slave” to powerful men – including a royal prince later revealed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Mountbatten-Windsor, who  has been stripped of his prince title , has denied the allegation and  later settled a lawsuit  Giuffre filed against him.\n \n\n   \n  In several email exchanges on January 10, 2015, after the lawsuit was filed, Epstein and Maxwell coordinated their public response to the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Initial response, too many unanswered question [sic] raised, relationship with jeffrey/…I am writing to writin [sic] to respond to alleagtinoin [sic] that have been made wchich [sic] are categorically untrue,” Epstein wrote Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell responded by asking if her lawyer could speak with a lawyer, then wrote: “I have to distance myself from you in statement too. And they need me to say I was not aware of massage w/ andrew in my house. These things they have to stay along w/ meeting [REDACTED] and rebutting those allegations. I needs it asap.”\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein assured Maxwell he was on the phone with his lawyer about getting her a lawyer, she replied, “I need it written out in full.”\n \n\n   \n  “Call me,” Epstein replied.\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell later  settled  a defamation lawsuit with Giuffre in June 2017 for an undisclosed sum.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the Justice Department this summer, Maxwell said her relationship with Epstein was  “almost nonexistent”  between 2010 and 2019 outside of corresponding over legal matters.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed about Trump’s mental state with his personal attorney and a former Obama official\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In a March 24, 2018, email chain with  Kathryn   Ruemmler , a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein  shared  a Daily Beast article titled, “How Close Is Donald Trump to a Psychiatric Breakdown?”\n \n\n   \n  The exchange shows Epstein forwarding the story early that morning to Ruemmler, with her replying: “Not confidence inspiring.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein then responded: “but – accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  A year earlier in July 2017, Ruemmler wrote an email to Epstein saying, “Trump is truly stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  “Duh,” Epstein replied several hours later.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why Ruemmler and Epstein were corresponding at the time.\n \n\n   \n  But the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2023  that a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler was then employed, said she had a professional relationship with Epstein in connection with her role at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.\n \n\n   \n  Ruemmler did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2018, Epstein emailed Ruemmler about Trump’s behavior, writing:\n \n\n   \n  “you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power. tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.”\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Epstein forwarded the same comment to Reid Weingarten, an  attorney  who worked for him.\n \n\n   \n  Weingarten replied that Trump was “starting to behave very erratically.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back: “borderline insane. and corroborated by some that are close.”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein questioned whether Trump had ‘early dementia’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski \n \n\n   \n  In early January 2018, as questions swirled about Trump’s behavior  following the release  of Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury,” Epstein exchanged a series of emails with a reporter at The New York Times discussing the president’s mental state.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the reporter an  excerpt  of the book that ran in New York Magazine.\n \n\n   \n  The reporter remarked that Trump was “looking/sounding increasingly unhinged,” Epstein replies, “no questions donalds statement is goofy. . early dementia?”\n \n\n   \n    Epstein emailed then-Prince Andrew: ‘you ok?’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Kara Scannell \n \n\n   \n  In March 2011, as the Epstein scandal was picked up by British tabloids focusing on then-Prince Andrew’s involvement, Epstein reached out to Andrew to ask how he was doing.\n \n\n   \n  “you ok?” Epstein wrote to an email identified as “The Duke,” an apparent reference to Andrew, known at the time as the Duke of York. “these stories are complete ant (sic) utter fantasy.”\n \n\n   \n  King Charles stripped Andrew of his prince title last month and forced him to move out of the royal residence. Andrew  relinquished his title  as Duke of York weeks beforehand.\n \n\n   \n    Jeffrey Epstein in 2018: ‘I know how dirty Donald is’\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Marshall Cohen \n \n\n   \n  In an August 2018 email to Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein wrote that, “I know how dirty Donald is,” referring to potential scandals that might come out about Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein sent the message on August 23, 2018, after Trump’s longtime fixer Michael Cohen  pleaded guilty  to federal campaign finances crimes. As part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors, Cohen  implicated Trump  in a 2016 hush-money scheme involving payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair, which Trump denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You see, I know how dirty Donald is,” Epstein wrote in the email. “My guess is that non-lawyers NY biz people have no idea what it means to have your fixer flip.”\n \n\n   \n  The email conversation began when Ruemmler sent Epstein a  New York Times column  about the Cohen guilty plea and what it might mean for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Her email said, “The principled case for impeachment is clear. What’s missing is the courage,” quoting the column.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was not impeached and he never faced any federal charges over the matter despite a  lengthy investigation . However, the Manhattan district attorney later won an indictment of Trump on state charges in connection with the matter.  Trump was convicted  last year of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payments.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein corresponded with Steve Bannon about then-Prince Andrew and Trump\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Em Steck \n \n\n   \n  In early June 2019, President Trump made a state visit to the United Kingdom, where he was welcomed by the former Prince Andrew. A  photo shows Andrew grinning  as he shakes Trump’s hand.\n \n\n   \n  In a June 2019 email exchange with Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Jeffrey Epstein wrote, “prince andrew and trump today.. Tooo [sic] funny.” And then he added, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago [sic].”\n \n\n   \n  Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u [sic] the connective tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what exactly Bannon meant by the message. Trump  fired him from the White House  in 2017, though Bannon remained influential in conservative politics as he does today.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Andrew  socialized together  in the 1990s and 2000s, per newspaper reports, alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sometimes at Mar-A-Lago. King Charles  stripped Andrew of his prince title  in October.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Bannon for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n \n\n   \n    Epstein said he ‘gave’ his young girlfriend to Trump in the 1990s. Trump has denied wrongdoing\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Aaron Blake \n \n\n   \n  Many of the exchanges from the emails feature people implying Epstein had damaging information about Trump and suggesting that he go public with it.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein generally didn’t engage with these suggestions. But at one point in late 2015, he told a New York Times reporter that he could produce “photos [sic] of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  Later in the same email string, Epstein also alluded to a woman he claimed both he and Trump had dated in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  “my 20 year old girlfriend in 1993, , that after two years i gave to donald,” Epstein said, linking to a webpage featuring the woman.\n \n\n   \n  A previously published lewd 2003 birthday album for Epstein’s 50th birthday alluded to a similar situation. It included a joke about Epstein having  sold “a ‘fully depreciated’ woman to Donald Trump.” \n \n\n   \n  Trump says the documents are a “hoax” and has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:12:00Z","title":"Johnson says House will vote next week on push to compel DOJ to release all of its Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has announced a vote on a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files, following a discharge petition filed by Republicans Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna. The vote is set for next week, earlier than expected, reflecting mounting pressure from within the GOP, especially from members like Tim Burchett and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who believe the delay undermines accountability.

House will vote next week on push to compel DOJ to release all of its Epstein files \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Manu Raju, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:12 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson announced Wednesday that he would put a ﻿contentious bill compelling the release of all of the Justice Department’s Jeffrey Epstein case files to a vote on the House floor next week – earlier than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said, adding, “in the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson was required to soon put the bill from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, on the floor after the pair  successfully deployed an arcane tool  in the chamber known as a discharge petition. But he had some leeway to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican leaders’ suggestion that he would move more quickly than expected to put the bill before the full House is a reflection of the growing sense of agitation among members of his party on Capitol Hill. The House GOP – which is fiercely loyal to Trump – is not eager to take the vote, which goes against the president’s own wishes. But many members of the party are also sick of the months of growing pressure from some vocal members of their own party, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and feel they need to vote in favor of releasing the files or risk being accused of protecting pedophiles.\n \n\n   \n  “Just get it to the daggum floor and let the people decide,” a frustrated Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told reporters after he went rogue earlier in the day, taking to the House floor to try to force an expedited vote on the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m tired of messing around. The Democrats have had the Epstein files for four years, and now we’ve got it for nine months, and it’s going to be dragged into a bunch of nonsense. Let’s just take it to the floor. Let’s vote on it. Let’s get on with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The congressman’s push was denied because it did not follow the proper parliamentary procedure.\n \n\n   \n  Political pressure over that high-profile Epstein vote roared back to life on the Hill Wednesday, with House members return to Washington after more than a month away.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva’s afternoon swearing in as the House’s newest member delivered the decisive vote to the discharge petition to force a vote, despite GOP leadership’s opposition and an apparent eleventh-hour  pressure campaign  by the White House to avoid it altogether.\n \n\n   \n  As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up on the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require. But Massie and Khanna used the discharge petition because House GOP leadership did not want the bill to get a vote – leaving many expecting they would have to wait seven legislative days to circumvent leadership and come to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  While the floor schedule for next week has not yet been set, Johnson said leadership wants to bring up the measure “as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a totally pointless exercise. It’s completely moot now. We might as well just do it. I mean, they have 218 signatures, that’s fine, we’ll do it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The House Committee on Oversight Committee on Wednesday released an additional 20,000 pages of documents the GOP-led panel had received from the late convicted sex offender’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In emails released as part of the tranche, Epstein, whose death by suicide has spawned intense scrutiny of the high-profile people he knew, mentioned Donald Trump by name multiple times in private correspondence over the last 15 years with an associate and an author in Trump’s orbit – details seized on by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson, however, brushed aside the  newly public details  when asked about them earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a massive distraction by the Democrats while we’re trying to get the government reopened and cover for their mistakes. I find it interesting that the press corps didn’t ask all these questions for four years during the Biden administration,” Johnson said, when asked whether he had any concerns about the new findings.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed by CNN why Congress shouldn’t release all Epstein documents when the president himself has said he supports doing so, Johnson said: “He is for maximum transparency. He said it as recently as a couple of days ago, and I talked to him about it today. He’s for everything coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Epstein-related pressure builds, two more House Republicans — GOP Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Eli Crane of Arizona — said they plan to vote for the bill to release the files when it comes to the floor. Neither had signed the discharge petition.\n \n\n   \n  Other Republicans, however, remain staunchly opposed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a vote against,” Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “My understanding and I’ve looked into it extensively is that the president didn’t like that guy, he had no friendly relationships with him. You can’t control who takes a picture with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/takeaways-epstein-emails-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"20:03:00-05:00","title":"Takeaways from the new Epstein emails mentioning Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The release of three emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, obtained by the House Oversight Committee, reignites public scrutiny over former President Donald Trump’s relationship with Epstein.

\n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:03 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal government shutdown provided  President Donald Trump  a weekslong reprieve from major revelations about his relationship with  Jeffrey Epstein .\n \n\n   \n  But as Congress looks to reopen the government this week, it’s clear Trump’s Epstein problem hasn’t gone away.\n \n\n   \n  The big news Wednesday morning was that House Oversight Committee Democrats released  three emails obtained from Epstein’s estate that mention Trump . Those emails came amid another huge release from the GOP-led committee of Epstein documents that  CNN is still reviewing .\n \n\n   \n  In one 2011 email, Epstein describes Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” He writes that someone who Democrats identify as an Epstein victim (but whose name is redacted in the released email) “spent hours at my house with him,” apparently referring to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans on the committee have since said the redacted victim who supposedly spent time with Trump  is Virginia Giuffre , one of Epstein’s most prominent survivors, who died by suicide in April. (Giuffre never implicated Trump in any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2019 email, Epstein appears to reflect on Trump asking Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell to stop recruiting employees from Mar-a-Lago. In the email, Epstein says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  And in a 2015 email, Epstein writes to author Michael Wolff about how Trump might handle questions about his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  (You can  see the emails for yourself here .)\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in the Epstein case and has denied involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The White House on Wednesday said the emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  But what do these emails add to our understanding of their past relationship? Let’s break it down.\n \n\n   \n    Emails reignite questions about what Trump knew and when\n \n\n   \n  There have remained huge unanswered questions about  what Trump knew and when about Epstein’s proclivities . That’s especially given Trump’s explanations have often  proved evasive or false .\n \n\n   \n  The White House responded to the initial three emails mentioning Trump by arguing Democrats had “selectively leaked” the emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  But these emails certainly deepen the intrigue about what Trump knew.\n \n\n   \n  To recap what we already knew: Trump in 2002 referred to how Epstein  liked women “on the younger side.”  A Florida businessman said in a 2019 interview that he raised concerns with Trump about Epstein “ going after younger girls ” at a 1992 “calendar girl” event. Trump adviser Roger Stone in a 2016 book quoted Trump talking about how Epstein’s “swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls” and joking that it was nice of Epstein to “ let the neighborhood kids use his pool .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his aides have also repeatedly said Trump distanced himself from Epstein because Epstein was a “creep” — but without elaborating on why, precisely, Trump viewed him as such.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, Trump this summer acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees, including Giuffre, at Mar-a-Lago — but he seemed to be  quite reluctant to go into detail .\n \n\n   \n  The question from there was whether Trump had an inkling about what Giuffre was being  recruited for .\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he didn’t “know really why” Maxwell was recruiting people. (Maxwell has denied recruiting people.) But Giuffre was a minor. To the extent Trump was aware of the particulars of the situation — and was aware of Epstein’s taste for young females — that would seem to raise red flags.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal actions,” Giuffre’s two brothers and her sisters-in-law said in  a statement  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  The 2019 Epstein email released by the committee says of Trump: “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t prove Trump knew what Maxwell and Epstein were recruiting the girls for. But it suggests that Trump was involved in telling Maxwell to knock it off and was seemingly familiar with the details of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 Epstein email that suggests Giuffre “spent hours” at his house with Trump also adds to the relevant facts here.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was acknowledging his awareness of Maxwell’s recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, he initially said he didn’t know if it was Giuffre who had been recruited. But then he quickly said that it was indeed her.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump actually spent time with Giuffre, as Epstein’s email seems to say, it would not only raise questions about why. It would also make Trump’s handling of the situation appear even more bizarre.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s clear from Giuffre’s own memoir that they knew each other and had had conversations about her working for his friends. “Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there,” Giuffre writes about the time that her father took her to meet Trump in his office. She goes on to recount that Trump asked her if she liked children and explained that he had friends in houses “next to the resort” who needed babysitting for their kids.\n \n\n   \n    The emails undercut Maxwell’s attempts to distance Trump from Epstein\n \n\n   \n  The Trump Justice Department decided to interview Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, this summer while her appeals were ongoing. It did so  despite  her established credibility problems and motivations to say what the administration wanted.\n \n\n   \n  (Trump at the time hadn’t ruled out the possibility of pardoning Maxwell. And around this time, we also learned Maxwell had been moved to a lower-security prison camp for which she didn’t appear eligible as a sex offender. The administration still hasn’t explained how this happened, months later.)\n \n\n   \n  And sure enough, Maxwell said things that were helpful to the president.  She basically said she had no knowledge of any Trump wrongdoing and downplayed his relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But the new emails call her claims into question.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of Trump’s and Epstein’s relationship, Maxwell said in her testimony, the transcript of which was released in August: “I don’t think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of — I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.”\n \n\n   \n  But the newly released emails suggest Maxwell was aware of Trump being at Epstein’s house, at least as of 2011.\n \n\n   \n  After Epstein in the email referenced someone spending “hours at my house” with Trump, Maxwell responds, “I have been thinking about that.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first Maxwell claim from that interview that has been  called into question .\n \n\n   \n    Epstein and Maxwell seemed to think this information about Trump was significant\n \n\n   \n  We surely need to learn more about the context of these emails. But one of the biggest takeaways is that they suggest Epstein and Maxwell seemed to feel this information about Trump was significant. There’s even a hint they suggested that information could be used as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  The timelines are important here.\n \n\n   \n  The 2011 email came as news was blowing up about Epstein’s ties to Prince Andrew, as he was then known. (He was recently  stripped of his noble title .) As CNN has reported, around this time Epstein  seemed to be going into legal attack mode .\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s most prominent accuser was Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context that Epstein and Maxwell conversed about Trump having spent time at Epstein’s house with someone who, according to Republicans, is identified in the email as Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, Epstein described Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” This is an expression that comes from   Sherlock Holmes mysteries ; it basically means the absence of an expected event.\n \n\n   \n  Which leads to the obvious question: Why might Epstein and Maxwell have expected  news about Trump to have come out?\n \n\n   \n  (Years later, in June 2019, Epstein seemed willing to laugh about it in an email exchange with a redacted individual, who a source confirmed is Trump’s former White House strategist Steve Bannon. Epstein described a meeting between then-President Trump and Prince Andrew at a state visit as “Tooo funny,” adding, “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago.” Bannon replied, “Can’t believe nobody is making u the connective tissue.“)\n \n\n   \n  The timeline of the 2019 email about Trump and Maxwell is also relevant. That’s because it came during Trump’s first term as his administration was weighing significant action vis-à-vis Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The Miami Herald had in late 2018 run a major exposé on the sweetheart deal Epstein received from US Attorney Alexander Acosta, who later became Trump’s labor secretary. By early 2019, a major question was whether the Justice Department would probe that deal.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ’s inspector general  said on January 30  of that year that he didn’t have the power to examine the situation. But  by February 6  the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility signaled that it had opened an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported at the time that multiple authorities were reviewing allegations about Epstein and minors  as of early that year .\n \n\n   \n  It was in this context, on January 31, that Epstein emailed Wolff about Trump “of course” being aware of Maxwell’s recruitment at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  The newly released emails also include a 2015 Epstein exchange with Wolff in which the two of them strategize about how then-candidate Trump should handle questions about his ties to Epstein. Wolff said he had heard CNN was going to ask Trump about it at the debate, either on air or after. (There is no mention of Epstein in the transcript of the debate.)\n \n\n   \n  In that email, Wolff suggests the best course would be to “let him hang himself” by denying being on Epstein’s plane or his house.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I know how dirty Donald is’: Several suggestions about what Epstein knew about Trump\n \n\n   \n  The newly released documents don’t provide any smoking guns when it comes to evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. But there are suggestions throughout that Epstein knew things about Trump that could hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  In one 2018 email, Epstein remarked amid a discussion about Trump’s possible impeachment: “you see , i know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. What it means to have your fixer flip.” (That last part was apparently a reference to Michael Cohen, who flipped on Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, a correspondent wondered to Epstein about “the stories you could tell,” according to one of the released email exchanges. After the correspondent wagered that such information might not actually damage Trump, Epstein seemed to reference how Trump was “a phony rich person.”\n \n\n   \n  Epstein told the same person months earlier that he could produce photos “of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.”\n \n\n   \n  He also told the person that he at one point “gave” his 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump, in the mid-1990s.\n \n\n   \n  At other points in Epstein’s correspondence, Wolff seems to try and convince Epstein to come forward and say something about Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner your great sympathy and help finish him,” Wolff told Epstein days before the 2016 election. “Interested?”\n \n\n   \n    Trump is still feeding perceptions of a cover-up\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s reactions to the new documents Wednesday aren’t going to do anything to tamp down perceptions that Trump is trying to keep stuff like this hidden.\n \n\n   \n  CNN exclusively  reported  that the White House held a Situation Room meeting Wednesday with a key GOP lawmaker who’s signed onto an effort to force a House vote on releasing the full Epstein files, using what’s known as a  discharge petition  – something the White House wants to stop.\n \n\n   \n  That petition got a decisive 218th signature Wednesday from a new Democratic member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP lawmaker, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, later thanked White House officials for meeting with her in a post on X, writing, “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is also reporting Trump has  played phone tag  with another of the four Republican signatories, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. (She later said in a statement, “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”)\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s response to Oversight Democrats releasing emails that mention him was to publicly pressure Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap” on Epstein, Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else …”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional takeaways.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/australia-ancient-crocodile-hunting-trees-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:40:00-05:00","title":"Ancient eggshells shed new light on crocodiles that hunted prey from trees","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have discovered Australia’s oldest known crocodile eggshells, belonging to mekosuchine crocodiles that lived 55 million years ago.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have unearthed Australia’s oldest known crocodile eggshells, a discovery that could shed light on ancient reptiles that may have hunted prey by dropping on them from trees.\n \n\n   \n  The eggshells belonged to mekosuchine crocodiles, a prehistoric creature that dominated Australian waters 55 million years ago — a long time before the arrival of saltwater and freshwater crocs on the continent around 3.8 million years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Paleontologist Michael Archer said mekosuchine crocodiles could grow to at least 5 meters (around 16 feet) long, and some hunted from trees. Australian researchers have dubbed them “drop crocs,” a reference to the feared “drop bear” — the vicious, carnivorous cousin of the country’s beloved koalas,  or so the legend goes .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a bizarre idea. But some of them appear to have been terrestrial hunters in the forests,” said Archer, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who took part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “They were perhaps hunting like leopards — dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner,” ﻿he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  A team of international scientists, led by Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont   in Barcelona, dug up the fossils from a rancher’s backyard in southeast Queensland and studied them .  They reported their findings Tuesday in the  Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .\n \n\n   \n  The ancient crocodile eggshells are helping scientists to understand the anatomy of these reptiles, as well as their reproduction patterns and adaptability, the study’s lead author, Xavier Panadès i Blas, said.\n \n\n   \n  “They preserve microstructural and geochemical signals that tell us not only what kinds of animals laid them, but also where they nested and how they bred,” he said   in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Mekosuchine crocs are believed to have become extinct in Australia around 3,000 years ago. They may have lost much of their inland habitat due to encroaching dryland, a situation compounded by growing competition with other predators and the dwindling amount of prey, said co-author Michael Stein, a research associate at the University of New South Wales.\n \n\n   \n    A backyard trove\n \n\n   \n  The exact location of the discovery is a small town called Murgon, about three and a half hours’ drive from Brisbane, the capital of Queensland.\n \n\n   \n  Archer said he and his colleagues had been excavating there since 1983, and he could still recall how it all began.\n \n\n   \n  “UNSW colleague Henk Godhelp and I drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The residents “grinned and said ‘of course’” after hearing their homes were sitting on some prehistoric treasures, Archer recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we’ve already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s inherently difficult to identify an extinct species based on   an eggshell, said Dean Lomax, a paleontologist and author of “ The Secret Lives of Dinosaurs  — Unearthing the  Real  Behaviors of Prehistoric Animals.” He wasn’t involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  However, given that the eggshell was found in the same geological deposits and locality of the only known mekosuchine fossils from that period of time, Lomax said the authors made a solid argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of the key things here is that matching the fossil egg shells and the croc that laid them can provide new information,” he said. “It will help us to understand not only how they reproduced and where they laid their eggs, but the connection may help shed light on the lifestyle of these unusual crocs.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/epstein-files-discharge-petition-next-steps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:38:00-05:00","title":"Epstein Files Petition Now Has Its 218th Signature.

Under the arcane procedure, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign one, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky joined with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to spearhead this particular discharge petition, but while Grijalva provided the decisive signature, the effort faces a number of hurdles — and the bill is unlikely to become law.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, should it pass the House, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump, who has derided the effort. But the House vote would put lawmakers on the record on the issue, forcing Republicans in particular to choose between siding with Trump or backing the release of files that could shine new light on the crimes of the convicted sex offender.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the steps the House will have to take now that Grijalva has become the 218th signature:\n \n\n   \n    How long does it take to ‘ripen’?\n \n\n   \n  Even with Grijalva’s signature, an additional seven legislative days have to lapse before a member can move to bring the petition to the floor. The week is often referred to as the “ripening” period.\n \n\n   \n  Then, House Speaker Mike Johnson has up to two legislative days to schedule a vote. (But again, calendar days don’t always equal legislative days – the House must be in session.)\n \n\n   \n  That appeared to make the first week of December the earliest the House could actually begin considering a vote to release the Epstein files on the House floor. But in a surprise, Johnson said early Wednesday evening he’d put the measure on the floor next week. As speaker of the House, Johnson can bring any bill up to the floor at any time, regardless of what the rules require.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n    Can GOP leadership delay or dodge the effort?\n \n\n   \n  If he wanted to, Johnson does have a few maneuvers at his disposal to try to delay or derail the process, including an attempt to table a final vote on the matter or referring it to a committee. But Johnson’s saying the bill will come to the floor next week shows that he wants to bring this up for a vote.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker has previously indicated that if the petition gets 218 signatures, he will allow for a vote. “If they get their signatures, it goes to a vote,” Johnson told reporters last month.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson also called the effort a “moot point” on CNN earlier this week, citing the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein-related investigation and release of thousands of pages of documents.\n \n\n   \n  Assuming the process moves forward, the House would then have to take a series of procedural votes with hours of debate on the House floor before the bill would receive a final vote.\n \n\n   \n  And then, after all that, the bill would still need to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate – a dubious prospect – where 60 votes would be needed for it to advance, if it even got a vote.\n \n\n   \n    Will the Senate consider the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Even if Massie’s bill clears the House, there’s no guarantee it would get a vote in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether the Senate should vote on the bill, the Republican leader said he was “not sure what that achieves.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to force a vote in September on a bill calling for the release of the files, but Senate Republicans killed the measure — with all but two Republicans voting to derail it.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97660","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-05:01","title":"Can you ace this week's test?

Lauren Boebert.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that show the level of transparency when we are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns?” she told reporters at the press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt added: “I’m not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n  A source familiar confirmed the meeting in the Situation Room included Boebert, who has wanted the Justice Department to release its trove of Epstein files and has signed onto the effort in the House to force the vote compelling their release.\n \n\n   \n  That effort is now in motion after a newly sworn-in Democratic member of Congress provided the 218th – and final – signature needed on the discharge petition to force such a vote and, in turn, trigger a number of procedural steps before the House can vote on a bill compelling the files’ release.\n \n\n   \n  After the meeting, Boebert wrote on X, “I want to thank White House officials for meeting with me today. Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  She later told CNN’s Manu Raju that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off of the discharge petition and that while Epstein came up in the White House meeting, other topics were also covered.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, President Donald Trump and Rep. Nancy Mace, another Republican who’s signed the petition, had been playing phone tag for the past 24 hours. The South Carolina Republican sent a direct message to the president Wednesday outlining why she’s supporting the discharge petition, according to a source familiar with the message who said it largely mirrored a public statement in which she said: “I will NEVER abandon other survivors.”\n \n\n   \n  But both the meeting and Trump’s efforts to talk to Mace underscored the administration’s concerns around the Epstein saga, which roared back Wednesday morning when the House Oversight Committee released more documents it had obtained from Epstein’s estate. (Leavitt said Wednesday the emails from that trove that mention Trump  “prove absolutely nothing.” )\n \n\n   \n  Besides Boebert and Mace, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is the other Republican who’s signed onto the petition from Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, to force the vote on the release of the files on the House floor. The pair received the 218th decisive signature from Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva Wednesday afternoon,  allowing the push to force a vote to move forward. \n \n\n   \n  Had anyone removed their name from the petition before reaching 218, Massie and Khanna would have no longer had the support needed to move forward.\n \n\n   \n  Under the arcane procedure of a House discharge petition, if 218 members of the House – a majority of all 435 districts – sign on, they can force a floor vote in the chamber on anything — even if leadership opposes it. Such an effort rarely succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  The unreleased Justice Department files, which capture years of investigation into child sex trafficking, could include details the House hasn’t obtained.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the White House meeting, one source said it would also include Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi was seen leaving the White House at 1:10pm ET on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The controversy around Epstein and his contacts with other powerful people, including Trump, has divided the Republican Party in recent months, with Boebert being among the Republican House members publicly pushing for more transparency around the case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump hasn’t been accused of any crime, and longtime Epstein contact and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell previously told Blanche in an interview this summer that she had seen no wrongdoing,  including by Trump.  \n \n\n   \n  At least two women who say they are survivors of Epstein’s abuse were expected to attend Grijalva’s swearing-in ceremony Wednesday afternoon, sources with knowledge told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The House effort to compel the release of the files, should it pass, would still have to pass the GOP-led Senate and be signed into law by Trump, who has derided the effort.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608348","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Economic Promises Helped Trump Get Elected.

Now he has an affordability problem \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump says he is going to \"make America affordable again.\" It's a pledge he made frequently during the campaign. And now, after dropping it from his lexicon for more than eight months, he's saying it again as polls show voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concern and  blame Trump's policies  for making things worse. A senior administration official tells NPR Trump will soon travel around the country with a message that while some things have improved, there is more work to do to help people feeling economic strain. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, added that when it comes to affordability, \"there's no finish line.\" Thus far, Trump has spent far more time boasting about how great the economy and stock market are doing than acknowledging any economic anxiety. \"Record high, record high, record high,\" Trump said of the stock market last week at a business event in Florida. \"Costs are way down,\" Trump said at a late night signing ceremony in the Oval Office Wednesday. \"My administration and our partners in Congress will continue our work to lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy and make America affordable again for all Americans.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's affordability challenge marks a dramatic reversal of fortune for a president who returned to office on a promise to bring costs down and whose greatest political strength was on the economy. Now his approval rating on the economy is severely underwater. After sweeping wins by Democrats in last week's elections where the cost-of-living was a key issue, Trump suddenly had a lot to say about \"affordability.\" But he has frequently come across as dismissive and defensive. \"The affordability is much better with the Republicans,\" Trump said last week. \"The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.\" But earlier this week when Fox News' Laura Ingraham pressed Trump on rising costs of things like coffee and ground beef, he called it a \"con job by the Democrats.\" Asked why people are anxious about the economy, Trump responded by questioning whether people really are saying that. \"I think polls are fake,\" Trump said. \"We have the greatest economy we've ever had.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       To support his positive outlook, Trump points to the booming stock market, his tariff policy and pledges by companies and countries to invest in the U.S. Inflation this year has been persistent but not dramatic, at about 3%. Eggs have gotten cheaper since Trump took office, but other staples like ground beef and coffee are up. According to  Gas Buddy , the average price of gasoline in the U.S. is $3.09 per gallon, slightly higher than this time last year. \"Consumer confidence is the lowest it's ever been,\" said Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard. \"People are really negative about inflation.\" It's a political truth — and a pitfall for presidents — that people don't want to hear that everything is awesome if they are struggling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Furman, who served in the Obama administration, says the messaging team in that White House was very cautious not to brag about the economy, as the nation emerged from the Great Recession. \"Because they thought anything we said positive about the economy risked people thinking President Obama was out of touch,\" said Furman. \"I didn't see that type of reserve when Biden was president. He bragged about it quite a lot, and I think that [rang] hollow with a lot of people. And President Trump is even less reserved about his bragging.\" Trump's insistence that the economy is great earned him a rebuke from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Appearing on  the Sean Spicer Show on YouTube , Greene said she gives Trump credit for holding inflation steady. \"But that doesn't bring prices down,\" said Greene. \"And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping. It's actually infuriating people because people know what they are paying at the grocery store, they know what they're paying for their kid's clothes and school supplies. They know what they're paying for their electricity bills.\" She called for compassion rather than lecturing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore says there are three major cost issues that have to be addressed: grocery prices, home prices and health care costs. \"It is true factually that the average family has more purchasing power today than they did when Biden left office,\" said Moore. \"And yet people don't feel it. You know, they're not feeling the love. And I can't explain why that is except that people tend to focus on things where their prices are rising.\" In fact, purchasing power also grew during the Biden administration, because wages rose faster than costs. But voters didn't want to hear it then, and they are in no mood to hear it now. \"People are kind of in a crabby mood right now when it comes to the economy,\" said Moore. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melissa-hortman-death-vance-boelter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00Z","title":"Prosecutors turn over 130,000 pages of evidence in the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major political and criminal case, Vance Boelter, a 58-year-old politically conservative evangelical, is charged with the murders of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, and state Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette.

Harry Jacobs told the court that investigators have provided substantially all of the evidence they have collected against Vance Boelter. He’s  pleaded not guilty  to murder in the killing of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and to attempted murder in the shootings of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Some evidence, such as lab reports, continues to come in.\n \n\n   \n  Federal defender Manny Atwal said at the status conference that the evidence includes over 130,000 pages of PDF documents, over 800 hours of audio and video recordings, and over 2,000 photographs from what authorities have called the largest hunt for a suspect in Minnesota history.\n \n\n   \n  Atwal said her team has spent close to 110 hours just downloading the material — not reviewing it — and that they’re still evaluating the evidence, a process she said has gone slowly due to the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s not unusual for a complex case but it is lot of information for us to review,” Atwal told Magistrate Judge Dulce Foster.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said he didn’t have a timeline for when the Department of Justice would decide whether to  seek the death penalty  against Boelter.

day of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago area \n       \n  By Zoe Sottile, Sarah Dewberry, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:06 PM EST, Wed November 12, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling  Thursday limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Thursday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/louisville-ups-plane-crash-victims","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"18:57:00Z","title":"All 14 victims identified from fiery UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tragic incident on November 4, 2025, a UPS cargo plane crashed during takeoff at Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, killing 14 people.

And if they don't take the hint the first time, you can be direct. 'Is this catching your attention so much that you have to say something right now?' I think you can give someone one pass with a little joke to let them know you don't like it. And then after that, be really direct. Adia Gooden:  I agree.  If people continue to cross this boundary, be more serious about it. You can say, 'It's not cool. I'm not comfortable with it. Please stop.' If somebody feels a little embarrassed and realizes they shouldn't have said that, that's OK. You're not saying they're an awful person, but you're communicating that what they did is problematic. They should feel a little taste of it so that they stop. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dear Life Kit, I've been with my boyfriend for seven years. I'm starting to feel pressure from family members and friends to settle down and have a wedding. We're planning to get married, but we want to wait until we are more financially secure. How can I let people know we're not in a hurry to get married without being rude? —  Not in a hurry Gooden:  If people are coming from a loving place, just say, 'We're being really intentional about how we want to start the next chapter of our lives together. Weddings are expensive. We don't want to start our lives together in debt or going into debt.' Luse:   When I was in a similar situation, I would say, 'If you've got tens of thousands of dollars that you want to give me, go right ahead.' Or the other, mildly gentler, response, 'I don't have any updates to share right now, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.' Which is what I say now when people ask me about having children. Gooden:  [If a lighter touch doesn't work,] you can just say, 'Please stop asking us. It's kind of frustrating when you keep asking us about our plans. We will be sure to let you know when we are going in that direction, but until then, please respect our decision-making.' \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dear Life Kit, My future sister-in-law often says things that are hurtful or judgmental. She once told me, 'I love you, but you're too self-absorbed to own a dog.' And this was over a meal that I brought over for her. I've had pets, raised my younger sister and taken care of my sick mom. I don't think most people would consider me self-absorbed. Her comments bring my fiancé and me down. I've begun avoiding her. How can I cope in a healthy way and still have a relationship with her? —  Feeling frozen? Gooden:  This might be a situation where you need to recognize when someone's comments are not about you. If you know that you're not self-absorbed, then you shouldn't let somebody's comment derail you or override what you know to be true about yourself. So, how do you stay grounded in who you are? You need to discern whose opinion you're going to take and whose opinion you're going to leave. If your wise grandma says, 'Hey, it seems like you've been focusing on yourself a little too much, and I want you to think about this.' That might be different than a comment from a sister-in-law who tends to make judgmental comments. She may be somebody whose opinion you're going to ignore. You may also need to set some boundaries. For example, 'Hey, I feel judged when you give me advice. So I prefer that not to be part of our relationship.' Luse:  At the end of the day, this is your fiancé's sister, and I wonder if he could play a bigger role in managing your relationship with her as a couple. It sounds like maybe he's also feeling the impact of her judgment. I'll share something my therapist said to me once when I was navigating a difficult relationship: 'Have you ever considered that this person may never change? I want you to consider that, and then think about how you want to conduct yourself going forward.' You can't control her. You can only control how and when you interact with her, to a certain degree.

1:42 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a judge Thursday to dismiss the cases against them, saying the prosecutor who secured the indictments was illegally installed in the role. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. That decision could help determine the fate of the politically charged cases, which were both shepherded by the hastily installed Halligan and together have amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being used as a weapon to target President Donald Trump's perceived adversaries. Halligan was installed in the job at Trump's urging by Attorney General Pam Bondi in September, just days before Comey was indicted, in what defense lawyers say was an end-run around the constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of U.S. attorneys. They say the maneuver was designed to ensure indictments against the president's political opponents after the prosecutor who had been overseeing the two investigations, but had not brought charges, was effectively forced out. \"Ms. Halligan was the sole prosecutor in the grand jury room, and when the sole prosecutor lacks the authority,\" said Ephraim McDowell, one of Comey's defense lawyers, \"that's not going to be a harmless error.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. attorneys, top federal prosecutors who oversee regional Justice Department outposts across the country, are typically nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate. Attorneys general do have the authority to name an interim U.S. attorney who can serve for 120 days, but lawyers for Comey and James argued that once that period expires, the law gives federal judges the exclusive say of who gets to fill the vacancy. The interim US attorney resigned under pressure After then-interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned in September while facing Trump administration pressure to bring charges against Comey and James, Bondi installed Halligan, a White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience. The appointment followed a Trump post on Truth Social in which he complained to Bondi about the lack of prosecutorial action against his political enemies and said, \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" Siebert had been appointed by Bondi in January to serve as interim U.S. attorney. Trump in May announced his intention to nominate him, and judges in the Eastern District unanimously agreed after his 120-day period expired that he should be retained in the role. But after the Trump administration effectively pushed him out in September, the Justice Department again opted to make an interim appointment in place of the courts, something defense lawyers say it was not empowered under the law to do. \"If the government were to prevail here,\" McDowell said, then it \"would never need to go through Senate confirmation again for U.S. attorneys.\" He said any dismissal of the indictment must be permanent, with no opportunity to bring the case again, to avoid rewarding the government for a violation. The Justice Department defends Halligan's appointment The Justice Department maintains that the law does not explicitly prohibit successive appointments of interim U.S. attorneys by the attorney general. Henry Whitaker, a lawyer for the department, argued that the indictment was properly returned by a grand jury and should not be dismissed over what he described as at most a paperwork or clerical error. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The grand jury made a decision based on the facts and the law, and they followed their oath,\" Whitaker said. He also said that even if there were questions about Halligan's appointment, they were resolved by the fact that Bondi had personally ratified the indictment and reviewed the grand jury proceedings. But Currie, the judge, questioned whether that was possible given that a section of the grand jury proceedings that were produced to her was, for unexplained reasons, missing a section. A Justice Department spokesperson later said that there was no missing time and that the time period in question concerns when the grand jury was deliberating, which \"would not be included in a transcription.\" Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, and James, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations. The challenges to Halligan's appointment are part of a multiprong effort to get the prosecutions tossed before trial. Their lawyers have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president's personal animus toward their clients and should therefore be dismissed. Trump's history with Comey and James Comey, as FBI director in the early months of Trump's first term, infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries since, with Comey labeling Trump \"unethical\" and comparing him to a Mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an \"untruthful slime ball\" and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against him and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607812","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00-05:00","title":"The government shutdown is over, but not everything is back to normal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days, has ended after President Trump signed a bill passed by Congress.

PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The  longest government shutdown  in U.S. history is officially over after President  Trump signed a bill  passed by Congress on Wednesday night. The federal government is reopening. But after 43 days on pause, things may not return to business as usual right away. For instance, federal workers are still awaiting backpay and air travel disruptions are expected to linger. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS). There's also the looming threat of another potential shutdown in the not-too-distant future, since this bill only funds the government through Jan. 30. Here's a look at where things stand for now. Keep scrolling for updates, and jump by category here: Federal workers  |  SNAP |  Smithsonian  |  Air travel  |  National parks  |  Taxes  |  Economic data Federal employees return to work, awaiting back pay  Roughly 1.4 million federal workers have gone without pay for six weeks. Roughly half of them were required to keep working without paychecks, while hundreds of thousands of others were furloughed. Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday. \"Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner\" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a  Wednesday memo . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The timing of backpay is a different question. After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress  passed a law  ensuring back pay for federal workers \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\" But Trump appeared to  suggest otherwise  in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were  paused by a federal judge , and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January. Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an  Instagram video  that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days. \"Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,\" he says of the last shutdown. \"A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.\" SNAP is back  The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026. The program, which some  42 million Americans rely on  for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and  extended that pause again  on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight). At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as  NPR has reported , many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again. Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual. Its  website says  the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday. All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved  live animal cams  — will reopen to the public \"on a rolling basis\" by Monday. Air travel won't bounce back overnight The shutdown snarled air travel in a tangle that experts say is beyond a quick fix. Escalating shortages of air traffic controllers — who have been required to work without pay — caused delays and disruptions at airports nationwide since early October. Then, last week, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to  reduce air traffic  at 40 of the country's busiest airports, starting by 4% and ramping up to 10% by this Friday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The FAA  announced Wednesday  that it would freeze flight reductions at the current 6% level, citing a rapid improvement in controller staffing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers will get a lump sum payment equal to 70% of their  back pay within 48 hours  of the shutdown ending. The agency says it will continue to assess \"whether the system can gradually return to normal operations.\" Airlines and aviation regulators have warned that flight  disruptions are likely to continue  once the government reopens. Airlines had to adjust their schedules to reduce flights, and those changes can take time to reverse. \"It's going to take a bit to unwind, and the responsibility is not going to fall completely on the air traffic control operation,\" former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt  told NPR's  All Things Considered  on Tuesday. \"A good deal of responsibility will be the carriers getting their schedules and the aircraft and personnel back in the right positions to resume normal flying.\" Air travel experts have told NPR that even after the shutdown, lingering impacts could potentially complicate  Thanksgiving travel  — which is always a hectic time to fly. National Parks start to \"pick up the pieces\"     Most national parks  stayed at least partially open  during the shutdown, but with significantly reduced staffing (since thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed) and limited services like visitor centers and trash pickup. The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonprofit that advocates for national parks,  said in a statement  that it could take months for returning staff to address the damage. \"For 43 days, many national parks were left open, vulnerable and unprotected,\" said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at NPCA. \"The National Park Service, already pushed to its breaking point after losing 25% of permanent staff, is left to pick up the pieces.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       National parks were already feeling the strain before the shutdown,  forced by federal funding cuts  to cancel ranger programs, close visitors centers and pause maintenance and research. During the shutdown, parks were unable to collect millions of dollars in entrance and recreational fees, which Brengel says could delay construction projects and other visitor services. And nonprofits which diverted resources to help parks stay operational have depleted their budgets in the process, Brengel says, leaving them \"unsure if they will ever fully recover those funds.\" Congress' bill funds the National Park Service through January. But Brengel calls it \"only a short-term reprieve,\" warning that another government shutdown could dampen the busy season by affecting the hiring of seasonal rangers for next spring and summer. The IRS is looking ahead to tax filing season The IRS  furloughed nearly half  of its approximately 74,000 workers and tried to lay off  roughly 1,400 others  — though those cuts were reversed as a result of the bill reopening the government. The agency's operations were  limited during the shutdown . It generally did not pay tax refunds during this period, scaled back its live telephone customer service supports, closed walk-in Taxpayer Assistance Centers and cancelled appointments related to cases with the Independent Office of Appeals and Taxpayer Advocate Service — which it says will be rescheduled once the government reopens. Tax deadlines and laws remain in effect, and the IRS says it has continued critical operations related to next year's tax-filing season. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But some experts worry that the effects of the shutdown — on top of thousands of  IRS job cuts  enacted earlier this year — could make for a messy 2026 tax season. In an  October letter  to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) urged the IRS to take steps like pausing notice and collection activities during the shutdown. It wrote that since taxpayers can only respond to those by mail, the understaffed agency may not see their letters in time to fix errors or address issues — and will have to deal with an unwieldy backlog when the government reopens. \"This burden has the real potential to delay the 2026 filing season due to the increased stresses to our entire tax system,\" the accountants wrote. Such disruptions have happened before. The 2018-2019 shutdown left the IRS with over 5 million pieces of unprocessed mail, 80,000 unaddressed responses to Fiscal Year 2018 Earned Income Tax Credit audits and 87,000 amended returns waiting to be processed,  according to a report  by the National Taxpayer Advocate (an independent agency within the IRS). And years earlier, the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 delayed billions of dollars of tax refunds and created a backlog of 1.2 million income and Social Security number verification requests, according to the  Committee for a Responsible Budget . Delayed economic reports may never be released The shutdown could leave permanent gaps in economic data. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics typically releases employment reports on the first Friday of each month, a practice that was paused in October and November. Even with the government reopening, their future is uncertain. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt  told reporters  on Wednesday that October's inflation and jobs reports will \"likely never [be] released and all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired.\" She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said \"may have permanently damaged the federal statistical system.\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not commented publicly on the status of the reports or updated its calendar of upcoming release dates. Economists  expect the bureau  to release its September jobs report (which was nearly ready when the government shut down on Oct. 1) first, and say it's an open question when — or whether — any October reports will be published. \n         \n         Correction \n         Nov. 13th, 2025 \n         An earlier version of this story featured a photo with incorrect caption information.

How to find what works for you and get outside \n         By Gabrielle Horton, Audrey Nguyen \n        \n           Tuesday, April 19, 2022 • 12:03 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Being \"outdoorsy\" can stir up images of big beautiful national parks, snowy slopes or lush, green forests. But smaller moments in nature, like walking my dog around the neighborhood or even listening to a rain sounds playlist as I fall asleep, have been just as valuable — and don't require the time, money or physical mobility of a big trip.  No matter how you access it, a  growing body of research  shows that nature has enormous emotional and cognitive benefits on people \"including improved attention, lower stress, better mood, reduced risk of psychiatric disorders and even upticks in empathy and cooperation,\" according to the American Psychological Association.  \n       \n      Related Story:  New To Camping? Here's How To Get Started \n       Whether you're gearing up for a backpacking trip or a virtual aquarium tour, here are five small steps you can take to get closer to nature: 1. Think of time in nature as a \"multivitamin\" — it's best to take it every day   Getting your daily dose of nature is vital to your well-being, says  Ming Kuo , who runs the  Landscape and Human Health Lab  at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \"Nature helps our mental muscles relax and recover,\" she explains. For example, if you're spending hours staring at a computer screen or reading something difficult, you might feel pretty exhausted afterward. \"If we get our breaks or even our micro restorative moments\" by getting outside, Kuo says, \"we recover some capacity to use that mental muscle so we can do things that are hard to do.\" And it's not just our brains that benefit from nature. Kuo says our immune systems need it, too. \"Our research suggests that it's not a luxury,\" says Kuo. \"It's actually what you need to function well. ... It's kind of like a multivitamin.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  Why does my plant look sad? 6 tips for raising happy houseplants  \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  North American birds are in decline. Here are 8 simple ways you can help \n       If you can't physically get outside, you can still access nature and reap the benefits: Take a break to  watch the birds  from your window or  tend to your houseplants .  \"Nature includes everything from 'capital N' beautiful, spectacular, untouched wilderness all the way to a window box,\" says Kuo. 2. Find your people Finding a crew who enjoys the same activities you do takes some of the pressure off trying to navigate the outdoors alone, and it's an important way to stay safe in more remote areas. In a world where we're constantly inundated with images of what an \"outdoorsy person\" should look like, finding your people might feel like a challenge.  Ash Manning  is a plus-size explorer who hasn't always felt welcomed on whitewater rafting excursions or overnight hikes. \"I think being bigger, it's always been like, 'Am I the only one doing this?' The answer is no, absolutely not,\" Manning says.  Eventually, the Appalachian native found  Unlikely Hikers , a nationwide hiking group for \"adventurers who are plus-size & fat, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, queer, trans and non-binary,  disabled , neurodivergent and beyond.\"  Looking to find your people? Check out groups like  Disabled Hikers ,  Black Men with Gardens ,  Fat Girls Hiking ,  Textured Waves  and more.  3. Bring the outdoors into your world Remember, you don't have to  be  outdoors to experience its wonder. We are a part of nature, and nature is a part of us — regardless of where we are.  Need a quick break from your \"work screen time\" for some \"fun screen time?\" There's a nature fix for that: Check out the  #FindThatLizard  game on  Twitter  and  Instagram . Science communicator and herpetologist  Earyn McGee  posts a picture of a lizard \"camouflaged in its natural environment, and people have to find the lizard in the photo.\" You don't even have to leave your couch to play.  Trying to get off screens? You can barbecue in your yard or the park, enjoy natural scents with an aromatherapy diffuser or open a window to get some fresh air. These are great options if you're living in a city, or if you're disabled, immunocompromised or on a budget. 4. Learn about the origins of \"our\" outdoors and celebrate Indigenous history  Before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, most people of color were  legally denied access to or segregated  at state and national parks. \"[Parks] were actually  designed  to be exclusive, so if you can't get to them, it's not your fault,\" McGee explains. That exclusion extends to the erasure of Indigenous peoples from these lands and the environmental movement at large.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Yellowstone turns 150. Here's a peek into the national park's history \n       Recognizing the Indigenous history of the land we're on can really ground our experiences in the outdoors, says Oregon State University (OSU) anthropologist  Spirit Brooks . As a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Brooks' focus is on \"shifting this dominant narrative of wilderness and conservation and those ideas being rooted in settler colonialism.\"  Learn about which tribes are local to you and \"the Indigenous place names in your area for streams, for mountains, for parks,\" Brooks says. Apps like  Native Land  and  Whose Land  are great places to start.  Ultimately, deepening our appreciation for nature, in whatever ways, is good for ourselves today and for future generations, too.

As a kid growing up in Los Angeles, I loved being outside. Making mud pies, doing cartwheels and collecting roly-polies were some of my favorite ways to enjoy the outdoors. But as I got older, something shifted, perhaps a mix of what I was seeing in magazines and on TV, plus other people's ideas of what makes someone an outdoorsy person. I started noticing that my love for the outdoors - well, it got complicated. It felt like only big-N nature mattered - you know, the national parks, ski trips, overnight camping, all fun things but activities that require a certain level of physical mobility, lots of travel time and, of course, money. While I could save up or plan for some of those bigger experiences here and there, I also realized just how deeply I felt about little-N nature - the smaller day-to-day moments that gave me a chance to bring nature in my way and with greater ease. And over the past two years, as we've all had to renegotiate our relationship with the outdoors, I've been thinking about this a lot. For this episode of LIFE KIT, I got a chance to talk to several nature enthusiasts about ways that all of us might find our footing outdoors. And as you can tell, it won't be a conversation just about sweeping wilderness views and weeklong safaris. It will include ways to honor Indigenous land practices, find an outdoor community group and even play your way through nature. In the fall of 2021, I embarked on one of my biggest big-N nature excursions yet. I headed off to Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. And to be honest, I've never been a national park girl, per se, but it was hard to deny the sheer beauty of it all. My time away in the Canadian Rockies was everything. But more than that, being out there, exploring new hiking trails - it just felt so good. And when I got back to LA, I found myself smiling and laughing more, going through my camera roll full of flowers, and I just couldn't shake this feeling. But the good news is that we don't have to go to Banff every weekend to reap these benefits because the thing is, nature is all around us, and it means something different to all of us. So I reached out to Ming Kuo, an associate professor of natural resources and environmental sciences to get her thoughts on it all. MING KUO: I define nature the way the scientific literature does, which is that originally, you know, when people studied nature, they were studying capital-N nature - wilderness. HORTON: At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Ming's research focuses on how being in green environments affects our quality of life and social behavior. And over the years, her work has expanded to create a much more comprehensive view of nature, too. KUO: Nature includes everything from capital-N beautiful, spectacular untouched wilderness all the way to a window box or having a view of squirrels from your office window or the little tiny bits of nature that are part of our potentially very urban lives. HORTON: So whether you're tapping into big- or small-N nature, professor Kuo shares that there are enormous benefits for our mind and body, which leads us to our first takeaway - nature is the ultimate multivitamin. So go out and get it. KUO: If you wanted to summarize all of my work - and really, a huge number of researchers' work - in a single sentence, it's that nature is an essential component of a healthy human habitat. HORTON: I know. You're probably like, human habitats? But people forget - we're animals, too. KUO: We know from ethology, the study of animals in the wild, the study of animals in zoos and in labs, that when animals are housed in settings that are appropriate to them, that fit them, they do better socially and psychologically and physically. And that's basically what we see with people. HORTON: Ming tests out this theory often in her own habitat. KUO: One thing I've done over the years because of my research (laughter) is that I walk to campus. It's about a 15-minute walk. And my neighborhood is tree-lined because I chose a place that was - with tree-lined streets. And I walk with my chin up and my eyes in the canopy, kind of flowing through the river of trees, both to and from campus. HORTON: But I was still curious, though. What exactly does nature do to the brain? Why is it so essential? KUO: One is that nature helps our mental muscle relax and recover. HORTON: For instance, if you're spending hours at a computer screen or reading something difficult, you're pretty exhausted afterwards. So there's a reason why you're encouraged to get some fresh air to give yourself a mental break. KUO: If we get our breaks or even our micro-restorative moments through the view outside, we recover some capacity to use that mental muscle so we can do things that are hard to do, and we can do them more easily and less painfully. HORTON: When we spoke, Professor Kuo also mentioned how pivotal nature is in building up our immune systems. And to put it simply, nature heals. It's not some add-on bonus. It's something we all need to make room for. KUO: But what our research suggests is that it's not a luxury. It's actually what you need to function well. It's kind of like a multivitamin. So you should get it (laughter) even if it's nice. You know, just because it's nice, doesn't mean you don't need it. HORTON: With all the benefits that nature has to offer us, why does it seem to be so hard to access it or that it's a luxury for a select few? Speaking with herpetologist and science communicator Earyn McGee really helped to put it all into perspective for me. EARYN MCGEE: I think the biggest thing to remember is you still count as an outdoors person and a nature person even if you can't get to these big national parks. They were not designed to be inclusive. They were actually designed to be exclusive. HORTON: Earyn's right. This history of exclusion from public recreational sites like state and national parks has had a big impact on how people like Earyn, a Black woman, even connect to the outdoors today. And don't worry, we'll get a chance to hear more from her later on. But prior to the 1964 civil rights bill, most people of color were legally denied access to or segregated at these outdoor sites, especially big national parks. But even before that, don't forget that these lands were originally stolen from Indigenous peoples. And as poet Karenne Wood reminds us, nothing was discovered. Everything was already loved. And this sentiment couldn't be more true for anthropologist Spirit Brooks. Her work considers how we can acknowledge the ancestral homelands we're hiking, running and living on. SPIRIT BROOKS: I think it kind of reframes our relationship to land and place, maybe in a different way than traditional approaches to, say, environmental education. So if we're emphasizing our relationship to land as a foundation for instruction or how we center the well-being and the futures of Indigenous nations, we're really sort of shifting this dominant narrative of wilderness and conservation and those ideas being kind of rooted in settler colonialism. HORTON: That leads us to our second takeaway - recognize the history of the land. It will truly ground your experiences in the outdoors. A citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Nations, Spirit's work seeks to expand the lens of nature from something that is often white-centered to something that's much bigger than us humans. BROOKS: I really think about nature as Mother Earth. And what I think about when I think about earth as the mother and land is really land as first teacher. And I think about nature as kind of more than human, right? And possibly, that's because of my Indigenous worldview. So I think of plants and animals as our brothers and sisters on this earth, and it's just kind of a part of who I am. HORTON: At Oregon State University, Spirit is able to share Mother Earth with students across the state. There, she works with the Outdoor School, a publicly funded statewide outdoor science program for fifth and sixth graders. This approach to land-based education centers Indigenous history and traditions. And that weeklong coursework might look different depending on if kids live in the mountains or if they live along the Pacific Coast. BROOKS: It might be curriculum related to salmon and streams, and it might focus on land-based education that centers the Indigenous peoples that live on the coast in Oregon. HORTON: There are six P's that guide Spirit's work, but we're going to just focus on three that you can even incorporate into your own nature appreciation. So there's place, which, in practice, might look like a land acknowledgement. BROOKS: I think this could be as simple as learning about the Indigenous place names in your area for streams, for mountains, for parks, and then making an effort to learn about contemporary efforts to steward local native lands in sustainable ways by tribes. HORTON: Then there's presence, which recognizes that there is still very much a vibrant Indigenous presence in our communities and across the U.S. And then there's perspective. BROOKS: We ask educators that we work with to think about some critical questions about their outdoor education curriculum. Whose perspectives are represented? Who benefits from those representations? And how are those perspectives valued or devalued? And then, I think, really importantly, what perspectives are missing? HORTON: So the next time you're at a state or national park, pick up a brochure, read the plaques or even check out apps like Native Land to get started because there's just so many perspectives missing. And it's something that outdoor professional Ash Manning didn't even realize as a young kid. ASH MANNING: I am from Appalachia, and I was born in Athens, Ga., but I was raised in the holler. HORTON: Even though Ash was always a bigger kid, they never second-guessed their love for nature. It wasn't until they went away to college when that love started to change. MANNING: I questioned being in the outdoors for a long time when, in reality, my entire childhood was in the outdoors. It was so odd. Like, you know, everyone has a right to be out there. But it's like, why did I ever think that I didn't have a right to be out there when my entire childhood was just me rolling around in some grass and making mud pies? HORTON: And the messages that they didn't belong were coming from those around them. MANNING: I started to realize that there was a lot of, like, gatekeeping on trails. There was a lot of, like, weird feeling towards plus-size people when it came to the outdoors. HORTON: Eventually, one of Ash's friends invited them to a whitewater rafting excursion in the Grand Canyon. Ash was hesitant at first, but ultimately decided to join the group, which leads us to our third takeaway - dive into the outdoors with others. MANNING: And it was pivotal because I went down the grand, and I, like, found myself just eating it up and loving every second of it and learning how I work in a boat and how to read water better and how to be a better guide and how to be a better oarsman or how to paddle better for myself and the people around me. HORTON: With her faith in Mother Nature restored, Ash wanted to find nature groups where being plus-size wasn't an anomaly. MANNING: I think being bigger - it's always been like, am I the only one doing this? The answer is no, absolutely not. There's so many of us. And I really started to kind of see that when I kind of figured out who the Unlikely Hikers were, which was started by Jenny Bruso. HORTON: Unlikely Hikers is an outdoor community featuring the underrepresented outdoors person, meaning adventurers are plus-size and fat, Black, Indigenous, people of color, queer, trans and nonbinary, disabled, neurodivergent and beyond. You can find Unlikely Hikers on Instagram, but you can also meet nature guides like Ash on hiking trails all over the U.S. And as you can probably tell, doing nature in community as a white plus-size person has given Ash a whole new confidence and freedom. MANNING: And I think that there's something refreshing for me, knowing that I can take my body into the outdoors, and it does not matter what anyone else's opinion is or was. It does not matter, like, what I've been through to even try to be out there because I can just commune with nature and just kind of be out there and just exist. HORTON: Getting out there and trying things out in a group setting can also be a lot less daunting. You can figure out what you like and don't like in the company of others. Not to mention, going out with a crew is a practical way to stay safe in more remote areas and to connect with others that have similar interests and backgrounds as you. So check out groups like Melanin Base Camp, Disabled Hikers, Outdoor Asian, Brown People Camping - just to name a few. MANNING: I think you have to ask yourself, like, does the physical side of it appeal to you? Does the meditative part of it - like, is that what draws you in? Or is it - you know, is it the adrenaline? You want cool Instagram photos? I don't know. I mean, like, there's so many questions that you can ask yourself. HORTON: So what do you want out of nature? When you stop and ask yourself that question, it's like a whole new world opens up. Given the limited access many have to big-N Nature, finding other ways to connect to the outdoors is critical and just as worthy. But you don't have to take my word for it. Here's Ming again. KUO: There's a kind of famous study in which they looked at people recovering from gallbladder operations. And it turns out that if you were in an identical room to recover but one room has a view of a brick wall and the other one has a little view of a small bit of trees, then you recover faster, in general, in the room with the green view. HORTON: This leads us to takeaway No. 4 - bring nature in - into your room, into your life, and even into the palm of your hand. As a herpetologist, Earyn McGee is constantly thinking about ways to bring her research on lizards and climate change to her followers on Twitter and Instagram, where she's best known as the creator of the #FindThatLizard game. MCGEE: #FindThatLizard is a game that I run every Wednesday. And essentially, I post a photo of a lizard camouflaged in its natural environment, and people have to find the lizard in the photo. They don't have to go outside. HORTON: And she's not just talking science, y'all. Earyn uses the game as a way to connect what's happening in lizard habitats with today's news headlines, kind of like that time she wanted to raise awareness about student protests at her alma mater, Howard University. MCGEE: I talked about how lizards were being impacted by habitat loss. And then I said something along the lines of, in addition to making sure that we have proper habitat for these lizards, we also need to make sure that we're having proper housing for students. HORTON: As everyone so far has gotten at, we are a part of nature and it's a part of us. And we can have fun with what that relationship looks like with other online games like Crow or No and Just the Skull. There's even things like live wildlife webcams and virtual aquarium tours. And don't worry, we'll link to some good ones on our episode page. But these are just some ways that we can bring the outdoors to us. And it's especially useful for those who might be disabled, immunocompromised and/or unable to spend money on fancy gear and travel. MCGEE: I'm also super into houseplants, and that's a way of bringing nature into your house. So either you can have, like, houseplants or you can start, like, a small garden or something. And that's a really great way to start thinking about ecosystems and the environment. HORTON: Other ways to immerse yourself in the outdoors can include, but are absolutely not limited to, barbecuing in the backyard, opening the windows to get fresh air, using an essential oil diffuser or even taking a walk in the neighborhood, something me and my puppy Tex love to do. But no matter how you decide to engage with nature, it's important that the generations after us can do so as well. And, no, you don't need to solve climate change on your own by next year. But that leads us to our fifth and final takeaway, which is to appreciate the outdoors for our todays and our tomorrows. BROOKS: The world is kind of a [expletive] show right now. It's a mess. And with climate change and the impact of pollution and greed on communities of color specifically, I feel like it's more important than ever for all of us to have a connection to nature and the outside. HORTON: This is it, y'all. This is our home that we share with other animals and our plant siblings, and we should start getting to know each other really well. If nothing else, it's a reminder to get to know ourselves and get back to our inner child, who's very eager to make some more mud pies. So I hope this has been helpful and a whole lot of fun because finding your footing in the great outdoors is a wonderful experience that we all need and deserve. So whether you've climbed to new peaks in the Rockies or you've started sharing photos of your favorite flowers in the group chat, all of it counts. So before we go, let's recap. Takeaway 1 - nature is the ultimate multivitamin, so go out there and go get you some. Takeaway No. 2 - recognize and celebrate the Indigenous history of the land we are on. It will truly ground your experiences in the outdoors. Takeaway No. 3 - explore the outdoors with others. Take a friend. Find new friends. But just don't feel like you've got to go about it alone. Takeaway No. 4 - bring the outdoors into your world, whether it's caring for houseplants or playing that #FindThatLizard game. And our final takeaway, No. 5 - create a legacy that inspires others around you to appreciate the outdoors, too.

wins album of the year at 2025 Latin Grammys \n         By Isabella Gomez Sarmiento \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 2:11 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         On Thursday night, Puerto Rican superstar  Bad Bunny  took home the biggest prize at the Latin Grammy awards: His genre-bending homage to his island,  DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS , won album of the year. Despite the fact that he had a dozen trophies in his case before the night even began, he had never won any in the show's three major categories — album, record or song of the year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio appeared perplexed as he walked onstage during the Las Vegas ceremony, initially heading in the wrong direction before he corrected course and approached the microphone to accept the night's final golden gramophone. The 31-year-old thanked his family and collaborators, and dedicated the award to all the young people of Latin America and Puerto Rico in particular. \"Hay muchas maneras de hacer patria y defender nuestra tierra — nosotros escogemos la música,\" he said. (\"There are many ways to show patriotism and defend our land — we choose music.\") Bad Bunny won four additional Latin Grammys in the urban and reggaeton categories. The Latin Grammy victories have the potential to kick off a season of wins for the rapper. He is also  nominated  for six awards at the Grammys, (including album of the year, song of the year and record of the year) and will  headline  the halftime show during the Super Bowl in February. When it came to the other major categories at the 26th annual Latin Grammys — song of the year and record of the year — the Latin Recording Academy awarded familiar faces. Colombian pop-reggaetonera  Karol G  received song of the year for her Dominican-infused merengue hit, \"Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido,\" alongside her fellow songwriters Edgar Barrera and Andres Jael Correa Rios. Record of the year went to Spanish artist and composer  Alejandro Sanz  for his slow pop ballad, \"Palmeras En El Jardín.\" \"Benito, I stole it from you. Forgive me,\" Sanz joked in Spanish as he accepted the award, referring to Bad Bunny by his first name. Cameras panned to Bad Bunny, who laughed and clapped. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Latin Grammys spanned 60 categories in all, which included a wide range of genres as well as behind-the-scenes awards for production, arranging and visual media. The majority of those awards were given out earlier in the evening, before the main ceremony began in Las Vegas. Another big winner of the night was the Argentine duo  CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso , who took home five awards across the pop, alternative and music video categories for their exuberant yet satirical album  Papota . (Around half of the album was recorded during their performance at NPR's Tiny Desk last year, and one NPR engineer is listed among the nominees for his contributions to the album.) The childhood best friends delivered one of the most energetic performances of the ceremony, a medley of their songs that featured prop sewing machines and bodybuilders as on-stage extras and culminated in CA7RIEL and Paco perched on top of office chairs. The award for best new artist went to Mexican alt-pop singer  Paloma Morphy . Legacy artists like  Gloria Estefan ,  Fito Páez  and  Rubén Blades  also received awards in the traditional tropical, rock and salsa categories, respectively. Brazilian soul singer  Liniker  — who made history in 2022 as the first trans woman to ever win a Latin Grammy — was nominated for six awards, including album of the year, song of the year and record of the year. She won for best Portuguese language album, best Portuguese language urban performance and best Portuguese language song for her project  Caju . But Liniker stole the show during a performance near the end of the ceremony, dancing her way through the funky \"Negona Dos Olhos Terriveis\" and getting celebrities like Karol G, Gloria Estefan and Elena Rose moving along with her. Winners and presenters largely avoided addressing heightened political tensions and anxieties faced by Latino communities in the United States, focusing instead on celebrating pan-Latin music and artistry. Legendary corrido band  Los Tigres del Norte  was an exception. During their performance of the socially conscious \"La Lotería,\" the group played with instruments decked out in Latin American flags. Behind them, they projected images of immigrants rights protests across the country. When power duo Gloria and Emilio Estefan accepted the Grammy for best traditional tropical album for  Raíces , they ended their speech with a nod to the Latin diaspora. \"Se lo dedico a todos los Latinos que seguimos triunfando en todas partes del mundo,\" Emilio Estefan said. \"Viva la musica Latina.\" (\"I dedicate this to all of us Latinos who keep succeeding all over the world. Long live Latin music.\") \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582812","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:12:00-05:00","title":"This oil-producing country is moving away from oil.

from oil. Here's how it's going \n         By Julia Simon \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 1:12 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea. A few years ago , oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there. It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last. Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2023, Petro pledged to  stop approving new exploration contracts  for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step. Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going? When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil. But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says  Ana Carolina González Espinosa ,  senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says. \"I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,\" she says. \"But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.\" \"It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,\" she says. Why Colombia is doing this Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy. Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector. But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to  a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes . The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050. Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says  Guy Edwards , who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop. \" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,\" González Espinosa says, \"then we are going to be in trouble.\" Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol. The year before Petro took office, the company  acquired an electricity transmission company . In recent years, they've acquired more  solar  and  wind projects . And they're investing in  geothermal energy , drilling deep into the earth to create electricity. \"The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,\" Lemos says, \"but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.\" \"We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.\" Renewable progress and failures A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro. Solar made up around  9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024 , according to data from XM,  Colombia's electricity market operator . That's up from  roughly 1.5% in 2022 . Petro's government has introduced something called \"energy communities,\" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract  international financing  for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently  streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar  making it more efficient, says  Manuel Schulte , chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy. But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says. Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors  have given up on renewable projects ,  particularly wind projects . The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has  acquired some of these abandoned wind projects . Losing the messaging fight Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the \"myth,\" she says, that the country's energy transition \"will be an economic hindrance.\" \" The opposite,\" Muhamad says. \"What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.\" Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press.  His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines  have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as \"disastrous for the Colombian economy.\" Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels. \" They didn't resonate with the national audience,\" González Espinosa says in an email. \"It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.\" Looking to the future  Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote. As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal,  Estefanny Pardo , mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it. \"The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,\" Pardo says in Spanish. An upcoming conference Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023. Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production. Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels. If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through. \"Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   This week, world leaders are in Brazil for the annual U.N. climate conference to talk about how to cut planet-heating emissions. Scientists say a key way is for some fossil fuel-producing countries to stop exploring for new fossil fuels. One country's government decided to do just that - Colombia. NPR's Julia Simon went there to learn more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In a fishing village on Colombia's Caribbean coast, music plays in cafes lining the beach. It is cooler by the sea, where the wind blows through the trees. Out past the fishing boats, out in the turquoise sea, oil companies found deep water natural gas and planned to drill gas wells there. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, wants those wells to be among the country's last. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers, and President Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on climate change. Two years ago, at the U.N. climate conference, Petro took the stage and said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT GUSTAVO PETRO: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: \"Colombia,\" he says, \"has stopped signing exploration contracts for coal, oil and gas.\" This was a big deal. Stopping new exploration for fossil fuels is a key way to transition away from fossil fuels. Now the question is, how is Colombia's energy transition playing out? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: OK. To find out, I went to a leafy neighborhood in central Bogota, in the high-rise office of Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol. There I met... JULIAN LEMOS: Julian Lemos. SIMON: ...Corporate vice president of strategy and new business. Lemos says the oil company is diversifying. Ecopetrol has acquired an electricity transmission company, more solar and wind projects, and they're investing in geothermal, drilling deep into the Earth to create electricity. LEMOS: The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company, but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power transmission. SIMON: Energy experts say this isn't just a good move for the climate. It's a good move for Colombia's economy. Colombia has manufacturing, tourism and agriculture, but the government is still very reliant on the oil and coal sectors for revenues. Ana Carolina Gonzalez Espinosa, at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute, says as Colombia's oil reserves shrink and demand for oil and coal eventually fall, that will be a problem. ANA CAROLINA GONZALEZ ESPINOSA: If we don't think about how we'll diversify the economy, then we are going to be in trouble. SIMON: Key to diversifying the energy sector is solar and wind. Solar, in particular, is growing - both large-scale and small-scale projects for communities lacking electricity. But the sector has problems too. In some parts of Colombia, the grid still isn't big enough to handle all the new solar and wind. Many projects are on land belonging to Indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve them in planning, says Margarita Nieves, a renewable energy researcher. She says some renewable developers have left. MARGARITA NIEVES: Each project has its own challenges. SIMON: Petro's term ends in 2026, and that raises another question. Will his energy policies outlast him? Petro's government hasn't awarded new licenses to explore for fossil fuels, but this isn't signed into law.

How to make the most of your cash \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Updated Thursday, April 14, 2022 • 6:54 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It doesn't take an expert to know that money is so much more than dollars and cents. Our relationship with money is  emotional.  Hopes and fears, guilt and shame — they can all play a significant role in your financial life.  And those feelings can be tied to lots of things: our upbringing, our environment, plus, y' know, all the money messaging in the world and the media. But honing those feelings and creating your own strong, secure financial voice? That takes some expertise.  Tiffany Aliche, better known as The Budgetnista, is a financial expert, educator, and author of the new book  Get Good With Money   (out March 30) .  Her book is a super practical guide to getting your financial house in order to achieve what Aliche calls financial wholeness. It's based around ten pillars: budgeting, savings, debt, credit, learning to earn, investing, insurance, net worth, getting your financial team in place and estate planning. Her book dives deep into each of these topics, but Aliche says this process begins with understanding your own financial identity and the many feelings and environmental forces that shape it.  \" For me, money is more mindset than dollars and coins, \"  she says. We can all, says Aliche, get good with money — we just have to get good with our feelings, first. Read on for tips for accessing your emotions around money, and learning to strengthen your financial voice. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.  Andee Tagle: You talk about how you used to live in the state of financial fear, and you say that financial wholeness is the cure to that financial fear, or to financial trauma. I love that idea. How do you define that term?  Tiffany Aliche:  I define financial wholeness as when all aspects of your financial life, and there's ten that we lean into truly — when all of these aspects of your financial life are working congruently for what I like to call your greatest good, your biggest benefit and your richest life. I would say financial freedom is for the few, but financial wholeness is for everyone. It doesn't matter how much you make. It doesn't matter what you do for a living. It doesn't matter how old you are. Financial wholeness can be achieved by everyone. And so it's just a holistic view of what to do with my money and how to maximize and make the most of it.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How Filing Taxes Will Be Different Because Of The Coronavirus \n       I want to talk a little bit about the emotions behind money. I loved what you had to say about being aware of the influences in our life that might affect our habits and our financial voice. I know in my own life, for example, I immediately thought about how my dad was always super, super frugal. You know, he asked for discounts wherever we went. That's a really valuable skill, but as a kid, I just remember feeling so embarrassed. And so now as an adult, I just have zero haggling ability and, you know, probably I'm worse off for it. How do we break those habits? So one of the things I illustrate in the book is one, acknowledging that you see that habit. So that's first. You can't break something that you don't acknowledge and see: what is the habit that I'm seeing in myself? Then, two, exploring where it came from. And so, bravo to you again, Andee for recognizing, 'OK, this is from Dad,' you know. And then three, practicing in a safe environment.  So what I would tell you, is don't worry about the financial haggling for now. You know, if you are not haggling financially, you might be someone that's uncomfortable with asking the waiter for extra cheese— Oh, one hundred percent. I can never send a sandwich back. Okay so that's a baby step. So it's like, sending something back or maybe just asking for something additional like, 'Oh can I also get that,' because what you want to do is you want to practice advocating for yourself. Because it's hard to jump into the financial application if you're not able to advocate for yourself in small, little ways.  That's great advice. I want to talk a little bit about mindful spending. Can you break down the different priorities people should be thinking about for us?  Absolutely. It's: Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? We already know needs: food, shelter, clothing, water. Things you must have to maintain your health and safety. Second, are your loves.  Loves will continue to give you joy six months to a year from now. Likes give you temporary joy, in under six months you might not remember. And wants are fleeting.  So what I want people to do is to lean into the first half of the equation, your needs and your loves. So you need to take care of your health and safety and loves that give you lasting joy, and less money toward likes and wants — not  no  money, but the more money you spend on likes and wants, the less money you have for needs and loves.  You tell this great story in the book and it's about saying no to brunch with your girlfriends for a very specific reason. Can you share that story with us?  Yes, so friends of mine would go to brunch every Sunday and it was maybe, say, 30 to 50 bucks every time. And one day I realized I wanted to go on vacation, but I didn't have any money.  And then when [my friend called] and was like, 'Hey, girl, you want to go to brunch?' I thought to myself, that's where my money is going! And I realized brunch is not a love for me because I don't even remember what we ate last week. I was spending my money on  her  loves.  Now, it's not her fault because she was doing what she was supposed to do, spend her money on her love. But she was convincing me to do so as well. So I stopped going and I almost made it like a drinking game. Every time somebody said \"brunch,\" I put that money in my savings account.  And then when I had enough,  I used it to go on my first solo trip. I wanted to go to Albuquerque because it's the hot air balloon capital of the world and I've never ridden a hot air balloon. And so now I learned that I'm not saying no to brunch, I'm saying yes to Morocco. I'm not saying no to brunch, I'm saying yes to India. I'm saying yes to Monaco. And so I always encourage people to do the same. I want you to use your money to live an actual richer, more joyful life. I want you to make sure you're not using your money towards someone else's idea of love.  So, Tiffany, you came from a household where you were talking about money all the time. But what about people where that where that wasn't the case? How can we get comfortable talking about money?   You're right. I think the average person did not have these conversations at home. So how do you naturally do that? You have to find a safe environment to do so. It might just be a group of your girlfriends where you've said, like, 'I would love you to be my accountability partner and I'm just going to talk about money with you.' And if you don't know anybody in your own physical real life, there are digital folks that you can lean into and virtual people that you can lean into.  I speak freely in front of my friends about money on purpose because I'm always trying to create a safe environment: 'I'm not going to judge; I don't know what's right or wrong for you, I'm just here to present you with as much knowledge as possible so you could choose the right choice for yourself.'  So make sure that when you're looking for these safe spaces, that that's the energy you get.  This piece originally published on March 28, 2021.

I'm Andee Tagle, one of the producers of the show, and today, we're going to talk about money. More specifically, we're going to talk feelings about money - hopes and fears, guilt and shame and the significant role they play in your financial life. Feeling uncomfortable yet? Good. Then we're in the same boat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: I've never been great with money, a trait I often blamed on being too busy or perpetually poor math skills or a weakness for convenience and good sample sales. But of course, my dilemma is more complex than just a bad relationship with algebra. TIFFANY ALICHE: Money is more mindset than coins, than dollars and coins. TAGLE: That's Tiffany Aliche. ALICHE: Much better known as the Budgetnista, I like to say I'm America's favorite financial educator - if not, at least your favorite financial educator. TAGLE: In addition to being one of LIFE KIT's favorite financial educators, Aliche is the author of the new book \"Get Good With Money.\" It's a super practical guide to getting your financial house in order to achieve what she calls financial wholeness in 10 steps. ALICHE: Budgeting, savings, debt, credit, learning to earn, investing, insurance, net worth, getting your financial team in place and estate planning. The first five are super, super, super foundational, and then the next five builds upon those first five. TAGLE: Her book dives deep into each one of these topics, but Aliche says this process begins with understanding your own financial identity and the many feelings and environmental forces that shape it. For Aliche, conversations about money have been front and center her whole life. ALICHE: Like, kids had Sweet 16s, but at 16, we walked to the bank down the street to open up our first joint bank account with my parents. And so I just grew up not having kind of, like, hang-ups about money because it was normal conversation. I was like, you guys don't have money talk Thursday nights? TAGLE: Not all of us might have been so lucky, but we can all, says Aliche, get good with money. We just have to get good with our feelings first. In this episode of LIFE KIT, tips for accessing your emotions around money and learning to strengthen your financial voice. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: You talk about how you used to live in this state of financial fear, and you say that financial wholeness is the cure to that financial fear or to financial trauma. And I love that idea - financial wholeness. How do you define it? How do you define that term? Let's start there. ALICHE: So I define financial wholeness when all aspects of your financial life - and there's 10 that we lean into truly - so when all of these 10 aspects of your financial life are working congruently for what I like to call your greatest good, your biggest benefit and your richest life. TAGLE: Greatest good, biggest benefit, richest life. That's really smart. ALICHE: Yes. I would say financial freedom is for the few, but financial wholeness is for everyone. It doesn't matter how much you make. It doesn't matter what you do for a living. It doesn't matter how old you are. Financial wholeness can be achieved by everyone, and so it's just a holistic view of, like, what to do with my money and how to maximize and make the most of it. TAGLE: So financial wholeness is really about making sure you have a strong foundation for wherever you're at. ALICHE: Wherever you're at. TAGLE: Wherever you're at. It's not about being a millionaire. It's about just making sure, wherever you're at, you have an appropriate foundation. You have the appropriate, you know, pillars in place. ALICHE: Exactly, because from there, then you can build. What's so great about financial wholeness is that it is, like, the prerequisite to the rest of your financial life. If you get that solid foundation - like, I grew up with a solid foundation, so as a result, even though, like, I lost my first condo to foreclosure and I lost my job and I had this scam happen, I'm here and stronger than ever before because of that financial foundation. And now I pass that gift on to y'all through \"Get Good With Money.\" TAGLE: I want to talk a little bit about the emotions behind money. I loved what you had to say about money-messaging and being aware of the influences in our life that might affect our habits and our financial voice. I know in my own life, for example, I immediately thought about how my dad was always super, super frugal. You know, he asked for discounts wherever we went. That's a really valuable skill, but as a kid, I just remember feeling so embarrassed. Like, I just remember turning beet red. And so now as an adult, I just have zero haggling ability - just none at all - and, you know, probably, I'm worse off for it, you know? So how do we break those habits? ALICHE: So one of the things I illustrate in the book is that 1, bravo to you, Andee, for acknowledging that you see that habit. So that's first. You can't break something that you don't acknowledge and see. So teaching folks to see, 1, what is the habit that I'm seeing in myself, you know? Then 2, exploring where it came from. And so, like, bravo to you again, recognizing, like, oh, this is from dad, you know? And then 3, practicing in a safe environment. So what I would tell you, Andee, is that, like, OK, don't worry about, like, the financial haggling for now. You know, likely, if you are not haggling financially, you might be someone that's uncomfortable with, like, sharing with the waiter, actually, can I get extra cheese on my macaroni and cheese, right? TAGLE: A thousand percent. ALICHE: Right? So that's me, too, right? TAGLE: (Laughter). ALICHE: And so I would say, OK, it's a baby step. TAGLE: I can never send a sandwich back. ALICHE: Yeah. So it's like, sending something back - and not even sending something back - maybe just asking for something additional, like, oh, can I also get dot, dot, dot because what you're wanting to do is you want to practice advocating for yourself, you know, because it's hard to jump into the financial advocation, you know, for yourself if you're not able to advocate in small, little ways - so starting with a safe, simple practice and then leading your way up from there. TAGLE: And breaking these habits, you talk about, is in service of doing something you mention in the book, which is finding your financial voice. What is your financial voice, and how does someone go about finding their own? ALICHE: So your financial voice is - everyone has this internal voice as they're doing something. So if you're wanting to find your financial voice, I just want you today to - every time you make a financial choice, I want you to, like, do kind of like a heart check, you know, and ask yourself, what am I thinking? What am I feeling? I want you to practice pausing. Like, let's get Uber Eats. Pause for a moment and ask yourself, how am I thinking? How am I feeling about this? You know, am I thinking or feeling nothing, you know, which is fine? Or am I feeling a little anxious or a little guilty 'cause this is another Amazon purchase? Whatever that is, I want you to stop, pause, check and kind of mentally record for yourself. And then I want you to kind of get a pulse of, do you largely think about your financial choices positively or negatively? So this might actually - like, if you really find that you're having a hard time mentally with money, this, you might - a little notebook might really help because literally you might, you know - like, you might have a happy face on one side of the notebook and a sad face and literally just a checkmark. Like, oh, that was a positive thought - check. That was a negative thought - check. Because we're trying to get a gauge of, like, how are you with your finances, and what is your money message to yourself, and what is your voice? Is it a positive voice? Is it a neutral voice? Or is it a negative voice? And it's already there. You just want to tune in to listen to it, but you also want to actively work toward changing and transforming it to something more positive. TAGLE: That's great advice. Now, we've asked about this before, but I want to talk a little bit about mindful spending. Can you break down the different priorities people should be thinking about for us? ALICHE: Absolutely. It's do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? And so needs are - we already know - food, shelter, clothing, water. You must have to maintain your health and safety. Second are your loves. Loves give you joy - will continue to give you joy six months to a year from now. Likes give you temporary joy, so in under six months, you won't remember, right? So it's like, OK, you know, this thing is cool. So likes give you, like, that temporary joy. And wants, there's really no joy at all. So what I want people to do is to lean into, like, the first half of the equation - your needs and your loves. So your needs take care of your health and safety, and loves give you lasting joy - and less money toward likes and wants. Not no money, but the more money you spend on likes and wants, the less money you have for needs and loves. TAGLE: Great. I want to change gears a little bit. We had a listener question come in, and as soon as it came in, I thought of you. And you kind of address this in your book. I'm just going to read it for you. How do you budget your spending for the month when you're starting at zero dollars available? On the first of every month, I balance my checkbook by putting in my pay and entering all of my usual monthly bills, but by the time I subtract my monthly bills, I literally have zero dollars left for the month. I even have to transfer money from my savings into my checking account just to cover the bills, which leaves me with negative money. I don't ever buy coffee or eat out. How do you manage your income when you simply don't cover your expenses? And I know this is something that a lot of people are dealing with, you know, with the pandemic, with, you know, having all of these surprise emergency, you know, spendings. What do we do? What do people do in this situation? ALICHE: If most of your money, like this listener, is going to your financial obligations - like, maybe all of your money or actually more money than you actually have - then that means you have a don't make enough issue. I think if nothing else, this pandemic and quarantine has taught us that we all have to learn how to earn in multiple ways because some people's whole industry knocked out - the restaurant industry, movie industry. So learning to earn, but in the meantime - and this is what I had to learn. It was a hard thing, and it might be hard for you, listener, to hear - is that I had to drop down to what I call my health and safety budget. That is, what things on my list must I pay for to maintain my health and to maintain my safety? Everybody else had to wait. So I'm giving you permission to say, you know what, I need to prioritize myself before I prioritize my bills because if I'm not here, if I'm not healthy, if I'm not safe, who's going to pay them anyway? Nobody. TAGLE: I'm moving on a little bit to savings. You say we should save like a squirrel. ALICHE: Yes (laughter). TAGLE: And I really like that. How do we get squirrelly? Just, you know, big picture - how can we all get a little more squirrelly? ALICHE: This is what squirrels do. Work the hardest - they save the most. And when wintertime comes, squirrels - like, they hole up in their little tree, and they eat off of the - when they work the hardest, and they save the most. And so that's what we can be. Like, human beings are the opposite. When we get our raises, when we get our bonuses, it's like, drinks on me, drinks on me, you know? We tend to spend the most and be like, well, things are good. I don't need to work hard, you know? And then when financial winter comes, we're like - that's when we try to put the more work in, you know, but there's no work to be found. So that's how you get squirrely then. If you're experiencing financial abundance, lean into it. Like, you know, work a little bit harder if you're capable, but definitely save a little more because some of that - your financial acorns - are actually meant for your financial winter as well. TAGLE: I love that. You tell this great story in the book, and it's about saying no to brunch with your girlfriends for a very specific reason. Can you share that story with us? ALICHE: Yes. So friends of mine would go to brunch every Sunday. It was maybe like, say, 30 to 50 bucks every time. And one day, I realized I wanted to go on vacation, but I didn't have any money. And then when I was realizing it, she called and was like, hey, girl, you want to go to brunch? And I thought to myself, that's where my money is going. Like, did I - what did we even eat last week? And I realized brunch is not a love for me because I don't even remember what we had last week. She loved brunch. That was her love. I was spending my money on her loves. Now, it's not her fault because she was doing what she's supposed to do - spend her money on her love - but she was convincing me to do it as well. So I stopped going to brunch, and I almost made it, like, how you do, like, a drinking game. Every time somebody says Andee, you take a drink. But I said every time someone says brunch, I put that money in my savings account. That was my drinking game. And so every time they invite me to brunch, I would transfer 30 to 50 bucks to a savings account, and then when I had enough, I used it to go to my first solo trip. And so now I learned that I'm not saying no to brunch. I'm saying yes to Morocco. I'm not saying no to brunch. I'm saying yes to India. And these are real countries I've been to. I'm saying yes to Monaco. I'm saying yes to Italy. And so I always encourage people to do the same. I want you to use your money to live an actual richer, more joyful life. I want you to make sure you're not using your money towards someone else's idea of loves. To me, that's not the best use of your money. TAGLE: What especially spoke to me was that you said you learned how to say no in a different way. It wasn't just no, sorry, I'm busy. You didn't make excuses, you know? You changed your language. Can you give us some template language for how we might be able to change our language? You know, when those uncomfortable situations come, how can we say no to brunch too? ALICHE: So whatever it is that you're saving toward - 'cause I don't believe saving's just for saving's sake. You can save toward emergencies or save toward goals because saving towards saving's sake means that you probably are not enjoying as much life as you ought to, right? So if your emergency savings is fully funded - you got your six months, your year, your three months, whatever you think is necessary - great. You can say, you know, I would love to - you know, it sounds really awesome to go to dot, dot, dot or to go to the mall or whatever, but honestly, I'm saving toward sharing that amazing, dope thing because your friends and your family - they love you. And so that's really the language - identifying the thing that you're saving toward, your goal or emergency savings or otherwise, and then reiterating that language to the person that's asking you to spend, because I promise you, that positive language feels good to you and to them. You're not actually saying no to them 'cause what they hear is, oh, wow, Tiffany - Andee is saying yes to herself. She is saying yes to this awesome goal, not no to me. TAGLE: So Tiffany, you came from a household where you were talking about money all the time, but what about people where that wasn't the case? You know, how can we get comfortable talking about money? What can we say? What can we do? How can we start having those conversations? ALICHE: You're right. I think the average person did not have these conversations at home. So how do you naturally do that? So you have to find a safe environment to do so. It might just be a group of your girlfriends where you've said, like, you know, this is my - you know, I would love you to be my accountability partner, and I'm just going to talk about money with you. So finding a safe environment to do so, and if you don't know anybody in your own physical real life, that there are digital folks that you could lean into and virtual people that you can lean into. I speak freely in front of my friends about money on purpose because I'm always trying to create a safe environment. I'm not going to judge. For me, I don't know what's right or wrong for you. The educator in me is just merely here to present you with as much knowledge as possible so you could choose the right choice for yourself. So make sure that when you're looking for these safe spaces, that that's the energy you get. TAGLE: So I'm hearing seek out a safe space. It doesn't necessarily have to be your family or your household. And also, you know, destigmatize it. Like, don't be scared to talk about it, normalize it. It's OK to talk about dollar amounts. It's OK to talk about salaries. Familiarize yourself first as you need. Dip your toe in first. ALICHE: Yeah, dip that little pinky toe in. (LAUGHTER) TAGLE: Tiffany Aliche, the Budgetnista, thank you so much for joining us. This has been wonderful. ALICHE: This has been awesome, Andee. It's always a good time with you. Thank you for having me back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, let's recap what we've learned. Money is so much more than dollars and cents. Our relationship with money is emotional, and those feelings are tied to lots of things - your upbringing, your environment, plus, you know, all the money-messaging in the world and the media. Learn to hone your financial voice by first being aware of the money influences in your own life, then take time to examine your financial decision-making. Do you feel mostly good or mostly guilty about your choices? Track your feelings if you're not totally sure where you're at. If you want to change a habit, start small and practice in a safe environment. Maybe enlist a friend to be your accountability partner. Next, be more mindful of your spending by differentiating between your purchases. ALICHE: Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? TAGLE: Remember, a no to a like can and should be reframed as a yes to a love. Your friends and family will understand, and they might just be inspired to do the same. Finally, you can work towards financial wholeness by just talking about it more. Seek out safe spaces with your people or online, and ask the questions you want to ask. Air out your grievances. The more money conversations are out there, the less they're stigmatized, the more empowered we all are. It's just good sense.

apologizes for edit of Trump speech but says it won't provide legal compensation \n         By Willem Marx \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 6:41 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, has issued a personal apology to former U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his Jan. 6, 2021 speech in a documentary broadcast under its often investigative series, called \"Panorama.\" But the BBC has firmly rejected demand from Trump's legal team for compensation. His personal attorneys had threatened a $1 billion defamation lawsuit unless it retracts the program, apologizes, and pays for \"financial and reputational harm.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a letter to the White House released late Thursday, BBC Chair Samir Shah said he and the corporation were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech \" acknowledging that the way the footage was spliced created \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" But despite the apology, the statement made clear it does not concede the defamation claim. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the corporation said.The documentary — titled  Trump: A Second Chance?  — was commissioned by the BBC from an external production company and aired shortly before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together separate parts of Trump's speech on the day of the Capitol riots, even though the excerpts came from moments almost an hour apart. Critics argued that the edit misrepresented the president's words, especially by omitting a section where he had called for peaceful protest.  Swift, public consequences In its retraction, the BBC accepted that the editing \"unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech … and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" The broadcaster also announced it had no plans to rebroadcast the episode. The legal threat from an incumbent U.S. president has triggered serious fallout at the BBC. Director-General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness both resigned in the wake of the controversy. In a message to staff, Davie admitted \"we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach,\" but also urged them to defend the BBC's journalism under growing pressure. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The British government has also been drawn into the debate. Lisa Nandy, a Labour MP and culture minister, defended the broadcaster in Parliament this week, highlighting its importance at a time of political polarization and widespread misinformation.  \"It is by far the most widely used and trusted source of news in the United Kingdom,\" she told fellow lawmakers.  \"At a time when the lines are being dangerously blurred between fact and opinion, news and polemic, the BBC stands apart.\" A legally complex case The president's lawyers have threatened to file suit in Florida, but legal experts note that it could be difficult for Trump to argue reputational damage in the U.S. since the documentary did not air there widely, so it may be challenging to prove Americans watched and were influenced by the film. Still, the dispute has stirred a broader debate about the BBC's role and accountability.  Critics fear that, if forced to pay out, the BBC could be using public funds to settle with a foreign head of state.  For many in the UK, this touches on national pride and the public broadcaster's mission to inform and educate, not to be dragged into costly legal battles. If the case proceeds, it could cost millions in legal fees, even if the BBC ultimately wins, and media lawyers say the public nature of pre-trial disclosures could have a huge cost to the broadcaster's reputation. Opposition from the British public Established over a century ago and operating under a Royal Charter, the BBC is funded almost entirely through a TV license fee that is paid by most UK households.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Its reporting has shaped the national understanding and perception of wars, elections, royal events and major cultural moments, meaning the lawsuit has touched a cultural nerve for many Britons.  That was sharply articulated during a BBC radio phone-in shortly earlier this week.  One caller, identifying himself only as Simon from the southwest town of Truro, warned he would not support public funds reimbursing the former U.S. president.  \"If we have to pay a penny to Trump, then I'm sorry — I'm not going to pay my TV license,\" he said. \"The world just seems to be frightened of him. I think the BBC needs to stand up to him.\" Media analysts say this reaction reflects how entwined the BBC is with British national identity. \"The idea that an American president would sue the British broadcaster, paid for by British taxpayers— sue for a billion dollars for a 12-second edit of a speech he made is pretty astonishing,\" says Jane Martinson, a columnist for the Guardian newspaper and journalism professor at London's City University. Martinson also says Trump's latest threat repeated a pattern of trying to exploit existing dissatisfaction— in this case that stems from the BBC's coverage of other issues, like Gaza, gender rights and British politics.  \"It's about sowing dissent on the very nature of accuracy and impartiality.\" A broadcasting giant Stewart Purvis, former editor at ITN and once a senior communications regulator, said the corporation plays a role unmatched elsewhere.  \"The BBC is the most consumed broadcast media outlet in the UK. It's almost like combining two or even three of the American networks,\" Purvis told NPR.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"You know, everybody loves the BBC in some way, but everyone has something to complain about, about the BBC.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607268","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"As social media grows more toxic, college athletes ask themselves: Is it worth it?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As social media grows more toxic, college athletes are increasingly questioning whether the financial benefits from social media and sponsored content are worth the emotional toll.

5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In real life, it's hard to imagine that a stranger would decide to harass  Cam Corhen . Corhen is 21 years old and 6 feet, 10 inches tall. He's got 235 pounds of muscle draped across his broad frame. And he's a Division I college athlete: a forward for the Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team, averaging 15 points per game. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the internet, though, none of that stops people. The harassment of athletes on social media has  become an epidemic , an experience so common that players today accept it as a fact of life. College basketball players are more at risk than athletes in other sports, the NCAA has found, especially  around March Madness , when thousands of abusive or threatening messages flood athletes, many of them from gamblers — some of it so severe and alarmingly specific that the NCAA must alert law enforcement. The toll it takes, players say, has become difficult to bear. Fighting through tears after his Wildcats lost last March to end a disappointing season, Kansas State's Coleman Hawkins said the online criticism had gotten to him. \"I did a poor job of letting people talk about me and affect my play,\" he said, sobbing. \"I wish I could just go back and block out everything.\" When the name, image and likeness door was thrown open for college athletes, social media promised to be a cash cow. Build a personal brand with a following on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, and  lucrative sponsorship deals  would soon come rolling in. But as harassment and threats have grown, players (and coaches, too) have begun to ask themselves: Are the business opportunities worth the harassment? Increasingly, they have decided the answer is no. \"At the end of the day, we are human beings. We have feelings,\" said Indiana's Oumar Ballo after the Hoosiers lost in last year's Big Ten tournament, which sealed their fate of being left out of March Madness. Imagine, he said, \"you wake up, go to work, and someone is wishing nothing but the worst to you and your work. It's mentally draining.\" \"If you're not cheering for us, then leave us alone,\" he added. Online abuse is getting far worse Corhen's eyes opened to the problem during his sophomore year, when he still played for Florida State University. In a November 2023 game against Colorado, he hurt his toe and had to leave the game early. The Seminoles won in overtime, but Corhen scored only two points. Afterward, he got on the team bus and looked at his phone for the first time in hours. On his home screen were a series of unsettling DMs. \"I messed somebody's parlay up, I guess, and I got some crazy messages,\" Corhen said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       One said, \"I hope your mom dies,\" he recalled. At the time, Corhen was just 19 years old, barely a year removed from leaving home. It rattled him. He struggled to shake it off. Nearly everybody in big-time college sports has this story now. To be launched from the anonymity of high school into the brightly-lit world of Division I college sports — with a media landscape that stretches from TV to news sites to podcasts to social media — is a wild ride. Having a social media presence is effectively compulsory. \"As an athlete, you want to be out there. You want people to know your name,\" said SMU guard Kyla Deck. \"It can maximize the money you're making. It can maximize the stage you're putting yourself on.\" To help their athletes build those brands, big-time athletic departments now employ staff dedicated to an assembly line of \"creative content\" for players to post — highlight packages, interviews, game footage shot by in-house camera crews perched on the sidelines specifically for social media highlight reels. Players often supplement those posts with stylist-approved fashion shots. All this, of course, is to make money. Starting in 2021, when a U.S. Supreme Court decision forced the NCAA's hand in allowing student-athletes to earn income from licensing their name, image and likeness, or NIL, college athletes have regularly netted tens of thousands of dollars (or more) from sponsored social media posts and other marketing partnerships. Even athletes with modest numbers of followers can earn money this way: Baylor's Bella Fontleroy (6,000 Instagram followers)  recently hawked TLF Apparel sweatsuits . UCLA's Gianna Kneepkens (4,500 followers) has ads for  Celsius energy drinks  and  the Japanese snack company Baby Star  on her feed. The St. John's forward Zuby Ejiofor (7,600 followers)  posted for Bose . Houston's Emanuel Sharp (12,000 followers)  did a post for the fast food chain Freddy's . Like the rest, Corhen began his career that way. But open Corhen's Instagram now, though, and you'll see nothing. No posts at all. Back in 2023, Corhen returned from his toe injury after a month, but struggled to live up to his potential that season, averaging just 9.4 points per game. Looking for a fresh start, he transferred to Pitt. Still, he struggled with his mental health, he said, and the criticism online made it worse. The public tweets are hostile enough. (A typical example: In January, after Corhen managed just two points in an 82-70 loss against Florida State, one X user wrote \"f*** you point shaving bum @cameroncorhen.\") \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"After a game, it would pop up on the front page of my phone, what people arej saying if they tagged me,\" he said. \"And it's just, like — I don't need that.\" The DMs, of course, were worse. \"Mind you, these are people with burner accounts, so you don't know who they are. You don't know their identity,\" he said. \"And you lost their money, so they say really hurtful things.\" This summer, almost two seasons after the gambler wished death on his mom, the Pitt forward decided to delete it all. \"I couldn't get over that hump last year. So instead of trying to find ways to deal with it, I just cut it out completely,\" he said. Coaches, too, question what it adds When Corhen raised questions about the value of social media amid harassment, his coach, Jeff Capel, understood. In Capel's first few years at Pitt, the team struggled, and the online criticism was loud, he recalled — loud enough to seep into his home life. \"My kids are seeing stuff at home, my children. I'm seeing the stuff, it's affecting me,\" he said. \"I made the decision then that I don't need this, I don't want this, I can't do this anymore. So I just completely pulled away.\" Now, he must coach his players through those decisions, too. \"The thing that I tell them is that the main way in basketball that you can make money is to be a good basketball player,\" Capel said. \"So if social media is causing you to be emotional, or to not be in the right mind state, or to react a certain way, or whatever — then I think you should really think about removing it.\" For female athletes, there's an added pressure: a feeling of responsibility for helping to build the audience for the sport as a whole. The ongoing surge of interest in women's sports was sparked by college basketball players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark and LSU's Angel Reese, who were already social media stars while they were still in school. \"Without social media would we still be where we are now as a sport, as women's basketball players?\" said Hannah Hidalgo, the Notre Dame guard and a favorite to win player of the year awards. Before Brooke Wyckoff became the coach at Florida State, she played there in the late 1990s then spent nine years in the WNBA. It was a very different time for women's basketball. \"Nobody even was paying attention if I performed poorly,\" she said. \"There was no social media. In the newspaper the next day, it might show up this big,\" she joked, holding her index finger and thumb an inch apart. Now, her staff at FSU includes a creative content team, and her team's off-court obligations include regular photo and video shoots, which are also now part of the recruiting process. Wyckoff says she has spent a lot of time debating whether the time and effort spent on social media content are worthwhile. She still hasn't reached a conclusion. \"It's what you have to do these days. It's standard operating procedure,\" she said. \"But it doesn't help us put points on the board.\" But what's not up for debate, she added, is that schools cannot provide players with social media content without also teaching them how to use the platforms responsibly. \"As we are encouraging them and providing them content so that they can build their brand, we also have a responsibility to educate them and to help them set up boundaries that are going to protect their mental health, or protect them in general,\" Wyckoff said. Finding a way to be \"regular\"  Even those with social media accounts have long since wised up to the risks of posting anything too personal. \"Everybody's watching you, and haters are watching, too,\" said Deck of SMU. \"They want to go to your social media to find something to say about you. So just don't give anybody anything room to say.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Deck raised the example of Ja Morant, the NBA star who was suspended twice in 2023 after waving a handgun on two separate Instagram Live streams. In total, Morant missed 33 games and lost millions of dollars in salary. (This fall, while livestreaming on Twitch, Morant said, \"I don't even like IG no more, man. IG changed my life.\") Last spring, Notre Dame's Hidalgo ignited an online furor when she reposted a video of the conservative commentator Candace Owens calling gay marriage a sin. Afterward, Hidalgo apologized in a letter  published by the Players' Tribune . \"I've always been very private, and learning how to navigate the media in public as a young person is just plain hard,\" she wrote. Even after that, it's still a shock to see how much she is talked about and scrutinized, both for what she does on the court and what she does off it, she told NPR last month. \"It's like a rock and a hard place,\" she said. \"I'm regular. I'm typical. I just put a ball in a hoop every couple of days.\" Now, one upside of the end of an athlete's career may be that their time on social media can end, too. Reniya Kelly of the University of North Carolina is one of the nation's top point guards — and a self-professed social media hater. \"You guys will never see me on TikTok unless I'm forced to literally do it or someone pays me,\" she said. \"I think it takes away the fun of the game. There's a lot of pressure and outside noise that comes in with social media.\" She already has a vision for her retirement from basketball. \"I want to be a farmer. I love land. I love fishing. I love having my own crops. I want to live off my own land,\" she says. Kelly is a junior now, with a chance at a career in the WNBA. After that, there'll be nothing stopping her from going off the grid. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   College athletes can earn a lot of money through social media by building a brand and putting up sponsored posts. But social media has gotten much more toxic, especially with the rise of sports gambling. Now many people in college sports are asking themselves, is this worth it? NPR's Becky Sullivan has the story. BECKY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: In real life, it would be hard to imagine a stranger harassing Cam Corhen. He's 21 years old, 6 foot 10, 235 pounds of muscle across his big frame. And he's a Division I college athlete - a basketball player for the Pittsburgh Panthers. None of that, though, stops people on the internet. CAM CORHEN: Especially with this sports betting and everything now, it's just so different. After the games, you'll check your DMs and people are wishing harmful things on family members. SULLIVAN: He was a sophomore when he got his first really disturbing messages from an angry gambler. CORHEN: And I got hurt in the game, and I messed somebody's parlay up, I guess. SULLIVAN: Corhen had to leave the game early. He scored only two points. His team won. But when he got on the bus afterward and turned on his phone, his home screen was filled with threatening messages. CORHEN: I hope your mom dies. Like, it's some crazy things. And, mind you, these are people on burner accounts, so you don't know who they are or you don't know their identity. And you lost their money, so they say really hurtful things. SULLIVAN: He was only 19, barely a year removed from leaving home. It rattled him. Finally, this summer, he decided to log off entirely. Practically every athlete today has a story about harassment, gamblers, death threats even. But it's not so easy to just quit social media because being online is basically a part of the job description for college athletes these days. Here's Kyla Deck, a guard at SMU. KYLA DECK: It can maximize the money you're making. It can maximize the stage that you're putting yourself on. Like, you know, as an athlete, you want to be out there. You want people to know your name. You want - you know, it puts you in rooms that you might not be in. SULLIVAN: Yet the harassment of athletes online has become an epidemic. In college, the NCAA says basketball players are most at risk, especially around March Madness, when their data shows thousands of abusive or threatening messages are sent to athletes, many of them from gamblers. Some of the threats are so alarming and specific that the NCAA has to alert law enforcement. More and more players and coaches are deciding that being on social media at all just isn't worth it. JEFF CAPEL: Look, I've had people at the university like, you should tweet more. You should do this. And they're probably right. I have to protect my peace, though. SULLIVAN: This is Jeff Capel, Cam Corhen's head coach at Pitt. He himself quit X and made his Instagram private a couple years ago after online criticism had started to seep into his home life. CAPEL: My kids were seeing stuff at home, my children. I'm seeing the stuff. It's affecting me. And I made the decision then that, look, I don't need this. I don't want this. I can't do this anymore. SULLIVAN: Social media has become so baked into the business of college sports now, though, that teams have whole staffs dedicated to churning out creative content for players to post. That's true at Florida State, where Brooke Wyckoff is the head coach of the women's team. Sometimes she wonders, what is this all even for? BROOKE WYCKOFF: We spend tons of time and thought and energy and money on photo shoots for recruits and photo shoots for the team. They're not helping us win a basketball game, but they're helping us get the word out about Florida State. SULLIVAN: Players can make thousands with sponsored posts - ads, essentially - on their feeds. But some have decided that the juice isn't worth the squeeze. North Carolina's Reniya Kelly is one of the country's best point guards on one of the country's best teams. She could be an influencer if she wanted, but she doesn't. RENIYA KELLY: I just hate social media 'cause, like, you need to have it so you can reach different people and get your name out there. But it's, like, at some point, when can you just enjoy the sport for what it is? SULLIVAN: Kelly grew up spending time outdoors - touching grass, so to speak - so she already has a vision of life after basketball. A vision that doesn't involve the internet. KELLY: I want to be a farmer. I want a garden. I want crops. I want to have peach trees, apple trees. I want to have everything. I want to be able to go outside and grocery shop on my farm. SULLIVAN: She's a junior now, with a chance at a career in the WNBA. After that, there'll be nothing to stop her from going off the grid. Becky Sullivan, NPR News, Charlotte.

Busting 6 popular myths about hangovers \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Tuesday, November 26, 2024 • 2:56 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Hangover cures are a dime a dozen. Guzzle a few raw eggs. Take an aspirin before bed. Chug a beer in the morning. These remedies promise to banish some of the nasty symptoms that can come with drinking way too much alcohol: headache, nausea, vertigo, anxiety — or all of the above. But is there truth to any of these claims? Unfortunately, no, says  Dr. Ryan Marino , a medical toxicologist and an emergency physician at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. \"I wish there was some magic drink everyone could have, but there isn't.\"  The only surefire way to prevent a hangover is to abstain from drinking, he says. And once you have a hangover, the only thing that will get you over it is time. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you plan to drink alcohol and want to reduce potential symptoms, practice moderation, he says. That means limiting your alcohol intake to one drink a day or less for women, and two drinks a day or less for men, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Experts break down the science behind six common hangover myths — and explain how alcohol affects your body. Myth: All hangovers are the same. The symptoms and severity of your hangover — like your alcohol tolerance — depends on many factors, says Marino. That includes age, weight, gender, ethnicity, family history, nutritional status, smoker status, mood, health conditions or whether you're taking any medications. \"Your hangover is going to be different from everyone else you know,\" he says. For example, while one person might experience headaches and vomiting after just one drink, another might throw back whiskey gingers all night and wake up feeling tired but otherwise unscathed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In fact, some people may not experience any symptoms. According  to one study , about 25% of people who drink to intoxication don't have hangovers at all. The length of hangovers can also vary. They can last 24 hours or longer depending on how much you drank, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Myth: You can prevent a hangover by drinking water or using hydration supplements. Alcohol increases urine production, so it's true that dehydration can often contribute to the hurt of a hangover. But that's only one symptom of over-imbibing, says Marino. Drinking can cause inflammation, gastrointestinal irritation, disrupted sleep and low blood sugar. It also exposes you to acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct produced when your body metabolizes alcohol, that can damage your cells and tissues. Don't expect products like sports drinks, vitamin-infused patches or hydration packets to work any miracles before or after a night on the town, says Marino. While they may keep you hydrated, they likely won't address any other hangover symptoms. But drinking water or other hydrating beverages during a night out is still a good idea, he says. It can help you practice moderation and remind you to space out your drinks. Myth: A \"hair of the dog\" can stop a hangover in its tracks. Some people think that a \"hair of the dog,\" an alcoholic beverage consumed the morning after a night of heavy drinking, can help cure a hangover. It may offer some temporary relief by raising your alcohol levels and masking symptoms like jitteriness or anxiety, says Marino. \"But your hangover is just going to be pushed down the road.\" A hangover can be a mild form of alcohol withdrawal, according to the NIAAA. Hangover symptoms peak — and likely, feel their worst — when the body's blood alcohol concentration returns to zero. Eventually, that bloody mary you had at brunch will leave your system, and you'll have to deal with the aftermath. You're not doing yourself any favors by piling on, says Marino. Myth: Beer before liquor, never been sicker. Liquor before beer, in the clear. Some people swear by this adage. But in general, it's not the order of alcohol that determines the severity of your hangover, says Marino. It's how much you consume. You're likely to drink more alcohol in a shorter amount of time if you kick off your night with hard liquor, he says. It makes you inebriated faster -- and you may feel inclined to drink more than you would slowly sipping a beer. Some kinds of liquors may make hangovers more unpleasant. According to research, dark liquors like bourbon and brandy contain higher levels of congeners, or the chemicals produced during the fermentation process that give an alcohol its distinctive taste, smell and color. Generally speaking,  the more congeners an alcohol has, the worse the hangover is likely to be. Myth: Taking painkillers before bed can help you get ahead of hangover symptoms. While it's a common practice to reach for over-the-counter pain relievers to try and minimize your headache in the morning, Marino says you could potentially do a lot more harm than good. Consuming just one alcoholic drink a day with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil, Aleve or aspirin can increase your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding by 37%,  according to the NIAAA. When you combine alcohol with drugs containing acetaminophen, like Tylenol, you run the risk of liver damage, according to the NIAAA. Ingesting too much of one or both substances can be toxic to the liver. For that reason, the Food and Drug Administration advises against drinking when taking any medicine that includes acetaminophen. If you're taking any type of medication, proceed with caution, says Marino.  \" Even if your medication doesn't have a label that says 'Do not take with alcohol', that doesn't mean you can't be affected.\" Myth: Hangover symptoms are physical. It can also affect your mental health. Drinking too much can make you feel overwhelmed, irritated or on edge. And there's a term for it that's been trending on social media: \"hangxiety.\" While alcohol can initially have a calming effect, your body can rebound as it leaves your system, causing a surge in adrenaline, a racing heartbeat or feelings of worry or stress, says  Dr. Nzinga Harrison , a physician specializing in psychiatry and addiction medicine. It's a tricky symptom to identify. You can experience hangxiety after even just one drink, says Harrison. And \"it can come before physical symptoms or without physical symptoms at all.\" To combat hangxiety, Harrison suggests doing activities to bring down your adrenaline levels, like mindfulness and meditation, and bring up your dopamine — like spending time with friends and getting lots of sunshine. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And while the only way to fully prevent hangxiety and hangovers is to abstain from alcohol, she says it helps to go into social situations in the best possible headspace. Before you go to that party, drink water, eat well and make sure you're surrounded by people who make you feel positive and connected. \"All of that biologically and psychologically may not prevent the hangxiety entirely, but will decrease the severity of the hangxiety,\" says Harrison. A quick note: If alcohol is causing you stress or harm, seek medical advice. There are a variety of treatments, including counseling, medications and support groups, to help people who want to end that dependency. This includes Alcoholics Anonymous, which has helped countless people. This  NIAAA guide  can help you find a program that's right for you. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. Today we're talking about that awful morning-after feeling. And if you're listening to this episode, you probably know what I'm talking about. You wake up, and the sun's too bright. Your head is throbbing. Your heart's racing. Maybe you've got body aches or nausea or dry mouth or, if you're really going through it, all of the above. You start replaying the night before in your head and panicking. What did I say to that person? Was I being too loud? Hangovers, man - they are not pretty. And I think intuitively, we know that it's not good for our bodies when we drink that much. But to be honest with you, drinking alcohol in smaller amounts isn't exactly good for us, either. RYAN MARINO (PHYSICIAN, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS CLEVELAND MEDICAL CENTER): Not to say that people need to give up their one drink with dinner. That's not my point. It's just that there is no safe amount. A small amount is not healthy. SEGARRA: Dr. Ryan Marino is a medical toxicologist and emergency physician at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MARINO: Alcohol is a toxin. All forms of alcohol are directly toxic to pretty much every cell in your body. SEGARRA: According to the CDC, alcohol is a leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. It's linked to several cancers, cardiovascular disease and driving fatalities. And yet, we can hear the stats and still head out to happy hour with friends. And I'm sure I don't have to spell out why. NZINGA HARRISON (CO-FOUNDER, ELEANOR HEALTH): If you want to loosen up at a party, alcohol works. If you want to go to sleep - for most people - alcohol will make you sleepy. If you have anxiety, alcohol will take the anxiety off. If you want to de-stress after a long day, alcohol will do that. And so it's effective until it becomes the problem. SEGARRA: Dr. Nzinga Harrison is a physician specializing in psychiatry and addiction medicine. She's also the co-founder and chief medical officer of Eleanor Health, a company that provides mental health and substance use disorder treatment services. Now, this doesn't mean she came to this story riding on a high horse, though. HARRISON: I have definitely had a hangover. I am personally familiar as well as professionally. SEGARRA: We want to acknowledge something upfront. There is some thought in the medical community that by offering advice on hangovers, we might be glorifying alcohol or even enabling people to misuse it. But both Dr. Harrison and Dr. Marino agree not talking about hangovers isn't going to make the problem of binge drinking or alcohol misuse go away. MARINO: I am not in denial enough to think that people are going to hear that there's no safe amount of alcohol and everyone can stop drinking or is going to want to stop drinking. People really just need to know their risk-benefit profile. SEGARRA: So on this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to help you with exactly that. Reporter Andee Tagle will share helpful insights from doctors Harrison and Marino on how to be smarter and more mindful about your drinking before, during and after a night on the town. We'll walk you through some alcohol science, help you understand your personal risk factors when you drink, and give you tools for assessing your relationship to alcohol. ANDEE TAGLE (BYLINE): OK. Some quick trivia I just have to share to start - the medical term for a hangover is veisalgia, which is a combination of the Greek word for pain and a Norwegian word meaning uneasiness following debauchery. It's a little on the nose but a fittingly large umbrella because, takeaway one, hangovers, like alcohol, affect everyone a little differently. And heads up - it's not just a battle against dehydration. So we know there's no such thing as healthy consumption, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does have a definition for safe drinking. And it's probably less than you think. One drink a day or less for women and two drinks a day or less for men. HARRISON: And one drink is like one shot or one four-ounce glass of wine, not these mega glasses that we have these days. TAGLE: The recommendation is actually five ounces of wine these days, but the point still stands here. So that's your baseline to start. But... MARINO: Every person is going to have a different experience from their consumption from drinking, as well as their kind of hangover experience on top of that. So, like, your water volume hydration status, your body composition, body fat to muscle tone. TAGLE: Your tolerance to alcohol can vary from day to day and from setting to setting based on a bunch of different characteristics. Your age, weight, gender, ethnicity, family history, nutritional status, smoker status, your mood, if you have any health conditions, big or small, or if you're taking any medications. And if we're just talking hangovers, according to one study, about 25% of people who drink to intoxication don't experience them at all. For some people, one evening glass of wine could lead to vomiting, muscle aches and anxiety. But for their sibling at the same dinner table, an entire night of mixed drinks could equal tiredness, dehydration and not much more. MARINO: And so even though we recognize this universal experience of a hangover, your hangover is going to be very different than everyone else that you know. TAGLE: What is universal? Most hangovers are a pain that can last in range from eight to 24 hours, although even that isn't a hard and fast. And they peak when your blood alcohol concentration returns to zero. End of list. Why is there so much variance in the hangover experience? The answer isn't super satisfying. MARINO: The short answer is nobody really knows. But the better answer is that we do know there are a lot of factors involved. TAGLE: See, every hangover is a multipart equation. MARINO: The most important thing is the alcohol itself. And so there is no way to completely avoid a hangover if you're going to be drinking. And that is because one of the metabolites of alcohol, acetaldehyde, which is what your body first breaks the alcohol down into, causes these feelings that we describe as a hangover. TAGLE: Then there's sleep deprivation. Alcohol wrecks your sleep and not just for people staying up late barhopping. MARINO: The quality of sleep that you get if you have alcohol in your system is very low. People get less REM sleep. TAGLE: Next up, let's talk sugar and salt. MARINO: Alcohol also causes pretty significant effects, especially in, like, binge drinking or chronic drinking, on the way your body metabolizes sugars, sugars that are kind of the primary metabolic component for functioning of all processes within your body. And so you can be very low on sugar, and that's why people don't feel good after drinking. TAGLE: To be specific here, alcohol can cause hypoglycemia. That's when your blood sugar levels drop below standard range. Essentially, your liver chooses to process the alcohol instead of maintaining your blood glucose levels, so your blood sugar drops and that can give you some of those classic hangover symptoms - the shakes, the sweats, lightheadedness. So if any of those feelings sound familiar, it might be a good idea to lay off mixers or super sweet cocktails. Alcohol can also famously cause dehydration and throw off your body's sodium balance, certainly another factor of why hangovers can hurt. Dr. Marino says, yeah, it's important to stay hydrated. A Gatorade, Pedialyte or similarly electrolyte-infused beverage before you go out or the morning after certainly won't hurt. But you shouldn't expect them to work miracles either. Now, what about alternating between alcoholic drinks and water during a night out? The doctor says having a nonalcoholic drink for every alcoholic beverage is definitely a good starting tip. But... MARINO: That ends up then kind of encouraging people to drink more or just drinking large volumes of water or something, which can also have risks. TAGLE: And this brings us to the myth-busting portion of our story because there's, like, a lot of so-called hangover cures out there these days. So I asked Dr. Marino could preventing a hangover be as simple as a pre-game vitamin, a party patch or super-duper hydration packets? MARINO: So the short answer, I would say, is no. And the long answer, I would say, is no. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Fair enough, funny guy. MARINO: I'm sorry. That was a terrible joke. But none of these are evidence-based, and there's no reason to believe that any single proprietary supplement is going to treat or prevent a hangover. The only way to reduce your hangover is to drink less alcohol. TAGLE: And that's Takeaway 2. The only cure for a hangover is to abstain from alcohol. But there may be some things that could make that hangover better or worse. Let's start with the old adage beer before liquor couldn't be sicker - liquor before beer, in the clear. What say you, doc? MARINO: In general, that's not going to affect anyone's ability to get or recover from a hangover. TAGLE: So Dr. Marino's verdict - there's no truth to this little ditty. Start with what you want. Mix things up if you like. It's the quantity, not the type of alcohol, that will make the difference for most people. That said, everyone reacts to alcohol differently. And some people will have sensitivities that others don't. For example, an estimated 8% of the global population experience facial flushing when drinking. You might've heard of this as Asian glow because this reaction, caused by a specific genetic mutation that makes it more difficult for the body to process acetaldehyde, largely affects people of East Asian descent. Red wine is often cited as a source of headaches, potentially due to sulfites or histamines, although no one's exactly sure. And in one study, it was found to be a common alcoholic trigger for people who suffered from migraines. There's also some research that points to a specific troublemaker in hard liquor. Studies have shown that darker liquors, like bourbon and brandy, can make hangovers worse because they contain higher levels of congeners. These are the chemicals produced during the fermentation process that give an alcohol its distinctive taste, smell and color. And generally speaking, the more congeners an alcohol has, the worse the hangover. So that buddy that swears by vodka just might have a point. Now, what about popping a couple of painkillers before bed to get out in front of that headache? Short answer - not a good idea. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, consuming just one drink a day with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil, Motrin or Aleve can increase your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding by about 37%. When it comes to combining alcohol with drugs containing acetaminophen, like Tylenol, you can run the risk of liver damage if you ingest too much of one or both substances. That's why the FDA advises against drinking when taking any medicine that includes it. And just in general, it's good to be mindful when you're on any meds. MARINO: Even if your medication doesn't have a little sticker on the label, it doesn't mean that you can't be affected. TAGLE: Now let's turn to food. Having a hearty meal before you drink is definitely a good idea. You don't want to drink on an empty stomach. Eating after a night out won't soak up the booze, as some people might claim - the only thing that sobers you up is time - but it should help with that blood sugar crash we were just talking about. Now, are salty, carby, fatty foods the best for hangovers? Could French fries be the magic cure? Wishful thinking, I'm afraid. MARINO: So I am a big fan of greasy food myself, but this is not going to help the hangover. TAGLE: It's natural to crave fatty, calorie-dense comfort foods, but those won't help you get up and running any faster. Instead, opt for bland foods or the BRAT diet if you're feeling queasy - bananas, rice, applesauce, toast. Or if stomach problems aren't an issue, go for vitamin-rich foods like fruits and vegetables to replenish what you might have lost. Finally, what about hair of the dog - you know, cracking open in a beer or ordering a tall Bloody Mary to drink away the pain of the night before? MARINO: That's definitely not going to help your hangover. It might make people feel better because you're kind of getting some of the desirable effects from alcohol on board. And a lot of the hangover effects are kind of those things people don't like feeling - fight or flight reactions. And so having any sort of anxiety or that kind of thing, the alcohol might help with that temporarily, but you're kicking the can a little bit. TAGLE: And this brings us to takeaway three. Be aware of and tend to anxiety. Thus far, we've talked a lot about the physical side of a hangover. Now let's move into the realm of mood and emotions. Ever wake up after one too many and just feel like crying - lump in your throat, butterflies in your stomach, an amorphous, roving sense of guilt or dread? Dr. Harrison says hangover anxiety symptoms like these are a common experience because of how alcohol works in the body. Without getting too technical, alcohol binds to certain receptors in your body - called GABA receptors - that help you feel calm and uninhibited by slowing down certain signaling. So when that alcohol is eventually cleared out of your system... HARRISON: You get that rebound phenomenon. GABA was turning down that heart rate. Once that alcohol is gone, the heart rate bounces back up. It was turning down that blood pressure. The blood pressure bounces back up. It was turning down that churn in your stomach. It bounces back up. This is the basis for hangxiety (ph). TAGLE: And what makes hangxiety extra tricky is that it doesn't require excessive or even heavy drinking to happen. So you might not even place it as a hangover symptom when it pops up. For some people - especially those who already experience things like anxiety, depression or any other mental health condition - feelings like sadness, hopelessness, worry or panic the day after drinking may be acute and therefore more obviously linked to alcohol consumption. But for others... HARRISON: It can come before the physical symptoms come. It can come without physical symptoms at all, and you're just like, I don't even have a hangover, but why do I feel so on edge? Why do I feel so irritable? Why am I worrying about things? This is hangxiety. TAGLE: Just like physical hangover symptoms, the only way to fully prevent hangover anxiety is to not drink. But one first step to keep your dark cloud from getting too heavy is to simply realize that your hangover can come with significant emotional side effects. And they'll need care, too. HARRISON: Just knowing arms people with the information to say, like, oh, I know what this is. OK, I'm going to hydrate. I'm going to take some electrolytes. I'm going to go be with friends so that I can get dopamine from nurturing. I'm going to eat some delicious food so I can get dopamine from food, right? TAGLE: Dr. Harrison says if you have lead time for an event where you know drinking is involved, prepare accordingly. That means practicing good health and getting yourself in the best possible headspace. HARRISON: Like, try to go into that cruise well-slept, well-hydrated, eating regularly around the clock, with a good sense of connection, you know, feeling a sense of belonging, feeling positive. All of that biologically and psychologically may not prevent the hangxiety entirely but will decrease the severity. TAGLE: From there, she says, if you find yourself going through the ringer, you might start with a warm bath. That'll help wash away the night before and feel more soothing than the potentially harsh sounds of a shower. Throw in some aromatherapy, if you like. Her recommendation - lavender and citrus because they can help the turnover of dopamine. HARRISON: So that's going to bring up that dopamine crater that you're experiencing. Mindfulness and meditation brings down adrenaline. And so if you have a meditation practice or a mindfulness practice or a yoga practice, this will actually help your hangxiety. TAGLE: Now, something you might note here - sometimes nourishing your emotional needs will be at odds with your physical ones. Only you can do the triage there. Like, OK, maybe your body is asking you for a dark, quiet morning and a lot of time in bed. But at the same time, your brain won't stop yelling about all of last night's mistakes and worrying about the next month's problems. In this case, rather than sitting in the dark berating yourself, the healthier choice might be to don some sunglasses, brave some movement and ask your most soft-spoken friend if they're free to join you for lunch somewhere. You can get some comfort food and some sun. HARRISON: And it's not just, like, because sunshine is nice. No, like, actually, the UV rays change your brain chemistry. Actually, the vitamin D changes your brain and body chemistry. TAGLE: Now, maybe you're wondering, when is hangxiety or a hangover cause for concern? Well, medically speaking, they're not usually. Alcohol poisoning, however, is very much a serious matter. Dr. Marino says if someone is vomiting uncontrollably, so intoxicated they can't protect their airway or their mental status is off, maybe they're confused, coming in and out of consciousness, it's time to call 911. On the emotional side, if someone's behavior is putting them at risk of harming themselves or others, you can call or text 988 for free, confidential support for people in emotional distress 24 hours a day. If your scenario doesn't quite meet those extremes but something is still worrying you, Dr. Marino says you can and should still ask a professional about it. You know your own brain and body best. And with that, we've reached takeaway four - consider the cage. Now that we've thoroughly dissected the effects of alcohol and hangovers, we want to introduce you to a tool to help you interrogate your relationship with alcohol - something both doctors agree is a great thing to do, whether or not you're at all worried about your drinking. It's called the CAGE questionnaire. It's an acronym for four simple questions. If you answer yes to at least two questions... HARRISON: This is a real signal that I want to try to change the way I am drinking alcohol. TAGLE: Now, if you only answer one question with a yes... HARRISON: Even though you don't meet diagnostic criteria, it's telling you that the way you're using alcohol is presenting some risk to you. So, like, now, this is an opportunity. TAGLE: The first question, C, stands for have you ever thought about cutting back? HARRISON: A stands for annoyed. Have you ever been annoyed when someone else mentioned your drinking to you? TAGLE: G stands for guilt, as in, you said you were only going to drink one glass, but you drank the whole bottle. You had a few too many and said something you shouldn't have. HARRISON: And then E is for eye opener. Have you ever needed to take a drink the moment your eyes open? TAGLE: Dr. Harrison's score, for example, was two because she's thought about cutting back, and she did, actually. She and her husband stopped drinking entirely about a year ago. And she's felt guilt from drinking in the past. The example she gave us was the time she, as captain of her cheerleading squad, once passed out from binge drinking the night before the big homecoming game. HARRISON: So two represents a significant risk about the way I was drinking back in college and in medical school, right? I can use that information as an opportunity to make a different decision about the way I'm drinking, thankfully, before I developed an alcohol use disorder. TAGLE: So if your score makes you feel like wanting to make a change of some kind, Dr. Harrison has some very simple advice. HARRISON: Just tell at least one other person because that secret makes it scarier than it has to be. And if you have support, that support is nurturing, gives you a dopamine signal that helps your brain think differently about your decisions around alcohol. TAGLE: That could be a best friend or a faith leader, a primary care doctor or EAP at work - anyone who makes you feel safe. And it doesn't have to be some big formal conversation. HARRISON: You don't have to be like, I have trouble with drinking. If you drink every day, I would say, just try not drinking every day and see how it is. And if you notice a difference in yourself, then maybe that's the beginning of thinking about how to make different choices. TAGLE: Of course, it might not just be that easy. Dr. Harrison says it can be really hard to talk about this stuff with loved ones because there's so much misunderstanding around alcohol use disorder. But maintaining that stigma only hurts people. HARRISON: The majority of people with alcoholism recover to controlled use. You don't have to go to 30-day rehab. You don't have to go to AA. Like, the things that work for people are very different, and I just want people to know there are lots of options, and whether you give yourself a label or not, you have the right to choose the role that alcohol plays in your life. TAGLE: And this is the exact message you can pass on if there's anyone in your life who might need it. Just make sure to lead with compassion. HARRISON: You just say, you know what? I was listening to NPR. I heard this doctor talking about the CAGE, and she said, think about somebody you might be worried about. And I thought about you. And I just want you to know if you're worried about it at all, I'm a person you can talk to about it. TAGLE: Then just leave the ball in their court. HARRISON: And they might take you up on it in the moment. They might take you up on it later. They may never take you up on it. But what you did was plant a seed of compassion, which has an opportunity to grow. TAGLE: And even if you feel entirely unconcerned or simply neutral about your own alcohol consumption, it's worth remembering cutting back on alcohol is a game of inches, not yards. Meaning every bit less can be to your benefit. MARINO: If someone's able to drink one less drink a day, I mean, this might be the difference between going into liver failure in 10 years or something like that. And so if people are open to having those nuanced discussions and conversations, there are plenty of ways we can modify the way people consume alcohol to better protect them. TAGLE: Ready for terrible hangovers to be a thing of the past for you and your people? Dr. Harrison says we have to start deprogramming from our alcohol-obsessed culture and start practicing positivity around sobriety. HARRISON: When somebody says, I'm sober curious, be like, yeah, that's awesome. If somebody's like, I'm just only going to drink two drinks tonight, be like, cool. When you - I see you get into that third drink, I'm going to be like, you said you're only going to drink two, right? Like, how can we be supportive about this curiosity and just making it a normal part of the conversation? TAGLE: OK, let's recap. Takeaway one - hangovers hit different for everyone because we're all different and because alcohol wreaks havoc on your body in a lot of different ways, which is why Takeaway two - the only sure cure for a hangover is to abstain from alcohol. However, there may be a few factors, like congeners or sugar content, that may affect the severity of your hangover. Takeaway three - hangxiety is real. Prepare accordingly, and don't forget to nourish your emotional needs, too. Takeaway four - consider the CAGE questionnaire, and share widely. You never know who you could be helping. And don't forget to spread some sober positivity where and when you can. And you're sure the answer still isn't French fries? MARINO: (Laughter) I mean, I think French fries can help a lot of my anxiety. I'm not going to lie about that. SEGARRA: That was LIFE KIT reporter Andee Tagle.

 \n           Thursday, April 24, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The art of letter writing is not dead. Rachel Syme, a  New Yorker  staff writer, learned that during the early days of the pandemic. Longing for human connection, she asked her followers on social media if anyone wanted to be her pen pal. \"I got 300 responses,\" she says. She couldn't possibly write to everyone, so she created a letter-exchanging program called  PenPalooza  to \"connect all these people to one another.\" It now has more than 10,000 members. Those efforts kickstarted a letter-writing routine that Syme says continues to bring her great joy. \"I'm constantly being surprised by what shows up in my mailbox. Creative expressions, intimacies, honesty and beautiful writing.\" They also inspired her to write  Syme's Letter Writer: A Guide to Modern Correspondence , published in January. The book offers tips on how to find a penpal and   write a delightful dispatch — and includes letters from famous writers like Octavia Butler and Zelda Fitzgerald for inspiration. Syme shares practical and whimsical advice on how to start an epistolary habit. ❓You don't need to look too far to find a penpal.  Start with family and friends. If you're looking to get to know new people, ask your social media followers if they want a letter from you. Make a post along the lines of, \"Hey, I'd love to write you a letter,\" and see what kind of response you get, Syme says. \"You'd be surprised how far that will take you.\" 🌨️ Don't be afraid to write about the weather.  A lot of people begin their letters with the weather and apologize because they think it's a \"boring\" topic, Syme says — but talking about the sunshine or the rain showers can be very telling. According to South African novelist Bessie Head, whom Syme quotes in her book, \"The mood of the weather began to explain many other things for me. I think the mind picks on anything to explain the brooding of the heart.\" 🗓️ Letters don't always have to be life updates.  Try a writing prompt instead, Syme says. What's your favorite life hack? What was your most extravagant impulse purchase? Or get creative. Draw a map of a stroll you often take through your neighborhood, with descriptions of your favorite memories in each place. Make your own Mad Libs for the recipient to fill out. You can also skip writing and send Polaroids of snapshots from your life, or personal recipes. 🎁 Sneak gifts into your letters.  Think of flat things you can fit into your envelope, like stickers, pressed flowers, tea bags, paper incense, lottery tickets and iron-on patches, Syme says. Just make sure you're not mailing matchbooks or other prohibited items. You can find a full list  here . 📜 The sky's the limit when it comes to paper.  Syme has used postcards, vintage hotel stationery and pink legal paper (\"because Jacqueline Susann, who wrote  Valley of the Dolls , always wrote on pink notepads,\" she says) to write letters. Other unexpected options: paper napkins, recycled paper from work or tissue paper from a gift bag. ✨ Consider a typewriter.  Syme says if your wrists need a break, you have poor handwriting or just want to avoid screens in this process, a typewriter can help. \"Once you feel the keys crunch under your fingers, it's hard to go back.\" 📸 Take photos of the letters you send.  When you write letters, you're creating an archive, Syme says. But \"what's funny is you can't really see the archive you're creating together with the person you wrote letters to.\" So Syme says you might consider snapping photos of your letters to keep a personal record of your correspondence. 🌇  Some correspondences may fade away, and that's OK.  While writing a letter to someone can feel exciting at first, and a correspondence may last months, years or even a lifetime, inevitably they will come to an end, Syme says. Relationships change over time, and there's no point in being penpals if one or both parties aren't fully committed to it. If you don't hear from someone, remember that \"correspondence is a leap of faith, and that is part of what makes it wonderful,\" Syme says. \"You may never know if the person you are writing to will write you back.\" This episode of Life Kit was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

long.' House members reflect on longest shutdown \n         By Barbara Sprunt \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 1:53 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         After narrowly  approving a stopgap funding bill to end the government shutdown  last night, the House of Representatives adjourned for the remainder of the   week – marking one full day in session after being out for 54 days. The Wednesday vote was the first time House members voted since House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent members home after the chamber passed its initial version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The House did its job,\" Johnson said on the third day of the shutdown when asked why he wasn't having members stay in town. \"The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government.\" He kept his word but   tensions were high when members returned this week. \"Long time, no see. I hardly recognize you guys,\" said House Rules Committee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., at a meeting. \"Where the hell have you been?\" After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., stepped in. \"I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. I worked every day,\" she said. \"I don't want to hear another soul say that.\" Although House leadership in both parties held press conferences every day during the shutdown, there was no legislative business of the House for over seven weeks. \"The halls have been pretty, pretty lonely,\" said California Republican Kevin Kiley on Wednesday. Unlike Republicans, rank and file House Democrats were instructed by their leaders to come to D.C. regularly for caucus meetings.   But  Kiley kept showing up to his Capitol office  throughout the shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering,\" he told NPR. \"I don't think that either party comes out of this thing in the best light.\" Kiley said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of  Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year  – the crux of the shutdown itself. \"That was, I guess, one advantage of being here – that I have had some constructive conversations like that,\" he said. \"But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having the sort of consensus building process that you need to pass legislation like this.\" Other GOP members, like  Missouri Rep. Mark Alford , said the time back home was useful. \"In a way, this time away working in the district has been very, very helpful,\" he told NPR. \"I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been [in Congress]. We went to farms, we went to businesses, we visited 14 of our 18 rural hospitals in our district, and it gave us a real clear picture of where America stands right now and what we can do to help.\" Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the chamber was sent home in the first place. \"I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment. I think it was disrespectful to the body,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Texas. She called it \"poor form\" for the speaker not to swear in fellow Democrat   Adelita Grijalva, who won an Arizona special election in mid-September and was waiting to be sworn in during the shutdown. Grijalva told NPR's  All Things Considered   she thinks her support of the  effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files  played a role in her wait to get seated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I really like this lady. She's going to be an excellent member of Congress,\" Speaker Johnson  said   after he swore Grijalva in . \"We followed the custom of the House on the timetable and we've had a little, as we say in the deep South, some intense fellowship about that. But she's here now and I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn't missed a vote.\" Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., said swearing in Grijalva during the shutdown is just one of the business items of the chamber that should have been done last month. \"For the last 54 days, the House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on,\" she told NPR. \"People are angry about the lack of accountability.\" Stansbury added: \"We should have been here for the entire time.\" Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., agreed with that. \"We were gone far too long,\" he told NPR. \"I didn't want to go home in August [for recess]. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just – that's just more than Americans should have to put up with.\" Womack, a longtime appropriator, said he has his eye on the end of January — when Congress has to finish the rest of its spending bills. \"We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days,\" he said. \"We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   The House of Representatives came back for one day this week after being gone for more than 50. During the government shutdown, the House was officially out of session. Some members did town halls back in their districts. Others came to the Capitol anyway. But as NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports, there was angst on all sides when everyone reassembled. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: The House Rules Committee met earlier this week ahead of the full House coming back into session on Wednesday. And let's just say things were tense. Here's Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the panel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM MCGOVERN: Long time no see. I hardly recognize you guys. Where the hell have you been? SPRUNT: After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx stepped in. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VIRGINIA FOXX: I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. YASSAMIN ANSARI: That's exactly what happened. FOXX: I worked every day. I don't know about you. ANSARI: I worked every single day as well. FOXX: But I don't want to hear another soul say that. ANSARI: We all worked every single... SPRUNT: The House passed its version of a stopgap funding bill in mid-September. House Speaker Mike Johnson then sent lawmakers home. He was asked on the third day of the shutdown, why not stay? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE JOHNSON: My quick answer's very simple. The House did its job. SPRUNT: Then he blamed Democratic leaders in the Senate for not doing theirs. Leadership on both sides of the aisle held press conferences almost every day of the shutdown, but there were no votes, no committee hearings. Wednesday was the first official day back in 54 days. KEVIN KILEY: It's a lot more crowded here. You know, the halls have been pretty lonely. SPRUNT: That's California Republican Kevin Kiley. He kept showing up to his Capitol office throughout the shutdown. KILEY: To be honest with you, this has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering. SPRUNT: He said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Those subsidies were central to the shutdown. KILEY: That was, I guess, one advantage of being here is that we - I have had some constructive conversations like that. But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having this sort of consensus-building process that you need to pass legislation like this. SPRUNT: Fellow Republican Mark Alford of Missouri said the time back home was useful. MARK ALFORD: Look, I've been here for three years. I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been there. I've been able to visit farms. We went to businesses. We visited 14 of 18 rural hospitals in our district. And it gave us a real clear picture where America stands right now and what we can do to help. SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the House was even sent home at all. JULIE JOHNSON: This was a ridiculous thing. SPRUNT: That's Julie Johnson, a freshman Democrat from Texas. J JOHNSON: I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment, and it was disrespectful to the body. And then the speaker refusing to swear in a dully elected, that was poor form. SPRUNT: She's referring to Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in mid-September but wasn't sworn in until yesterday before any votes. The common refrain from Democrats, like New Mexico's Melanie Stansbury, is this. MELANIE STANSBURY: The House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on, and we should have been here the entire time. SPRUNT: Republican Steve Womack of Arkansas says he agrees with that. STEVE WOMACK: Listen, I didn't want to go home in August. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just - that's just more than America should have to put up with. SPRUNT: He's a senior appropriator, and he's now looking down the road at what lies ahead. WOMACK: We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days. We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll. SPRUNT: Funding for much of the government will run out again January 30.

Fourteen years later, the former Duke of York has been stripped of all his titles, including the princeship bestowed at birth. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — as he’s now known — was royally demoted two weeks ago by his brother, King Charles III, and faces eviction from the mansion where he’s lived rent-free near Windsor Castle. But the bad news keeps coming for the man who was once second-in-line to the throne. The recent trove of documents has renewed the sexual assault allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor and undermined his denials that he ever met his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre . They also reveal some of the efforts made behind the scenes to attack her claims. Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II, has vehemently denied all allegations by Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year. But he did settle a lawsuit out of court that reportedly paid her millions of dollars.

The scandal, however, resurfaced in 2019 when Epstein was arrested for a second time on charges of sex trafficking. Giuffre said she was 17 when she was trafficked to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor. In a disastrous attempt to clear his name, Mountbatten-Windsor did an interview with the BBC in which he denied ever meeting Giuffre and said he broke off contact with Epstein in December 2010. He was widely criticized for showing no empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with Epstein. His downfall over the past month began when other emails showed his Epstein friendship lasted far longer than he disclosed. Those revelations were followed by the publication of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir last month that detailed the three times she said they had sex. The new emails undercut Mountbatten-Windsor’s claim that a now-infamous snapshot of him with his arm around Giuffre’s partly bare midriff was doctored because he couldn’t remember it being taken. “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote in one 2011 email in which he called Giuffre a liar. Epstein repeatedly disparaged Giuffre, calling her “nothing more than a telephone answerer.” He discussed getting a reporter to investigate her, suggesting “Buckingham Palace would love it.” When the Mail on Sunday sought comment before publishing a story in March 2011 about Giuffre’s allegations, Epstein forwarded the email to a contact listed as “The Duke” that is partly redacted but appears to be Mountbatten-Windsor. “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” the reply from the email listed as “The Duke” said. “I can’t take any more of this (on) my end.” When he asked Epstein how he planned to respond to the tabloid’s request, Epstein said he wasn’t sure. “The only person she didn’t have sex with was Elvis,” he wrote."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592335","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"We need to get out of here: Trump's immigration crackdown is quietly reshaping where immigrants live in America","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement is driving undocumented immigrants to relocate within the United States, rather than simply leaving the country.

live in America  \n         By Jasmine Garsd \n        \n           Thursday, November 13, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         A woman named \"E\" was at a clothing store in Tampa, Florida with her daughter when she realized it was time to leave. It was her daughter's 15th birthday, and she wanted to buy her an outfit. She says she felt the salespeople giving them looks. \"Real ugly looks,\" she says. \"They could call immigration,\" she recalls telling her daughter. \"You're an American citizen, but you're also Hispanic. We need to get out of here.\" They left the store, she says, with the feeling that it was also time to leave the state. The question this family is grappling with is: where to? Under the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, many are deciding to hide in place, while others are self-deporting. But there's also anecdotal evidence that people are relocating, from cities with aggressive immigration enforcement to places with fewer raids, where they feel safer. E. asked that we only use her first initial, because she and her husband are both undocumented. She says she'd like to go back to Guatemala as soon as possible. Her daughter, who recently started high school, wants to stay   in Florida .  So does her husband, who feels that after some 20 years living in the U.S., this is home. But under the leadership of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, Florida has embarked on one of the strictest immigration crackdowns in the nation, vowing to lead the way in President Trump's campaign. Her husband's workplace - a construction site - was recently raided. He just happened to be out that day. And the family knows multiple people who've been deported, including their own church pastor. For now, the family has decided to leave Florida for a small town in Michigan. A neighbor friend, also an immigrant, just moved there. \"She called me recently,\" E. says, and she told me, 'why don't you come up here? Things are quiet here. You don't hear about raids. And I can find you a job.'\" It's hard to track the movement of undocumented immigrants throughout the U.S. There are no exact numbers. Demographer Matt Brooks at Florida State University studies  these population flows , and says we've been seeing clear trends since at least the 1980s. \"There's definitely a pattern and on the aggregate these patterns make a lot of sense.\"    Brooks says immigration to the U.S. is often a multi-step process: migrants tend to first land in big cities, but in time they make  a second move , increasingly to the South or the Midwest, seeking out jobs in agriculture or manufacturing. And, he says, sometimes there's a third move: away from immigration enforcement to   cities and towns that seem safer. Brooks points to Mississippi as an example. In 2019, there was a  massive immigration raid  at multiple food-processing plants near Jackson. \"We know that immigrants have been leaving Mississippi ever since,\" he says. Following that raid, he points out \"the flow of immigrants out of MIssissippi is more than double the flow in.\" The Trump administration hasn't hit its first anniversary yet, but the immigration crackdown is already having widespread effects. The Department of Homeland Security claims  1.6 million immigrants  have left the country voluntarily, what the administration calls self-deportation. There's also evidence of something else: internal migration, as families flee enforcement zones for safer ground. For a Salvadoran man in Omaha, Nebraska who asked to be referred to by his first initial, R., relocating to another state was a panicked, last minute decision. Over the summer, a major raid at a meat packing plant sent shockwaves throughout immigrant communities in Nebraska. The morning after, R. says he sat in the parking lot of his factory, debating whether to go into work or leave the state altogether. \"I feel that I'm in between a rock and a hard place,\" he told NPR.. He's asked for his full name to be withheld because he is worried for his safety, as he is seeking asylum in the U.S. from El Salvador's authoritarian government. He says to be sent back could be a death sentence. A few days later, R. was gone. He drove almost non-stop from Nebraska to North Carolina—21 hours behind the wheel, fueled by coffee and electrolytes. The destination: a small city his friend said was safe, where immigration raids were rare or non-existent. When he got there, he went straight to work at his new roofing gig. That was five months ago. NPR recently checked in with him. \"It's been quiet here,\" he says. He wouldn't say he's happy, but there are fewer Hispanics, \"so the town just isn't a big immigration enforcement target.\" At least for now. He's hoping it stays that way. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Some people without legal status are deciding to self-deport, to leave the United States in response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Other people are changing where they live within the country. They move from cities with aggressive immigration enforcement to places where they feel more protected. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports.

It was her daughter's 15th birthday, and she wanted to buy her an outfit. E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: She felt the salespeople giving them looks, real ugly looks, she says. E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: She told her daughter, \"they could call immigration and they'll take us. You're an American citizen, but you're also Hispanic. Let's get out of here,\" she said. The question this family is grappling with is, where to? E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: E says she wants to go back to Guatemala desperately. Her husband wants to stay in the U.S., so does their daughter. She asked that we only use her first initial because she and her husband are both undocumented. The couple has lived in Tampa, Florida, for some two decades. Her husband's workplace, a construction site, was recently raided. He just happened to be out that day. And the family knows multiple people who've been deported, including their own church pastor. So they decided to leave Florida for a small town in Michigan. A neighbor friend, also an immigrant, just moved there. E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"She called me recently,\" E says, \"and she tells me, why don't you come up here?\" E: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"Things are quiet here. You don't hear about raids, and I can find you a job,\" she recalls the neighbor telling her. It's hard to track the movement of undocumented immigrants throughout the U.S. There are no exact numbers. Demographer Matt Brooks at Florida State University studies these population flows, and he says we've been seeing clear trends since at least the 1980s. MATT BROOKS: There's definitely a pattern. On the aggregate population level that demographers study, these patterns make a lot of sense. GARSD: Brooks says immigrants often land in big cities, but then they make a second move, increasingly to the South or Midwest for jobs in agriculture or manufacturing. And then sometimes there's a third move, away from immigration enforcement to cities and towns that seem safer. BROOKS: For example, in 2019, in Mississippi, there was the largest single-day immigration raid. We know that immigrants have been leaving Mississippi ever since. So the flow of immigrants out of Mississippi is more than double the flow in. GARSD: The Trump administration claims that more than 1.6 million immigrants have self-deported since the president returned to office. But there's also anecdotal evidence that immigrants are relocating within the U.S. to get away from enforcement target areas. R: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: Over the summer, in Omaha, Nebraska, there was a major raid at a meatpacking plant. R: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: The morning after, a Salvadoran man - who asked that we refer to him by his first initial, R, because he's worried about his safety as an asylum-seeker - sent NPR this audio message. It was 4 a.m. He was sitting in the factory's parking lot, debating whether to go into work or leave Nebraska. He chose to leave. R: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: A few days later, R drove nonstop to North Carolina. A friend had told him about a roofing job in a small city where few, if any, immigration raids have taken place. R: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: He drove 21 hours straight, drinking coffee and electrolytes. And when he got there, he went straight to work at his new roofing gig. That was five months ago. NPR recently checked in with him. R: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"It's been quiet here,\" he says. He wouldn't say he's happy, but there are fewer Hispanics. So the place isn't a big immigration enforcement target, at least for now. He's hoping it stays that way.

Okla. (AP) — A leaking tanker truck spewed dangerous ammonia gas outside a hotel overnight, filling its hallways with fumes and forcing hundreds of nearby residents of a small Oklahoma city to evacuate, authorities said Thursday. Several dozen people were treated at hospitals. Officials lifted a shelter-in-place order Thursday morning, hours after firefighters wearing gas masks went door to door in Weatherford, waking people up and telling them to leave because of the anhydrous ammonia leak. An oil field worker staying at the hotel where the truck had been parked said he heard a “faint pop” Wednesday night and noticed a smell minutes later. He and a coworker left their room and hustled into a hallway and then an elevator filling up with a pungent odor. Once outside, they saw their vehicles underneath a cloud of ammonia, said Michael Johnson, of Nacogdoches, Texas. “The smell itself punched me,” he said. AP AUDIO: Ammonia gas leak from a tanker truck in Oklahoma sickens dozens and forces evacuations AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on a toxic gas leak in Oklahoma. He took off running, but noticed his roommate wasn’t with him and saw that he had run for their trucks. He said a police officer managed to save his coworker. “His lips were purple and frozen shut,” Johnson said. “His eyes were bloodshot red.

Follow on Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers. Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said. At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day. A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds (11,340 kilograms) of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes. Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago, five people died in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan. The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles (115 kilometers) west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said. “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials. The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.” The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said. Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard. Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety. Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said. Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part. I know it’s your house, but you really have to go.” ___ McCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire, and Brumfield reported from Cockeysville, Maryland.

The bill passed Wednesday night   despite Republicans' narrow margin in the House. Six Democrats   joined their Republican colleagues to get the bill over the finish line 43 days after the shutdown began: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Adam Gray of California, Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Tom Suozzi of New York. Two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida -- voted no. The final vote was 222 to 209. President Trump signed the bill shortly after the House vote. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown at the signing event in the Oval Office.  \"This was an easy extension but they didn't want to do it the easy way,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do it the hard way.\" In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a  court battle  because of the shutdown. The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs. But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown —  extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year  — is not addressed in the bill. Instead, as part of the  deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators , Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies. That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure. Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. A lot of pain, not a lot of gain Government shutdowns historically have not been effective tools for advancing a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception. The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party homed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,  voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown  in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government. With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table. But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government. In the meantime,  42 million Americans who participate with SNAP  didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's  order to scale back flights . Millions of federal workers went without pay. The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient. Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, one of the six Democrats who voted for the bill in the House, said there is still an opportunity to address health care. \"Congress still has a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the ACA premium tax credits,\" Golden said in a statement. \"In September, I joined a bipartisan coalition in the House to put forth legislation to extend the credits for one year and now, with the shutdown now over, I urge members of both parties who care about affordable health care to come back to the table so we can get the job done.\" Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he  took a step back  during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who  repeatedly   asked   where   Trump  \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions. What happens now?  Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year. Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage. If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year. Some Republicans have shown  interest  in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps. And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/byheart-baby-formula-recall-botulism-679c822667df767a278b166c7142e68f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"16:36:57+00:00","title":"Parents of Babies Sickened by ByHeart Formula File Lawsuits in Nationwide Outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At least 15 infants across 12 U.S. states have been affected by an infantile botulism outbreak linked to the ByHeart baby formula, which was first identified in August 2025.

2025-11-13T16:36:57+00:00\n\nThe parents of at least two babies sickened in an infantile botulism outbreak are suing the makers of the ByHeart baby formula at the heart of a nationwide recall . Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children’s hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer. Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease. The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and that the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm. Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured. “I wouldn’t guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,” said Stephen Dexter, 44. “She’s so little and you’re just helplessly watching this,” said Hanna Everett, 28. “It was awful.” This photo provided by Hanna Everett shows 4-month-old Piper Everett being treated for infantile botulism on Nov. 10, 2025, in a Kentucky hospital.

No deaths have been reported. Both received the sole treatment available for botulism in children less than a year old: an IV medication called BabyBIG, made from the blood plasma of people immunized against the neurotoxins that cause the illness. Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said. The company sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said.

The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter. “This company potentially faces an existential crisis,” he said. ByHeart officials didn’t respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would “address any legal claims in due course.” “We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,” the company said in a statement.

Stephen Dexter said he went to Whole Foods to find a “natural option.” “I’m a little concerned with things that are in food that may cause problems,” he said. “We do our best to buy something that says it’s organic.” But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn’t thrive on the formula. She had trouble feeding and was fussy and fretful as she got sicker. On Aug. 31, when she was 8 weeks old, her parents couldn’t wake her. Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children’s Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks. Hanna Everett said she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old. “It’s supposed to be similar to breast milk,” she said. Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. When a family member checked the empty cans, they matched the recalled lots. “I was like, ’Oh my god, we need to go to the ER,” Everett recalled. At Kentucky Children’s Hospital, Piper’s condition worsened rapidly. Her pupils stopped dilating correctly and she lost her gag reflex. Her head and arms became limp and floppy. Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Everett said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted. In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. Piper went home this week. They appear to be doing well on different formulas, the families said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

top housing regulator, provided confidential mortgage pricing data from Fannie Mae to a principal competitor, alarming senior officials of the government-backed lending giant who warned it could expose the company to claims that it was colluding with a rival to fix mortgage rates. Emails reviewed by The Associated Press show that Fannie Mae executives were unnerved about what one called the “very problematic” disclosure of data by Lauren Smith, the company’s head of marketing, who was acting on Pulte’s behalf. “Lauren, the information that was provided to Freddie Mac in this email is a problem,” Malloy Evans, senior vice president of Fannie Mae’s single-family mortgage division, wrote in an Oct. 11 email. “That is confidential, competitive information.” He also copied Fannie Mae’s CEO, Priscilla Almodovar, on the email, which bore the subject line: “As Per Director Pulte’s Ask.” Evans asked Fannie Mae’s top attorney “to weigh in on what, if any, steps we need to take legally to protect ourselves now.” While Smith still holds her position, the senior Fannie Mae officials who called her conduct into question were all forced out of their jobs late last month, along with internal ethics watchdogs who were investigating Pulte and his allies. Housing industry rattled by dismissals The dismissals rattled the housing industry and drew condemnation from Democrats. It also gave Pulte’s critics evidence to support claims that he has leveraged the nonpublic information available to him to further his own political aims. “This is another example of Bill Pulte weaponizing his role to do Donald Trump’s bidding, instead of working to lower costs amidst a housing crisis,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. “His behavior raises significant questions, and he needs to be brought in front of Congress to answer them.” The episode marks the latest example of Pulte using what is typically a low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy to enhance his own standing and gain the attention of President Trump. He’s prompted mortgage fraud investigations of prominent Democrats who are some of the president’s best known antagonists, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California, New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Rep. Eric Swalwell. In June, he ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal for the firms to accept cryptocurrency, another industry Trump has boosted, as part of the criteria for buying mortgages from banks. Last week, he persuaded Trump about the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building — a proposal that was widely criticized because it would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.

Pulte is also targeting the nation’s largest homebuilders Pulte also has focused on large home construction companies, which have drawn Trump’s ire. Pulte requested confidential Fannie Mae data and has publicly signaled that he is considering a crackdown if the companies do not increase construction volume. “I’m looking at the Fannie Mae builder data and with the top three homebuilders we buy EASILY over $20 billion in THEIR LOANS!” he posted to X in early October. In a brief statement, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which Pulte leads, did not address questions from the AP, but said the agency “requires its regulated entities to carry out their operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” Fannie Mae said it takes “compliance with the law very seriously and we have a rigorous program to ensure we follow all laws and regulations.” Pulte and Smith did not respond to requests for comment. Currying favor with the president Since his appointment to lead the FHFA, Pulte has sought to ingratiate himself with Trump. The 37-year-old scion of a homebuilding company fortune, Pulte has cultivated a reputation as a hyper-online millennial with a thirst for recognition and a desire to please the president. He and his wife also donated about $1 million to Trump’s campaign, campaign finance disclosures show. When Trump sought to oust Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Pulte became a leading attacker, routinely taking to X, formerly Twitter, where he has over 3 million followers, to excoriate the central bank leader. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that some Fannie Mae ethics and oversight officials who were fired last month had been investigating whether Pulte improperly obtained mortgage information for James, who was charged last month with bank fraud after Pulte sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department. She said the charges, which she denies, are politically motivated. Pulte’s power over the mortgage lending industry is unusual. Not long after his Senate confirmation, he appointed himself chairman of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which hold trillions of dollars in assets. The companies serve as a crucial backstop for the home lending industry by buying up mortgages from individual lenders, which are packaged together and sold to investors. The three competing roles present the potential for a conflict of interest that is detailed in emails reviewed by AP. Like many matters of public policy in Trump’s Washington, it appears to have begun with a social media post. In October, Trump criticized the homebuilding industry, which he likened to the oil-market-dominating cartel OPEC. “They’re sitting on 2 million empty lots, A RECORD,” the president posted to his social media platform, Truth Social. “I’m asking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to get Big Homebuilders going.” “On it,” Pulte posted in response on X. Sensitive data was gathered Pulte turned to Smith, who in her brief tenure at Fannie Mae had become a trusted Pulte ally whose work portfolio transcended the boundaries dividing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHFA, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. Soon, a team at Fannie Mae was overseeing an effort to pull together a tranche of mortgage data, according to emails reviewed by the AP. Smith played a central role and shared the confidential lender-level pricing information with Freddie Mac, which set off alarms at both companies, according to the emails. A spokesman for Freddie Mac declined comment. In the Oct. 11 message to Smith, Evans, the Fannie Mae mortgage executive, also added others to the email chain because they “were involved with this week’s efforts to compile this information” and he wanted to “make sure you do not exacerbate this issue.” Danielle McCoy, Fannie Mae’s general counsel, weighed in, adding that the information Smith provided to Freddie Mac should “never be shared” and “could put the company at risk.” Others who were part of the email chain included Almodovar, the CEO; chief operating officer Peter Akwaboah; Devang Doshi, a senior vice president for capital markets; and John Roscoe, a Pulte loyalist and former Trump White House aide, who served as Fannie Mae’s executive vice president of public relations and operations. Days later, Almodovar, McCoy and Evans — who did not respond to requests for comment — were out of a job. Meanwhile, Roscoe was promoted to co-president of the company, while Akwaboah was named acting CEO. Pulte also got something he wanted. A day after the terse email exchange, Trump posted a graphic to his Truth Social network that featured Fannie Mae’s logo, a list of large homebuilders and the headline “We Give Them Billions.” Pulte quickly reposted it. ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed reporting."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/lamonica-mciver-new-jersey-immigration-newark-d681f7b3f76b235b24c785b3ab485b30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"15:47:54+00:00","title":"Judge Rejects Motion to Dismiss Charges Against Rep.

(AP) — A judge declined Thursday to throw out the criminal case against U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was charged with assaulting federal agents during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey. McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution. U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress. The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on another of one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges. McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong. “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.

McIver has pleaded not guilty and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on The acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision pending. McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison. Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring. McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened. Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest. It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene.

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee initially released three emails where Epstein mentioned President Donald Trump. Republicans on the committee responded by disclosing the bigger trove of documents and accused the Democrats of cherry-picking a few messages out of context in an effort to make Trump look bad. Epstein served about a year in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from someone under age 18 but then went on to renew relationships with many influential figures in business, academics and politics. Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019, a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges. Here’s some takeaways from the documents released Wednesday. Epstein said Trump ‘knew about the girls,’ but it’s unclear what he meant Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. Journalists sometimes reached out to Epstein, perhaps hoping he might have dirt to spill on Trump. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club.

Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year , had said that Epstein’s longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago. Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn’t asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn’t been a member. “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein added. In July, Trump said he had banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago because his one-time friend was “taking people who worked for me,” including Giuffre. Before her death, Giuffre said that she only met Trump once and that he was not among the people who abused her. She didn’t think Trump knew of Epstein’s misconduct with underage girls. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Democrats had leaked select emails to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.” Mentions of former Prince Andrew In lawsuits and interviews, Giuffre accused Epstein and Maxwell of pressuring her into sexual encounters with Britain’s former Prince Andrew, starting when she was 17 years old. Those allegations eventually cost Andrew — now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — his official titles and his royal residence near Windsor Castle. In 2011, Epstein emailed a reporter and attacked Giuffre’s credibility. “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew as many of my employees have,” wrote Epstein, before arguing that “this girl is a total liar.” Epstein wrote that he’d ask if then-Prince Andrew’s “people” would cooperate with the reporter for a story. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre’s allegations. That same year, Epstein, whose writing paid little heed to grammar or spelling, also mentioned Giuffre and Trump in an email that Epstein sent to Maxwell. “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. virignia spent hours at my house with him,, he has never once been mentioned,” Epstein wrote. “I have been thinking about that,” Maxwell responded. In other emails, Epstein strategized how to respond to Giuffre’s stories, which included an account of meeting former President Bill Clinton on Epstein’s island in the Caribbean. “Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ).” Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein’s private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of the women who say Epstein abused them, including Giuffre. Relationship with the press Many of the documents were email exchanges between Epstein and journalists he had longstanding relationships with, or who solicited his insights on financial markets and Trump. He was asked, typically off the record, to weigh in on everything from the president’s relationships with foreign leaders to the impact of oil prices on wealthy families in Saudi Arabia. Epstein offered to broker introductions between journalists and powerful people numerous times. He also contested the accusations against him. In a 2016 email to a reporter, Epstein denied ever spending time with former President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore on his island. “You can also add, fresh politcal juice by stating that Clinton was never on the island,” Epstein wrote. “I never met Al Gore. No diners on the island either, no matter how much detail has been in the press.” ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C. and Michael R.

were all about Bad Bunny. The Puerto Rican superstar won album of the year for his landmark release “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.” After thanking his family and all those who worked on the album, he ended his speech with “Puerto Rico, I love you, thank you.” Those are powerful words honoring a record that doubles as a love letter for his island. The artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio was destined to dominate from the jump. He also won the first award of the night, for música urbana album. Halfway through the show, the singer found himself back on stage accepting the música urbana song trophy for “DTmF.” “I never practice my speeches,” he said in Spanish. And then he showed up for a third time: to perform “Weltita” with Chuwi. He wasn’t the only one with reason to celebrate: Song of the year went to Karol G, Andrés Jael Correa Ríos and Édgar Barrera for “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido.” And Alejandro Sanz took home record of the year for “¿Y Ahora Qué?” Live from Sin City, the 26th annual Latin Grammys were both energetic and eclectic. Take Raphael, the 2025 Person of the Year, who launched into an emotive rendition of “Qué Sabe Nadie” and “Mi Gran Noche,” inviting the crowd to sing along. That was after Santana kicked things off — specifically, Maluma singing Santana’s 1970 hit “Oye Como Va” with the guitar legend himself. It was just the beginning of a memorable medley, talents of today celebrating Santana — Christian Nodal joining in for “Corazón Espinoza” and Grupo Frontera for their 2025 collaboration with the virtuosic musician, “Me Retiro.” Performances hit hard and fast: Aitana brought her dreamy electro-pop, Sanz delivered a medley of “El Vino De Tu Boca” and “Las Guapas,” Rauw Alejandro channeled Puerto Rico in Vegas with “Khé?,” the bachata “Silencio,” “Falsedad” and “Carita Linda.” Then: Danny Lux, Kakalo and Ivan Cornejo brought contemporary Mexicana sounds. Pepe Aguilar followed, with his life-affirming mariachi — “El Cihualteco” into “El Fuereño.” Elena Rose slowed things down with “Me Lo Merezco.” Karol G and the legendary Mexican singer Marco Antonio Solís dueted the romantic ballad “Coleccionando Heridas.” Two of the biggest groups in regional Mexican music – Grupo Frontera and Fuerza Regida – launched into their joint hit, “Me Jalo,” before the latter took over for “Marlboro Rojo.” That’s a cut from their record-breaking 2025 album “111xpantia.” Carín León’s lovely raspy vocal tone carried throughout “Ahí Estabas Tú”; then he was joined by Kacey Musgraves for “Lost in Translation.” Not long after, León took home the trophy in competitive contemporary Mexican album category for “Palabra De To’s (Seca).” Morat brought the pop-rock with “Faltas Tú” and Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso brought a kind of outsider, artistic spirit. Joaquina delivered a full-bodied “Quise Quererte.” Any aspiring artists watching would be wise to take a page out of the Brazilian singer Liniker’s book; “Negona Dos Olhos Terríveis” was one of the night’s most joyful. The same, of course, should be said about norteño band Los Tigres del Norte. The coveted best new artist trophy was handed out to Paloma Morphy. Traditional tropical album went to Gloria Estefan for “Raíces.” Not long afterward, she hit the stage for “La Vecina” and “Chirriqui Chirri,” joined by Nathy Peluso for the latter. Then ranchero/mariachi album went to Christian Nodal for “¿Quién + Como Yo?” Most of the evening’s awards were handed out during a pre-televised Premiere Ceremony. That included: Bad Bunny’s “Voy A Llevarte Pa Pr” winning for reggaeton performance. Argentinian duo Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso cleaned house then, too: taking home their first Latin Grammys for short and long form music video, alternative song, as well as alternative music album for “Papota,” and pop song for “El dia del amigo.” That’s five wins, making them the most awarded act at the 2025 show. The three-hour award show aired live from Las Vegas’ MGM Grand Garden Arena. It was hosted by the dynamic duo of Maluma and actor, producer and musician Roselyn Sánchez. ___ This story has been updated to correct that Maluma helped open the Latin Grammys, not Miguel."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cameroon-election-violence-protests-biya-tchiroma-32aed152d6d7228d58f438ce64cb7cf8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"14:05:57+00:00","title":"Cameroon Protest Death Toll Disputed by Rights Groups After Election Results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of Cameroon’s 92-year-old President Paul Biya winning his eighth term in the October 12 presidential election, widespread protests erupted across key cities including Douala, Maroua, and Garoua, with opposition figures claiming fraud.

Philippe Nanga, coordinator of the rights group A World for the Future, told The Associated Press the official toll is an undercount and expressed concern about the difficulties in accessing the corpses. “About 30 people were killed and some corpses were removed from hospital morgues by security forces and their whereabouts remain unknown,” Nanga said. Cameroon’s Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji had said Wednesday that security forces killed 13 protesters in the economic hub of Douala, and three others in the North Region. It was the government’s first official comment on the death toll since the unrest began. Nji also said over 800 arrests were made. Opposition figures estimate the death toll at 55, according to a Human Rights Watch report published Wednesday. “The violent crackdown on protesters and ordinary citizens across Cameroon lays bare a deepening pattern of repression that casts a dark cloud over the election” Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-trump-government-shutdown-c388d97a4e4acf5cca538fd901e46b2d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"04:33:05Z","title":"U.S. Stock Market Tumbles on AI Stock Worries and Interest Rate Hesitation","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 13, 2025, the U.S. stock market plunged to one of its worst levels since a spring sell-off, driven primarily by falling prices in AI-powered stocks like Nvidia, Palantir, and Broadcom.

worries their prices shot too high. Also hurting the market were questions about whether coming cuts to interest rates that Wall Street has been banking on will actually happen. The S&P 500 sank 1.7% and pulled further from its all-time high set late last month. It was the worst day in a month for the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts and the second-worst since April’s plunge after President Donald Trump shocked the world with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 797 points, or 1.7%, from its record set the day before, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.3%. Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the market after the chip company fell 3.6%. Other stocks swept up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy also struggled, including drops of 7.4% for Super Micro Computer, 6.5% for Palantir Technologies and 4.3% for Broadcom.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Such sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation . AI stock prices have shot so high , though, that they’re drawing comparisons to the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. AP AUDIO: Wall Street drops to one of its worst days since April on worries about AI stocks and interest rates Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett was asked why he thought the market took such a huge hit today. In the meantime, stocks outside of AI also fell across Wall Street as traders worried that the Federal Reserve may not deliver another cut to interest rates in December, as many had been expecting. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they can goose the economy and prices for investments, even though they can also worsen inflation. A halt in cuts could undercut U.S. stock prices after they already ran to records in part on expectations for more reductions. Expectations have come down sharply in recent days that the Fed will cut its main interest rate for a third time this year. Traders now see roughly a coin flip’s chance of that, 51.9%, down from nearly 70% a week ago, according to data from CME Group. Recent comments from Fed officials have helped drive the doubt. Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said late Wednesday that it’s likely appropriate to leave interest rates steady “for some time.” That was a turnaround from a speech last month , when she supported another cut. The Fed’s job became more difficult recently because of the U.S. government’s shutdown , which delayed updates on the job market and other signals about the economy. That left it less certain about whether the slowing job market or high inflation is the bigger threat. The stock market mostly rose through the U.S. government’s shutdown, as it has often done historically , but Wall Street is bracing for potential swings as the government gets back to releasing those updates. The fear is that the data could persuade the Fed to halt its cuts to rates. The “looming data deluge may spur additional volatility in the coming weeks,” according to Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

The entertainment giant reported profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations, but its revenue fell short. That helped offset a jump of 4.6% for Cisco Systems after the tech giant delivered profit and revenue that were bigger than analysts estimated. Another one of the relatively few stocks to rise was Berkshire Hathaway, the company run by famed investor Warren Buffett . He is known for loving bargains and won’t buy stocks when he considers them too expensive. Berkshire Hathaway rose 2.1%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 113.43 points to 6,737.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 797.60 to 47.457.22, and the Nasdaq composite sank 536.10 to 22,870.36. In the bond market, Treasury yields pushed higher, which put downward pressure on prices for stocks and other investments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.12% from 4.08% late Wednesday. In stock markets abroad, indexes sagged in Europe following modest gains in Asia. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4%, even as Japanese tech giant SoftBank Group lost another 3.4%. It’s been struggling since it said earlier this week that it had sold all of its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia. Another loser was bitcoin, whose price fell back below $99,000.

  By Emily Corwin \n        \n           Updated Thursday, July 10, 2025 • 5:07 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Phillipa Munari started antidepressants in 2003. Her doctor recommended one, she said, after she complained of feeling tired. She didn't think it helped, but she kept taking it anyway. When she decided to stop taking the drug 10 years later, her doctor helped her taper off it. At first, this went fine. \"And then, six to nine months later, I started feeling horrible,\" she said. \"I had nerve pain. My neck and shoulders were sore all the time. My anxiety was through the roof.\" These were symptoms Munari had never experienced before. Munari, who lives in New Brunswick, Canada, said she became so exhausted and physically weak she found it difficult to continue her job at a call center. She spent much of the next two years in bed. To receive disability, she agreed to go back on the drug she'd been on, Effexor. She then weaned off it again, this time much more slowly. The nerve pain and exhaustion gradually improved, she said, but the anxiety got worse. \"I had complete panic. I couldn't leave the house,\" she said. Driving in the car, she said, \"I'd be in the passenger seat with my eyes closed.\" It took two more years before things began to improve, she said in an interview as she choked up .  Munari is one of the tens of thousands of people who have turned to online forums to discuss lasting health problems after going off antidepressants. Many say their doctors didn't warn them this could happen, and didn't believe them when they said they were having a problem. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Doctors have long understood that stopping antidepressants can cause short-term withdrawal, with patients  suffering from symptoms  like dizziness, anxiety, insomnia and nausea. What most prescribers and patients don't understand is that \"you can have symptoms that persist for long periods after you stop them,\" said British psychiatrist Mark Horowitz, who specializes in antidepressant withdrawal. According to  one analysis  of patient narratives, people who experienced long-term withdrawal suffered for an average of eight years. Although psychiatrists have been documenting cases like Munari's for decades, no large-scale studies on the problem exist. Because of that, experts still disagree on how common this kind of condition is, how to prevent it, or even what to call it. \"It should be very concerning to the medical system and the public that there are tens of millions of people walking around on drugs whose long-term exposure and withdrawal effects we do not understand,\" Horowitz said. Now, survivors of antidepressant withdrawal and related conditions are coming together online and pushing for education, research and recognition. They say prescribers must inform themselves about these issues and warn patients about them before starting or keeping them on the drugs. \"Before I took it, I had feelings\" Sven Huber found himself Googling depression symptoms in 2009 after reading media coverage of a German soccer player's suicide that November. The symptoms, he said, \"fit on me.\" Huber, a 35-year-old living in western Germany, spent the next 13 years on antidepressants. His doctor first prescribed him one drug, which helped with his depression but made him sleepy. Huber said he then switched to escitalopram (marketed as Lexapro), but that one was even worse. The day after he started it, Huber said, his genitals went numb and his emotions became blunted. He lost his libido, his vision went blurry, his feet felt like they were burning, and his cognition and short-term memory became unreliable, he said. \"It felt like a switch was flipped,\" he said. Huber's doctor recommended he wean off the medication over a few weeks. But immediately, Huber began experiencing sensations like electrical shocks in his head, known in psychiatry as \"brain zaps.\" He grew anxious, confused, and had suicidal thoughts he'd never had before. All of these are  documented symptoms  of antidepressant withdrawal. If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the  988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline  via call, text or chat. Huber went back on the escitalopram. It seemed he had to choose: Endure extreme side effects or excruciating withdrawal. For nine years, Huber struggled to taper off the drugs, failing to quit them five times. Finally, a year and a half ago, he took his last dose. The brain zaps, anxiety and suicidal thoughts all resolved, he said, but the blurry vision, burning feet, sexual dysfunction and emotional numbness persisted. \"I can't relate to any family members or friends,\" he said. \"Before I took it, I had feelings – bad feelings often – but I felt something. And now I do not feel anything at all.\" This emptiness, he said, is the hardest to bear. \"I would just like to feel like a human,\" he said. Side effects that may never go away Lasting problems after withdrawal like Huber's probably occur very infrequently, estimates Nassir Ghaemi, a prominent psychiatrist and professor at Tufts University's School of Medicine. \"I would say it's an unknown minority of patients who may have this kind of side effect long term,\" he said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But doctors who specialize in antidepressant withdrawal say the true risk of severe and lasting symptoms may be obscured by the fact that many patients try and fail to stop the drugs. \"I've never seen anybody come off long-term Effexor or Cymbalta and not have years of trouble,\" said Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. While these two drugs are known to be harder to stop, Horowitz said he also frequently sees severe and lasting problems among patients coming off drugs with less risk for withdrawal, like fluoxetine (marketed as Prozac) and escitalopram. For some people, Horowitz said, these symptoms only begin after stopping the drug, while for others, the symptoms begin like side effects during treatment and get worse after stopping. While patients and researchers often refer to lasting symptoms as \"protracted withdrawal,\" Horowitz and other specialists have suggested terms like \"serotonin-induced neurological dysfunction\" or \"antidepressant withdrawal injury\" as umbrella terms for the phenomena. In  survey results published this year  Horowitz found the longer someone stays on antidepressants, the more likely they are to suffer from severe and long-lasting conditions after stopping them. Ghaemi and Horowitz both said it's important for anyone considering it not to stop antidepressants cold turkey, but rather to carefully taper off of them. Antidepressants can be helpful for short-term relief, said Ghaemi. But for depression, they are most effective in the first six months of use, he said, and \"shouldn't be given routinely for years and decades. I think that's where we're running into problems.\" For certain conditions, he adds, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, long-term use may be recommended. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes Cymbalta and Prozac, and AbbVie, which makes Lexapro, declined to comment for this story. APM Reports and NPR could not reach Viatris, which makes Effexor, for comment. \"That's historic\" Huber was relieved to learn he wasn't alone when he discovered online forums full of people with stories like his, he said. On a  Reddit page  geared specifically toward people with PSSD, or post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, people talk about having \"genital anesthesia\" and no libido while taking and after stopping antidepressants. Many also share the emotional numbness Huber described, saying they can no longer experience love, joy or pleasure, a phenomenon doctors call anhedonia. Reading these, \"I knew I wasn't crazy,\" Huber said. But it was scary to learn how long people were suffering for, and that there wasn't a cure. That page has grown from 700 to 16,000 subscribers over the past five years. Other groups have grown too. A forum called  Surviving Antidepressants  has 23,000 members. A Facebook group that helps users taper off the antidepressant Cymbalta has 43,000 members.   Many more exist on different platforms, for specific drugs and in various languages. While pharmaceutical companies have poured billions into efforts to show antidepressants work, relatively few studies have explored the drugs' negative effects. Frustrated by the absence of research, advocates are lobbying governments and the medical establishment to fund studies that could reveal the conditions' prevalence, causes, and possible cures. Some patients are spending their own money on research. The nonprofit PSSD Network has raised more than $200,000 for research over the past two years, which it directs to a research team at the University of Milan, in Italy. And in response to pressure from the Canadian PSSD Society, the Canadian government recently began funding research into PSSD through small grants through the University of British Columbia. \"That's historic,\" Nick Alves, a spokesperson for the PSSD Network, said   about this kind of institutional involvement. \"That's huge.\" Another organization, the  Antidepressant Coalition for Education , is pushing people to report their withdrawal experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \"People don't learn this stuff in medical school\" Adele Framer started the online forum Surviving Antidepressants in 2011, following seven years of withdrawal symptoms after quitting an antidepressant. On the website, volunteer moderators share best practices for tapering, often referring to a  handbook  for doctors written by Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. His method of reducing one's dose gradually — by 10% of the previous dose each month over a year or more, for example — differs dramatically from the standard medical guidance of tapering over a few weeks. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Framer has worked with researchers to extract patient narratives from the forum into data that can be analyzed. This data has been used in many published studies. For example, one sought to  establish the duration  and common symptoms of protracted withdrawal. \"There's a hidden public health problem in people experiencing withdrawal symptoms because they and their doctors don't know how to gradually reduce the dosage,\" she said, and \"people don't learn this stuff in medical school.\" Recently, Framer has turned her attention to a new endeavor: a nonprofit called the Psychotropic Deprescribing Council, which she founded in 2023. The council's goals are to develop best practices for tapering off psychotropic medications to minimize risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse, and to inform clinicians about them. And now, the influential American Psychiatric Association appears to be paying attention. Dr. Alan Schatzberg, a Stanford psychiatrist and consultant to the APA, said he thinks depression is worse than withdrawal symptoms and warned \"we would not want people not to take the medications.\" But because the group received complaints about PSSD from patients, he said, the APA's research council has begun to review the literature on PSSD and other lasting problems from antidepressants. It will publish the results. Horowitz, the British psychiatrist, said he welcomes the APA's interest, but a review of the literature will likely be inadequate. \"When you do a review, you're only reviewing what exists,\" he said. Most   existing studies on modern antidepressants, known as SSRIs and SNRIs, weren't designed to assess withdrawal or long-term use. Those that do have findings on withdrawal are mostly focused on short-term symptoms experienced by people who have used the drugs for months rather than years. This makes it hard to estimate the real prevalence and severity of the problem. A review study published this week in  JAMA Psychiatry  suggested antidepressant withdrawal may not be as common as earlier reviews suggest. But the authors noted \"treatment duration in the included studies was likely shorter than in real-world settings.\" Horowitz and many patient advocates said they'd like to see government-funded research that follows long-term antidepressant users' experiences after they stop the drugs. Whether this is likely in the U.S. is uncertain. On the one hand, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an outspoken critic of antidepressants. On the other hand, the Trump administration has cut federal funding for biomedical research, as well as  staffing at federal health agencies . Horowitz said he believes the APA's literature review is a sign patients and advocates are being heard. \"It means that pressure has got somewhere.\" This story was produced by  APM Reports , the investigative reporting unit at American Public Media. \n         \n         Transcript \n         ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   A growing number of people say antidepressants have left them with debilitating symptoms years, even decades after going off the medications. Increasingly, these people are gathering online and pushing for recognition and research. Emily Corwin with APM Reports has the story. EMILY CORWIN: It was 2013 when Phillipa Munari decided to go off her antidepressant Effexor, which she'd started 10 years earlier. Her doctor oversaw the process of quitting, which took a few weeks. And at first, it was fine. PHILLIPA MUNARI: And about six to nine months later, I started feeling horrible. I had nerve pain. My neck and shoulders were sore all the time. My anxiety was through the roof. CORWIN: All of this was new. Munari says she found it difficult just to stand up. To get disability, a doctor told her to go back on the Effexor, which she later weaned off of more slowly. The nerve pain and exhaustion got better, but she says the debilitating anxiety, it got worse. MUNARI: It took over two years for my brain to calm down enough that I'm not panicking 24/7. CORWIN: Munari is one of the tens of thousands of people who have turned to online forums while dealing with long-term consequences from antidepressants. Many say their doctors didn't warn them this could happen and didn't believe them when it did. But increasingly, these symptoms are gaining recognition by academic psychiatrists like Nassir Ghaemi at Tufts University. NASSIR GHAEMI: I think it's important to understand that severe serotonin withdrawal syndrome does happen with these drugs. CORWIN: Serotonin withdrawal syndrome - that's what Ghaemi calls the array of problems that can occur after stopping antidepressants. Researchers have been documenting cases for decades, but virtually no large-scale studies on these conditions exist. Because of that, experts still disagree on what to call them, how to prevent them and how common they are. GHAEMI: I was just going over this with a colleague recently to potentially try to do a research study on it because we don't know. CORWIN: Ghaemi believes long-term effects like Munari's are probably quite rare. But he says severe short-term withdrawal is far more common. What we do know is the longer you take the drugs, the more likely it is you'll have problems going off them. Ghaemi says treating depression is important. GHAEMI: The solution is not for everyone to never take them, but maybe not to be on them for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. CORWIN: To be clear, doctors say don't stop antidepressants cold turkey. It's important to go slow. Sven Huber in western Germany spent 13 years on antidepressants. He says he developed genital numbness one day after he took his first Lexapro pill. SVEN HUBER: And I also developed extreme emotional numbness. CORWIN: Huber says the medication did help his mood, but the side effects were too much, so he weaned himself off the drug. He took his last pill a year and a half ago. But the sexual dysfunction and emotional numbness, they haven't gone away. HUBER: I can't relate to any family members or friends. Before I took it, I had feelings, bad feelings often, but I felt something. And now I do not feel anything at all. CORWIN: Huber says his doctor told him this was all in his head. But on the internet, he found forums full of people with similar stories. And these online networks are growing. Take the subreddit for people with Huber's condition - post-SSRI sexual dysfunction or PSSD. Five years ago, this Reddit thread had just 1,000 members. Today, 17,000 people subscribe. Nick Alves does outreach for the nonprofit PSSD Network. He says patient advocacy groups like his are starting to get attention, most importantly from institutions. NICK ALVES: We just got, like, our first ever grants, for example. Like, that's historic in this. That's huge. CORWIN: These are small research grants funded by the Canadian government. On top of that, Dr. Alan Schatzberg with the influential American Psychiatric Association just told me it has begun looking into the issue. The reason he gave?  Because a bunch of people who are suffering spoke up. For NPR News, I'm Emily Corwin. SHAPIRO: And that story came from APM Reports. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/amputees-from-israels-gaza-war-use-homemade-prosthetics-to-re-enter-life","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:52:21+00:00","title":"Amputees from Israel’s Gaza war use homemade prosthetics to re-enter life","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amputees in Gaza, including children and adults, are using improvised prosthetics made from common household and infrastructure materials—such as sewage pipes, string, and wire—to recover mobility and re-engage in daily life due to the destruction of medical facilities and blockades by Israel.

2025-11-14T10:52:21+00:00\n\nTitle: Amputees from Israel’s Gaza war use homemade prosthetics to re-enter life\n\nSome Palestinians who have lost a limb in  Israel’s war on Gaza  are creating homemade prosthetics to help themselves adjust to their new lives, due to the Israeli destruction of the territory’s medical facilities, their supplies, and the blocking of desperately needed equipment.\n\nSince the conflict began in October 2023, 42,000 Palestinians have suffered life-altering injuries, with roughly 6,000 having an amputation or experiencing severe limb or spinal injuries.\n\nChildren account for a quarter of all amputations in Gaza over the past two years, making the besieged enclave the place in the world with the highest number of child amputees per capita, according to the International Rescue Committee.\n\nOne of them is Rateb Abu Qaliq, a nine-year-old boy who lost one of his legs after an Israeli attack on his house that killed his mother and brother.\n\n“Before the amputation, I used to take part in many different sports,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nSpeaking in the southern city of Khan Younis, his cousin Ahmed Abu Qalik recalled that Rateb fell over when he tried to kick a football after his operation.\n\n“He walked away and started crying as he couldn’t play due to his amputated leg,” Ahmed said.\n\nHowever, with an old piece of sewage pipe and a bit of string, Ahmed and his friends fashioned a prosthetic limb to allow him to join in again.\n\n“Once, we went out to play and found a pipe that was longer than his leg,” Ahmed explained. “We cut the pipe to fit him and tied it with a rope so that he could easily join us in playing football and other activities. Now, he is happy and can do so many things.”\n\nFew Palestinian children who have lost limbs  have been evacuated for treatment  outside Gaza.\n\nIn early September, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) reported that at least 21,000 Palestinian children had been disabled in Gaza since October 2023.\n\nIn total, more than 64,000 children have been killed or wounded in the enclave, the UN children’s agency UNICEF has estimated.\n\nLike Rateb, father-of-four Ibrahim Abdel Nabi also lost a limb after being shot in the leg as he queued for food at a site run by GHF, a controversial Israeli and United States-backed aid debacle.\n\nIt led to the deaths and injuries of thousands of Palestinians,  who were fired upon daily  by Israeli soldiers and US contractors, as they desperately tried to access food for their families.\n\nA month and a half after he was discharged from the hospital, Abdel Nabi said he and his wife decided to use a sewage pipe, some wire and nails to create a primitive prosthetic leg for him.\n\n“The main purpose of this prosthetic limb is to restore my ability to move so that I can support my family and children,” he told Al Jazeera. “I love life and I am fighting to continue living it.”\n\nIsrael’s devastating war on Gaza has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 170,000."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1411-12-20","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a broad range of global events, including human rights concerns in Tunisia, football developments such as Portugal and France qualifying for the 2026 World Cup, political accountability for an ex-leader accused of crimes against humanity, nuclear technology cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea, escalating military actions by Russia against Ukraine, humanitarian crises involving missing victims, and growing skepticism about the long-term viability of AI after years of investment.

(AP) — Blue Origin launched its huge New Glenn rocket Thursday with a pair of NASA spacecraft destined for Mars . It was only the second flight of the rocket that Jeff Bezos’ company and NASA are counting on to get people and supplies to the moon — and it was a complete success. The 321-foot (98-meter) New Glenn blasted into the afternoon sky from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending NASA’s twin Mars orbiters on a drawn-out journey to the red planet. Liftoff was stalled four days by lousy local weather as well as solar storms strong enough to paint the skies with auroras as far south as Florida. In a remarkable first, Blue Origin recovered the booster following its separation from the upper stage and the Mars orbiters, an essential step to recycle and slash costs similar to SpaceX . Company employees cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on a barge 375 miles (600 kilometers) offshore. An ecstatic Bezos watched the action from Launch Control. “Next stop, moon!” employees chanted following the booster’s bull’s-eye landing. Twenty minutes later, the rocket’s upper stage deployed the two Mars orbiters in space, the mission’s main objective. Congratulations poured in from NASA officials as well as SpaceX’s Elon Musk, whose booster landings are now routine. Related Stories Landmark Paris Agreement set a path to slow warming.

The identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, will spend a year hanging out near Earth, stationing themselves 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away. Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027. Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet’s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty. Scientists will also learn how best to protect astronauts against Mars’ harsh radiation environment. “We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,” Escapade’s lead scientist, Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, said ahead of the launch. “Escapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we’re going to have two spacecraft at the same time.” It’s a relatively low-budget mission, coming in under $80 million, that’s managed and operated by UC Berkeley. NASA saved money by signing up for one of New Glenn’s early flights. The Mars orbiters should have blasted off last fall, but NASA passed up that ideal launch window — Earth and Mars line up for a quick transit just every two years — because of feared delays with Blue Origin’s brand-new rocket. Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the world , New Glenn is five times bigger than the New Shepard rockets sending wealthy clients to the edge of space from West Texas. Blue Origin plans to launch a prototype Blue Moon lunar lander on a demo mission in the coming months aboard New Glenn. Created in 2000 by Bezos, Amazon’s founder, Blue Origin already holds a NASA contract for the third moon landing by astronauts under the Artemis program. Musk’s SpaceX beat out Blue Origin for the first and second crew landings, using Starships, nearly 100 feet (30 meters) taller than Bezos’ New Glenn. But last month NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy reopened the contract for the first crewed moon landing, citing concern over the pace of Starship’s progress in flight tests from Texas. Blue Origin as well as SpaceX have presented accelerated landing plans. NASA is on track to send astronauts around the moon early next year using its own Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket. The next Artemis crew would attempt to land; the space agency is pressing to get astronauts back on the lunar surface by decade’s end in order to beat China. Twelve astronauts walked on the moon more than a half-century ago during NASA’s Apollo program. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a deepening water crisis due to six consecutive years of drought, with rainfall levels down by 81% from historical averages.

provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/epstein-emails-with-author-wolff-raise-journalism-ethics-questions-experts","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:57:39+00:00","title":"Epstein emails with author Wolff raise journalism ethics questions: Experts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly released emails between disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and prominent figures such as author Michael Wolff and former New York Times reporter Landon Thomas Jr. have reignited ethical debates about journalistic integrity.

involving disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has prompted new speculation about ties between the deceased financier and United States President Donald Trump, but experts say its significance stretches beyond the White House.\n\nThe never-before-seen  emails  have added to pressure on the Trump administration to release files about Epstein in the US government’s possession, with a vote in Congress now expected as early as next week. Trump has rejected suggestions that he has anything to hide, and insists that while he knew Epstein, they broke ties in the early 2000s.\n\nBut the newly released emails also raise ethical questions about the role played by acclaimed author Michael Wolff as he appeared to provide advice to Epstein on how to handle his dealings with Trump.\n\nIn the exchanges published by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, Wolff – best known for his bestselling books on the first Trump presidency – appeared to share confidential information before a presidential debate on CNN in December 2015 with Epstein, advising him on how to exploit his connection with Trump.\n\n“I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you – either on air or in scrum afterwards,” Wolff wrote.\n\n“If we were to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?” Epstein replied.\n\n“I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency,” Wolff told Epstein.\n\n“You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he’ll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime,” Wolff added, in his response to Epstein.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to Wolff for comment, but has not received a response.\n\nIn a conversation on a podcast with the news outlet The Daily Beast, Wolff said he was seeking to build a relationship with Epstein at the time to better understand Trump, but acknowledged that in “hindsight”, his comments could be seen as “embarrassing”.\n\nWolff, 72, is best known for his four books exposing the inner workings of the first Trump presidency, including Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\n\nJane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, said any judgement on whether behaviour like Wolff’s with Epstein was appropriate would depend on how the writer’s role is understood.\n\n“Some people are reporters, some are commentators, and some are book authors, and there are some differences in the way that those different people operate,” Kirtley told Al Jazeera.\n\n“If you want to be a public relations person, or if you want to be an agent, those are perfectly valid career choices. But I think that they are unfortunately incompatible with journalism because the public has a right to assume and to believe that you are acting independently,” she continued.\n\n“You can’t serve two masters, as the saying goes, and your interest has to either be the public interest or serving some other interests.”\n\nExperts note that reporters often face ethical and professional dilemmas while cultivating relationships with sources, especially in areas where insider information is highly sought after, such as Wolff’s research on relations between various figures in the first Trump administration.\n\nBut the prerogative to build rapport with sources, especially those with influence, can also raise difficult questions about a reporter’s proximity to the very centres of power they are supposed to be scrutinising.\n\nEdward Wasserman, a professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, said such relationships have to maintain certain boundaries and be balanced with the usefulness of the information being brought to the public’s attention.\n\n“I think that the public has the right to be sceptical of this kind of cosy relationship with sources,” Wasserman told Al Jazeera. “But the answer the journalist has is that this is in the interest of the public, that there’s a redemptive dimension to this. It enables the kind of relationships that will allow people to confide in a reporter, who can then share that information with the public.”\n\nStill, such relationships can also have a troubling inversion, where a journalist might be tempted to offer a source preferential treatment if they believe they might be rewarded with information.\n\nAnother journalist who corresponded with Epstein in emails released on Wednesday, a former New York Times finance reporter named Landon Thomas Jr, also appeared to have a close relationship with the convicted sex offender, whom he informed about a writer named John Connelly who was researching him.\n\n“Keep getting calls from that guy doing a book on you – John Connolly. He seems very interested in your relationship with the news media. I told him you were a hell of a guy :)” Thomas Jr said in an email dated June 1, 2016.\n\n“He is digging around again,” Thomas Jr said in another email to Epstein on September 27, 2017. “I think he is doing some Trump-related digging too. Anyway, for what it’s worth…” he added.\n\nThe public broadcaster NPR reported that Thomas Jr was no longer working for the Times by January 2019, and it had come to light that the reporter had asked Epstein for a $30,000 donation to a cultural centre in New York City. The New York Times has previously stated that the behaviour was a clear violation of its ethics policies and that it took action as soon as it learned of the incident.\n\nIn the case of Wolff, Wasserman also noted that his direct participation in matters relating to Trump, Epstein, and the media raised doubts about the writer’s ability to credibly report on those issues. Those questions may be especially poignant in a scandal that, for many people in the US, has become a symbol of close relationships among figures at the highest levels of power.\n\n“The problem is that Wolff was offering advice on how to engineer, how to play this situation, in a way that’s advantageous to Epstein. And the problem that I have with that is that he then would presumably preserve the right to report on the consequences,” he said.\n\nIt also remains unclear whether Wolff’s relationship with Epstein resulted in the kind of public revelations that journalists typically point to when justifying close ties with sources.\n\n“It occurs to me as important that in this exchange, Wolff doesn’t do anything to illuminate the core mystery, which is whether Trump was a sexual participant in what was going on with Epstein and these young women,” said Wasserman.\n\n“And there’s nothing in this where I’m seeing Wolff even asking that,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/bihar-2025-election-result-who-won-who-lost-why-it-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:13:32+00:00","title":"Bihar 2025 election result: Who won, who lost in crucial Indian state","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 Bihar legislative assembly elections, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), secured a significant victory, leading in 204 of 243 constituencies.

crucial Indian state\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is heading for a sweep in the legislative assembly  elections in the eastern state of Bihar .\n\nThe election in India’s third-most populous state, with 74 million registered voters across 243 assembly constituencies, has been viewed as a key test of Modi’s popularity, especially among Gen Z: Bihar is India’s youngest state.\n\nVote counting concluded on Friday after two phases of voting on November 6 and November 11.\n\nHere is more about the election results and what they mean.\n\nAs of 5:30pm (1200 GMT) on Friday, the NDA had won two seats and was leading in 204 out of 243, while the opposition Mahagathabandhan, or the Grand Alliance, with the Indian National Congress and the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) as the main parties, was leading in just 33 seats, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI).\n\nThe Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which is currently not part of either alliance, was leading in one seat. The All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), another party that does not belong in either major alliance, had won or was leading in the remaining five seats.\n\nAs votes were being counted, two of the most watched constituencies were Raghopur and Alinagar.\n\nRaghopur has long been an RJD stronghold. But for some time during counting, Tejashwi Yadav, the son of RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav and the party’s de facto chief now, was trailing behind BJP candidate Satish Kumar in the Yadav family bastion. This had switched to a 13,000 vote lead for Yadav by 1200 GMT, with most votes counted. If Yadav were to still lose, it will be a historic defeat for what was, many years, the first family of Bihar. He previously won the seat in 2015 and 2020. His father has also won from Raghopur twice in the past, while his mother, Rabri Devi, has won it three times.\n\nPopular folk singer, Maithili Thakur, representing the BJP, was leading in the Alinagar seat, with the RJD’s Binod Mishra trailing by 8,588 votes — another close contest.\n\nPolitical analysts attribute the gains for the key governing party in this election to the appeals Modi’s party has made to female voters.\n\nIn September, the BJP transferred about $880m to 7.5 million women – with 10,000 rupees ($112.70) paid directly into their bank accounts – under a seed investment programme called the Chief Minister’s Women Employment Scheme. Modi’s office said: “The assistance can be utilised in areas of the choice of the beneficiary, including agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, tailoring, weaving, and other small-scale enterprises.”\n\nWomen make up nearly half of all eligible voters in Bihar, where women’s political participation is on the rise. Female representation in the state has historically been low. But in 2006, Bihar reserved 50 percent of seats on local bodies for women, which has boosted their political representation.\n\nFemale voter turnout in the state has often surpassed that of men since 2010. The turnout among women this time was 71.6 percent, compared with 62.8 percent for men.\n\nThe opposition has also accused the ECI of deliberately revising the official voter list to benefit the BJP via a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls over the past few months. Registered voters were required to present documents proving they were Indian nationals and legal residents of the constituency in which they voted.\n\nAs  Al Jazeera reported in July , however, many of the poorest people in Bihar do not hold any of the several documents that the ECI listed as proof of identity.\n\nThe opposition argues, therefore, that this new requirement could disenfranchise poor and vulnerable groups, including disadvantaged castes and Muslims, who typically vote for the RJD-Congress alliance.\n\nIn September, the ECI removed 4.7 million names from Bihar’s rolls, leaving 74.2 million voters. In Seemanchal, a Muslim-majority area, voter removals exceeded the state average.\n\nBihar is India’s third most populous state, home to 130 million people. It sends the fifth-highest number of legislators to parliament.\n\nThe latest vote has been viewed as a key popularity test for Modi, who was sworn in for his third premiership after he won the national elections in June 2024.\n\nBut the BJP failed to secure a majority in the national election on its own, forcing it to rely on regional allies such as the JD(U) to form the government.\n\nSince the national election, the BJP has won most major state elections, and the streak seems to be continuing in Bihar."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a widespread outbreak began in October 2024, with cases reported across all provinces and territories, resulting in over 5,000 confirmed cases and two deaths.

Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:12:47Z","title":"California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom takes a leading role in representing U.S. climate action, criticizing President Donald Trump’s absence and refusal to send top officials.

Trump absence at COP30 climate conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) has opened in Belem, Brazil, with world leaders calling for united action to combat climate change.

unity to tackle climate crisis\n\nThe 30th annual United Nations  climate change conference (COP30)  has started in the Brazilian city of Belem, with leaders calling for countries to take a united approach against global warming.\n\n“In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another – your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, told delegates on Monday.\n\nSome 50,000 people from more than 190 countries are expected to attend the 12-day event, which is being held at the edge of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.\n\nAddressing the conference, Stiell said that previous climate talks had helped, but that there was “much more work to do”.\n\nThe UN climate boss noted that countries would have to move “much, much faster” in driving down greenhouse gas emissions. “Lamenting is not a strategy. We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed at the start of COP30.\n\nBrazil’s leader condemned those seeking to undermine efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“They attack institutions, they attack science and universities,” he said. “It’s time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers.”\n\nThe United States is not sending any delegates to COP30 in keeping with President Donald Trump’s anti-climate change stance.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” the US’s former special envoy for climate, Todd Stern, said of the Trump administration’s decision.\n\nCOP30 President Andre Correa do Lago said the US’s absence “has opened some space for the world to see what developing countries are doing”.\n\nPablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru, urged world leaders to do more than simply give pledges at this year’s conference.\n\n“We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” he said.\n\nIn a letter to COP30 that was published on Monday, dozens of scientists expressed their fears about the melting of glaciers, ice sheets and other frozen parts of the planet.\n\n“The cryosphere is destabilising at an alarming pace,” they wrote. “Geopolitical tensions or short-term national interests must not overshadow COP30. Climate change is the defining security and stability challenge of our time.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reveals that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may significantly improve survival in cancer patients, particularly those with advanced lung cancer and metastatic melanoma.

Data from over 1,000 patients showed that those vaccinated before starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer, with survival rates nearly doubling in lung cancer cases. These findings, supported by both clinical data and mouse experiments, suggest that mRNA vaccines could serve as a universal, off-the-shelf tool to reprogram immune responses against cancer.

mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/is-venezuela-prepared-for-a-us-attack-as-washington-ramps-up-forces","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:27:41Z","title":"Is Venezuela prepared for a US attack, as Washington ramps up forces?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela has launched a massive military mobilization of nearly 200,000 troops in response to a significant U.S. military escalation, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R.

What are its military capabilities? And what might be the calculus driving the decisions of US President Donald Trump and Maduro, respectively?\n\nTensions between Washington and Caracas have been spiralling for weeks, as the Trump administration has hit a series of boats in the Caribbean Sea and, more recently, the Pacific Ocean, claiming they were carrying individuals smuggling narcotics into the US.\n\nThe 20th strike took place this week, US officials have said. In all, about 80 people have been killed. The Trump administration has not presented any evidence to back its assertion that the bombed boats had narcotics or drug smugglers on them, or that the vessels were even headed to the US. It has also not offered any legal justification for its actions, which many experts believe violate international law.\n\nAt the centre of Washington’s allegations is an unsubstantiated claim that Venezuela’s Maduro is driving the narcotics smuggling to the US in cahoots with cartels.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has dispatched the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group into Caribbean and Latin American waters, a powerful naval formation built around the world’s most advanced and largest aircraft carrier.\n\nAn aircraft carrier is a floating airbase – a warship that can launch, land, refuel, and arm military aircraft at sea.\n\nThe Ford is a nuclear-powered supercarrier equipped with advanced technology, sailing alongside guided-missile destroyers and support ships, with more than 4,000 personnel and dozens of tactical aircraft ready for rapid deployment.\n\n#Venezuela : I've often described the USS Gerald R. Ford in the media as a \"floating fortress of American power.\" Some facts and figures showing why:  pic.twitter.com/f53PeACIOB\n\n— Ryan Berg, PhD (@RyanBergPhD)  November 12, 2025\n\nAs Washington expands its military presence in the region, analysts say the stated goals of the mission have broadened and may not fully align with the capabilities of the forces being deployed.\n\n“The administration has said that the deployment is to stop the flow of illegal drugs to the US, and also to degrade the cartels, but over time the US goal has expanded to include anti-Maduro regime activities,” said Mark Cancian, senior adviser in the defence and security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in an analysis posted on X early on Friday.\n\nCancian noted that the carrier may not be fully optimised for the mission as described. “The Ford is not well suited for counter-drug operations… It’s well suited to attack adversaries either at sea or on land.”\n\nHe also pointed out that the deployment of the Ford cannot be indefinite.\n\n“There are demands around the world for its presence because it’s such a powerful military asset, and eventually it’ll have to go home – so Southern Command will need to either use it or stand down,” he said, referring to the US military command under which the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean fall.\n\nOn Tuesday, Venezuela’s government announced a “massive” mobilisation of troops and civilians to prepare for any potential US action.\n\nVenezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez announced a “higher phase” of the Independence Plan 200, a military response mechanism ordered in September to strengthen defence measures against the US presence in the Caribbean.\n\n“Nearly 200,000 troops have been deployed throughout the national territory for this exercise,” Padrino Lopez added.\n\nThe exercise was scheduled to start Tuesday and end on Wednesday.\n\nPadrino Lopez also stressed that the country’s military forces were united. He said “more than 90 percent of the people reject any aggression against Venezuela,” dismissing opposition groups he described as “minority, subversive, [and] fascist”, and claiming they “no longer exist” in the national political landscape.\n\nHe framed the mobilisation as part of a broader stand against “imperialist aggression” and Washington’s attempts to act as “the world’s hegemon” and “the world’s police”, insisting that Venezuela remains committed to its independence, liberty and sovereignty.\n\nAccording to analysts, Venezuela’s armed forces indeed are – for the most part – closely tied, politically, economically, and institutionally to the movement known as Chavismo that has shaped the Venezuelan state for more than 20 years.\n\nThe military doctrine is based on policies laid out by the late Hugo Chavez, and it is based on members being “patriotic, popular and anti-imperialist”. Maduro took over as president after Chavez died in 2013.\n\n“I don’t think that the Venezuelan government and the military are going to fracture only because of threats,” Elias Ferrer, founder of Orinoco Research and the lead editor of Venezuelan media organisation Guacamaya, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Because of the way they think in front of threats, they’ve always stuck together and strengthened their position,” he added.\n\nAccording to Global Firepower’s 2025 Military Strength Ranking, Venezuela places 50th worldwide out of 160 countries assessed in terms of military capabilities.\n\nWithin Latin America, it ranks seventh.\n\nIt falls behind regional militaries such as those of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, and sits in a similar range to Colombia, Chile, and Peru.\n\nAccording to a report released by CSIS this week, Venezuela’s air force is small and only partially functional.\n\nRoughly 30 of its 49 aircraft are believed to be operational, and only three F-16s can still fly, due to a lack of spare parts caused by US sanctions.\n\nAccording to Military.com, a platform focused on the US military and veteran community, Venezuela has invested billions in Russian-made weapons systems, including missiles and fighter jets, intended to deter or challenge US ships and aircraft.\n\nVenezuela has at least 21 operational Su-30s, a Russian fighter aircraft developed in the 1980s.\n\nThe Su-30s can be armed with supersonic antiship missiles, such as the Kh-31A, which are a significant threat to naval warships operating near Venezuela.\n\nThe CSIS report notes that in the event of a conflict, Venezuelan airfields and aircraft would likely be among the first US targets. The US has deployed F-35 stealth fighters to the region, and they are likely intended to counter both Venezuelan fighter-jet manoeuvres and the country’s air-defence systems.\n\nOn the ground, however, the analysis suggests that Venezuela maintains a significantly larger troop presence and greater firepower than the limited US forces currently positioned offshore.\n\nAccording to Global Firepower, from a total population of 31 million, the Venezuelan military has an active military personnel of 337,000. Of them, 109,000 are active members, 220,000 belong to paramilitary forces, and the remaining 8,000 are reserve personnel.\n\nBut experts say these numbers mask a more troublesome reality for Venezuela: Its military forces have been hampered by years of limited warfighting training and a focus on internal security.\n\nIts navy, meanwhile, is no match for the US and its uncontested control at sea.\n\nUltimately, analysts agree that the US is militarily far superior to Venezuela.\n\n“No one can match the power of the United States military in conventional warfare,” Ferrer, the Orinoco Research founder, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“What we need to think about in Venezuela is the capacity of the local armed forces to resist or to make the country ungovernable.\n\n“They can make it so costly that it’s not worth it; that’s how you win in asymmetric warfare,” Ferrer added.\n\nTrump has justified the recent military buildup by arguing it is necessary to curb the flow of drugs into the US. But many analysts believe this is an effort to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe US president has said he does not plan to invade Venezuela, and Carlos Pina, a Venezuelan political scientist, believes Washington’s preferred strategy is indeed still political rather than military.\n\n“I still believe that the main option for the US is not to carry out any armed attack, but to apply enough pressure for Nicolas Maduro to resign and hand over power peacefully,” he said. “In my opinion, that remains the most desirable option for the US.”\n\nPina argued that Maduro is fully aware of this strategy and is responding accordingly. “Maduro knows this, and because he knows it, he tries to raise the cost of any potential intervention,” Pina said. “He also counts on the fact that, both in the region and even within the country, a military invasion would likely not be well regarded or well received.”\n\nHowever, Pina warned that the scale of the US deployment creates political pressure of its own in Washington.\n\n“After sending so much military equipment to the Caribbean, it would be a political and diplomatic defeat for Trump to do nothing, to pull back and leave things as they were before the mobilisation,” he said.\n\nBecause of this, Pina said he expects the US to continue escalating rather than retreating. “Trump will probably do something to avoid that defeat,” he said. “He will likely keep increasing military pressure to force a political change, to initiate a transition. And as the days go by, he will continue building up more force-equipment, ships, planes, even troops in the Caribbean.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/massive-enemy-attack-russia-pounds-ukraines-kyiv-killing-one","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:32:46+00:00","title":"‘Massive enemy attack’: Russia pounds Ukraine’s Kyiv, killing six","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive Russian attack on Kyiv in November 2025 killed at least six people and injured over 30, with damage reported in all 10 districts and disruptions to heating networks.

people with more than 30 others injured, according to the head of the Kyiv city military administration, Tymur Tkachenko.\n\nMore than 40 people had to be rescued as a result of the overnight assault into Friday, Ukraine’s emergency services added, with fires or damage to residential buildings reported in most of the Ukrainian capital’s 10 districts.\n\nA separate Russian drone attack on Chornomorsk, a coastal city in the south, killed two people on Friday, according to Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper. Seven others were injured in the strike.\n\nEarlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X that the Kyiv barrage was “a wicked attack” which killed several and injured dozens, including children and a pregnant woman. He said “about 430 drones and 18 missiles were used in the strike, including ballistic and aeroballistic missiles. This was a deliberately calculated attack aimed at causing maximum harm to people and civilian infrastructure.\n\n“The main target of the attack was Kyiv, and strikes also hit Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa regions,” he added.\n\nEarlier, Kyiv police said an elderly woman was killed, while a 10-year-old boy was among the injured.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko described it as a “massive enemy attack”, saying a pregnant woman and a man in an “extremely serious condition” were among the hospitalised.\n\nA 55-year-old man in Bila Tserkva who suffered thermal burns was rushed to hospital, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, the head of the Kyiv region, who said Russian missiles and drones had targeted critical infrastructure in Kyiv.\n\nKlitschko confirmed that the Russian attack had damaged part of the city’s heating networks, noting that some buildings in the northeastern Desnianskyi district were temporarily left without heat.\n\nBefore another punishing winter of war, Moscow has intensified its attacks on targets including Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, increasing the risk of heating outages.\n\nFriday morning’s attack also struck residential buildings throughout the Ukrainian capital.\n\n“Russians are hitting residential buildings. There are a lot of damaged high-rise buildings throughout Kyiv, almost in every district,” said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city’s military administration.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Defence said its forces had shot down more than 200 Ukrainian drones overnight.\n\n“During the past night, air-defence assets intercepted and destroyed 216 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles,” it wrote on Telegram.\n\nLater on Friday, a top Russian nuclear official said that around eight Ukrainian drones had tried to attack the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant in southwest Russia overnight, but all were shot down.\n\nAlexei Likhachev, CEO of state nuclear corporation Rosatom, said several units of the plant were disconnected from the grid, but operations were restored in the morning.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have each accused the other of risking catastrophe by attacking nuclear sites in the course of the war\n\nThe latest attack on Kyiv comes two days after G7 foreign ministers reiterated their “unwavering” support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and demanded an immediate ceasefire.\n\nAs part of international efforts to hold Russia to account for its actions since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Canada unveiled new sanctions against Moscow on Wednesday.\n\nThe measures targeted the country’s drone and energy production, and infrastructure used to launch cyberattacks.\n\nZelenskyy said on Friday after the huge attack on Kyiv, “All of this must end. A great deal of work is underway with partners to strengthen our air defense, but it is not enough. We need reinforcement with additional systems and interceptor missiles. Europe and the United States can help. We are counting on real decisions. Thank you to everyone who helps.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/uk-judge-finds-bhp-group-liable-in-brazils-worst-environmental-disaster","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:18:56+00:00","title":"UK judge finds BHP Group liable in Brazil’s worst environmental disaster","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UK judge has ruled that BHP Group is legally liable for the 2015 tailings dam collapse at the Samarco mine in Brazil, which released toxic waste into the Doce River, killing 19 people and devastating communities.

The river, which the Krenak Indigenous people revere as a deity, has yet to recover.\n\nO’Farrell said in her ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the “direct and immediate cause” of the dam’s collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.\n\nBHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit. BHP’s President Minerals Americas Brandon Craig said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit “have already been paid compensation in Brazil”.\n\nThe case was filed in the UK because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time.\n\nThe trial began in October 2024, just days before Brazil’s federal government reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the mining companies.\n\nUnder the agreement, Samarco – which is also half-owned by Brazilian mining giant Vale – agreed to pay 132 billion reais ($23bn) over 20 years.

action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/14/live-ukraines-capital-kyiv-comes-under-deadly-russian-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:37:26+00:00","title":"Russian attacks on Ukraine kill 6 in Kyiv, 2 in Chornomorsk","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian attacks on Ukraine have resulted in eight fatalities, including six in the capital Kyiv and two in Chornomorsk.

Korea have released details of a trade agreement that includes a $150bn Korean investment in the US shipbuilding sector, and both countries agree to “move forward” on building nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nUnder the agreement, President Lee Jae Myung said on Friday that South Korea will build nuclear-powered submarines as part of a new partnership with Washington on shipbuilding, artificial intelligence and the nuclear industry.\n\nA fact sheet released by the White House said the US gave approval for Seoul to build nuclear-powered submarines and that South Korea will invest an additional $200bn in US industrial sectors in addition to the $150bn in shipbuilding.\n\nSouth Korea’s official Yonhap news agency said Seoul’s investment was in return for Washington’s lowering of  trade tariffs on Korean goods to 15 percent  from 25 percent.\n\n“One of the greatest variables for our economy and security – the bilateral negotiations on trade, tariffs and security – has been finalised,” President Lee said at a news conference on Friday, adding the two countries had agreed to “move forward with building nuclear-powered submarines”.\n\n“The United States has given approval for the ROK [Republic of Korea] to build nuclear-powered attack submarines,” Lee said.\n\nSeoul also secured “support for expanding our authority over uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing”, he said.\n\nThe joint fact sheet outlining the deal said both sides would “collaborate further through a shipbuilding working group” to “increase the number of US commercial ships and combat-ready US military vessels “.\n\nYonhap also reported that South Korea is seeking to acquire “four or more 5,000-ton conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines by the mid-2030s “.\n\nSouth Korea’s development of nuclear-powered vessels would provide a significant boost to its naval and defence industries, allowing Seoul to join a select group of countries with such technological capabilities, analysts say.\n\nChina had already voiced concern over a Washington-Seoul deal on nuclear submarine technology.\n\nSuch a partnership “goes beyond a purely commercial partnership, directly touching on the global nonproliferation regime and the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the wider region,” China’s Ambassador in Seoul Dai Bing told reporters on Thursday.\n\nNorth Korea did not immediately comment on the development, but is  likely to respond . Pyongyang has consistently accused Washington and Seoul of building up military forces on the North’s borders in preparation for an invasion one day.\n\nDetails remain murky on where the nuclear submarines will be built.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on social media last month that “South Korea will be building its Nuclear Powered Submarine in the Philadelphia Shipyards, right here in the good ol’ U.S.A”.\n\nHowever, Seoul’s national security adviser Wi Sung-lac said on Friday that “from start to finish, the leaders’ discussion proceeded on the premise that construction would take place in South Korea”.\n\n“So the question of where construction will take place can now be considered settled,” Wi said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/unrwa-slams-israel-for-crippling-gaza-efforts-aid-woefully-short-of-needs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:53:19+00:00","title":"Aid still woefully short of Gaza needs as heavy rains, winter approach","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has accused Israel of deliberately obstructing humanitarian aid to Gaza by banning its operations and restricting access, citing violations of international law.

United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has accused Israel of deliberately crippling its operations and blocking the entry of vital aid to Gaza amid its more than two-year genocidal war, as Palestinians face the onset of heavy rains and winter with sparse shelter or relief.\n\n“Safeguarding UNRWA’s mandate and operations is required under international law; it is vital to the survival of millions of Palestinians; and it is essential for a political solution,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini told the UN General Assembly Fourth Committee on Thursday, citing recent findings by the UN Commission of Inquiry and rulings by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) obligating Israel to lift restrictions on the agency.\n\nLazzarini also told a news conference at the UN headquarters in New York that severe funding shortfalls were threatening UNRWA’s essential services, urging donor nations for more money, so that it could continue its operations in Gaza despite funding cuts by the United States.\n\n“We run week by week, month by month. I know that as of today, we will be able to process our salaries in November, but have no idea if or no visibility if we will be able to process our salaries in December,” said Lazzarini.\n\nIsrael has  barred UNRWA from operating on its soil  after baselessly accusing some of its employees of participating in the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, which triggered the war.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly accused UNRWA employees of involvement in the October 7 attack without providing proof.\n\nFollowing those allegations, the US – historically the agency’s biggest donor – suspended its support.\n\nIn the wake of Israel’s decision, UNRWA was forced to repatriate its international staff from Gaza and the occupied West Bank, limiting its food aid distribution abilities.\n\nBut it still employs 12,000 people in the Palestinian territory, and its services are vital to Palestinians, Lazzarini insisted.\n\n“About 75,000 people were sheltered in 100 of our premises across the Gaza Strip,” he said.\n\n“We have, over the last two years, provided more than 15 million primary health consultations. Today, the average is about 14,000 a day,” he added, also noting the agency’s joint vaccination campaign with UNICEF and the World Health Organization. UNRWA also provides education for tens of thousands of children.\n\n“In the absence of a significant influx of new funding, the delivery of critical services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region will be compromised,” Lazzarini added.\n\nWhile US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said UNRWA will have no role in post-war Gaza, in sync with Israeli demands, Lazzarini noted that since the  US-brokered ceasefire  between Israel and Hamas took hold, “we have expanded our services”.\n\nUnder the ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, and which  Israel has violated hundreds of times , aid deliveries were supposed to be significantly ramped up, with at least 600 trucks a day due to enter Gaza to fulfil the population’s needs.\n\nHowever, only “around 150 trucks” have been entering Gaza daily, carrying supplies that are not sufficient for the “two million Palestinians that are currently displaced and homeless”, said Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza.\n\n“There are a lot of Palestinian families who have said that there are no tarps, no tents, and they didn’t receive any humanitarian aid”, despite the arrival of the aid trucks, said Khoudary.\n\nThe lack of supplies, coupled with the onset of winter, is a “terrifying nightmare for a lot of families and especially for those who are living in makeshift camps”, said Khoudary.\n\nThe lack of supplies has prompted the UN to warn that the hunger crisis in Gaza remains catastrophic, particularly in the north, where famine was declared in August, due to the slow and difficult route aid convoys face from the south.\n\nTrucks carrying humanitarian aid and commercial cargo  resumed passage through the northern Zikim border crossing  earlier this week.\n\nIsrael had closed the crossing, the main entry point into the hard-hit northern Gaza Strip, for two months, with its reopening welcomed by Palestinians and UN aid agencies.\n\nPalestinian truck driver Abdulkarim Abu Daqqa said on Thursday that they had loaded approximately 80 trucks and hoped that the crossings would continue the following day to alleviate Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.\n\nA spokesperson for COGAT, the Israeli Defence Ministry body that oversees civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territory, told the AFP news agency that the crossing would remain open permanently.\n\nThe October ceasefire also provided for the release of captives and prisoners held by Israel and Hamas.\n\nIsrael on Thursday received the body of one of the last four captives held by Hamas from the Red Cross, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said.\n\nThe coffin was handed over in the Gaza Strip to the Israeli army and Shin Bet security service, the office said.\n\nIt later said forensic experts had confirmed the body was that of Israeli captive Meny Godard, 73, who was killed in the Hamas-led October 2023 attack on southern Israel.\n\nHamas said the body was found in Khan Younis in the south of the territory.\n\nThe search for the remaining three bodies is going to be “complicated” and “will take time”, said Khoudary.\n\nAccording to an announcement by Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, they require “more tools, more equipment … more technicians” as the location where the bodies are located is “very unreachable”, Khoudary added.\n\nThe remaining bodies are located beyond the so-called Yellow Line, according to Khoudary, which are “dangerous areas”.\n\nThe Yellow Line is a boundary dividing the Gaza Strip into Israeli-occupied and Hamas-controlled zones, established as part of the October ceasefire. Israel has been routinely firing at and killing Palestinians venturing to check on the ruins of their homes in areas it controls in recent weeks.\n\nPalestinians are eagerly waiting for the three remaining bodies to be handed over to the Israeli authorities, “because their lives are on hold. Palestinians want reconstruction, they want to know from where they could start their lives all over,” said Khoudary. “There are a lot of Palestinians who need medical evacuations, and these won’t happen until the three bodies” have been delivered to Israel via the Red Cross.\n\nAt the start of the truce, Hamas held 20 living captives and 28 bodies of the deceased.\n\nIn exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in its custody and returned the bodies of hundreds of deceased Palestinians.\n\nGaza’s health officials have said many of the returned bodies  showed signs of torture, mutilation and execution .\n\nGaza health officials said on Friday they had received the bodies of 15 Palestinians returned by Israel. Their remains were delivered to Nasser Medical Complex, according to an Al Jazeera correspondent. This brings the total number of bodies recovered through the deal to 330.\n\n“Identifying these bodies [of Palestinians] has been very challenging,” said Khoudary.\n\nOnly a small number of them have managed to be identified, said Khoudary, as they have “decomposed, [been] disfigured”. As a result, “it’s very hard for families to identify who these Palestinians are, so that’s why most of those Palestinians are buried without identification in one of the mass graves in Deir el-Balah.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/trump-congress-and-the-epstein-files-what-happens-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:07:11+00:00","title":"Trump, Congress and the Epstein files: What happens next?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives has cleared a procedural hurdle for a bill to release federal records related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after 218 signatures on a discharge petition reached the required threshold.

the Epstein files: What happens next?\n\nA United States House of Representatives push to  release files  related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein cleared a significant hurdle November 12, as Democrats and a handful of Republicans reached 218 signatures to force a floor vote on a bill to release the files within 30 days.\n\nThere’s still a long road ahead.\n\nRepublican leaders aligned with President Donald Trump’s wishes by stalling Democrat-backed legislation to release the files. Trump, a onetime  friend  of Epstein, has faced persistent questions about what the files may show about the two men’s history.\n\nBill sponsors Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna used an arcane procedural tactic called a discharge petition to secure floor consideration. The move came over the objections of Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders. Johnson has argued that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s ongoing effort is sufficient. The committee has released tranches of emails and other documents related to Epstein, most recently on November 12, a release that included  emails from Epstein  that discussed Trump.\n\nFor weeks, the discharge effort was stuck at 217 votes – one short of the required 218 – but supporters reached the magic number on November 12 when newly elected Representative Adelita Grijalva was sworn in 50 days after being elected, the longest delay in recent history.\n\nGrijalva signed the petition shortly after her swearing-in, making the discharge official. Massie and three other Republican members – Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina – joined all Democrats in signing it.\n\nThough Johnson could have delayed it further, he said he would bring the measure for a vote the week of November 17.\n\nTrump opposes further releases of Epstein material, writing on Truth Social November 12 that Republicans should focus only on opening up the government, which was still  shut down  because of a funding impasse. “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else,” his post said.\n\nHere’s a guide to what happens next with this legislation and what’s at stake.\n\nEpstein hobnobbed with powerful people and received lenient treatment by the criminal justice system until the Miami Herald published an extensive investigation into his case in 2018.\n\nIn 2005, Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein after reports that a 14-year-old girl had been molested at his mansion. A grand jury indicted Epstein in 2006 on a single count of prostitution and he was arrested. The FBI launched an investigation and was prepared to bring an indictment, but in 2008 Epstein pleaded to one state count of soliciting prostitution and one state count of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. He served about a year in jail, largely on work release.\n\nThe Miami Herald investigation found federal prosecutors and Epstein’s lawyers covered up the scope of Epstein’s crimes.\n\nIn July 2019, Epstein was arrested on  federal charges  for recruiting dozens of underage girls to his New York City mansion and Palm Beach estate from 2002 to 2005 to engage in sex acts for money. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, and investigators concluded he died by  suicide .\n\nThe Trump administration has given conflicting information about what’s in the Epstein files.\n\nIn February, Attorney General  Pam Bondi  released what she called the “first phase” of the declassified Epstein files, including flight logs, an evidence list and a redacted list of contacts. Bondi said the Justice Department would release more case files after redacting victims’ names.\n\nWhen Fox News host John Roberts  asked Bondi in February  whether her department would release a list of Epstein’s clients, she said, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.”\n\nBut in a July memo, the Justice Department said there was “no incriminating ‘client list’”.\n\n“There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” the memo said. “We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n\nThe Massie-Khanna bill, titled the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requires that no later than 30 days after the bill’s enactment, the attorney general shall release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” held by the Justice Department, the FBI and federal prosecutors’ offices relating to Epstein and his partner  Ghislaine Maxwell , who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls over the course of a decade.\n\nThese materials would include flight logs and travel records related to Epstein, documents related to people and companies connected to Epstein, prosecution documents and internal Justice Department communications about Epstein-related cases and material related to his death in custody.\n\nUnder the legislation, documents containing victims’ identifiable information may be withheld or redacted. So would materials depicting child sex abuse, death or injury, or materials that would jeopardise an ongoing federal investigation, or prosecution or that would endanger national security. However, “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity” cannot be invoked to withhold material, the legislation says.\n\nThe steepest hurdle in the House was securing the 218th signature.\n\nWith that achieved, Khanna said he expects dozens more Republicans to vote for the bill than the four who signed on to the discharge petition, The Hill reported.\n\nIf the legislation clears the House, it would head to the Senate. It would need 60 Senate votes to proceed to final consideration, meaning at least 13 Republicans would have to join all 47 Democrats and Democratic-aligned independents to advance. That’s a challenging obstacle.\n\n“It is treated the same as any other bill, solely subject to the discretion of the majority leadership,” Donald Wolfensberger, a former staff director of the House Rules Committee, said.\n\nIn July, reporters asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune whether any Senate Republicans supported forcing more Epstein file disclosure. He said he was “not hearing” much desire within his conference to push the issue.\n\nThune said that when the House petition was still gathering signatures, and a successful House vote – especially with strong Republican support – could change that Senate calculus. But even if the Senate were to pass the legislation, the measure would face its stiffest test with Trump, who could veto the bill.\n\nOverriding a presidential veto would require a two-thirds vote of both chambers, which would require substantial Republican support in opposition to their own party’s leader.\n\nIf the measure became law, Trump could still find ways to neuter its impact.\n\n“The implementation of its provisions would still rely on Justice Department compliance,” a department that Trump has asserted significant control over, said Stanley Brand, a longtime Washington DC attorney who serves as distinguished fellow at Penn State Dickinson Law.\n\nThe Justice Department could argue to withhold certain documents, and resolving legal challenges to those decisions could put document releases at a standstill, Brand said.\n\n“Complex questions of standing and federal court jurisdiction to entertain such a suit would undoubtedly stall resolution,” he said.\n\nDave Aronberg, a Democratic former state attorney of Palm Beach County, Florida, said he expects the Justice Department to have “wiggle room” with the exceptions included in the legislation.\n\nStill, he said, it would “take a lot of creativity to withhold documents relating to President Trump”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/14/live-ukraines-capital-kyiv-comes-under-deadly-russian-attack?update=4106334","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:37:26+00:00","title":"Russian attacks on Ukraine kill 6 in Kyiv, 2 in Chornomorsk","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian attacks on Ukraine have killed six civilians in the capital city of Kyiv and two in the coastal city of Chornomorsk, underscoring the ongoing human cost of the war and the expansion of military violence into key urban and regional centers across the country.","keyTakeAways":["Russian attacks on Ukraine resulted in at least 8 fatalities: 6 in Kyiv and 2 in Chornomorsk.","The attacks highlight the ongoing threat posed by Russian military actions to civilian populations in Ukraine.","The attacks demonstrate that the conflict is not limited to major urban centers but also affects smaller cities and coastal areas.","The incidents underscore the vulnerability of Ukrainian infrastructure and the human cost of the war."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Russia","whatIsThisEntity":"A country that launched attacks on Ukraine.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Russia is the aggressor in the conflict described, and its actions directly caused the casualties reported in the article."},{"name":"Ukraine","whatIsThisEntity":"A country that was attacked by Russia.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Ukraine is the target of Russian attacks, and the article details civilian casualties in Ukrainian cities, emphasizing the human toll of the war."},{"name":"Kyiv","whatIsThisEntity":"The capital city of Ukraine.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Kyiv is a major urban center attacked, showing that Russian military actions extend to the heart of Ukraine's political and administrative structure."},{"name":"Chornomorsk","whatIsThisEntity":"A city in eastern Ukraine, located on the Black Sea coast.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Chornomorsk is a secondary location affected by attacks, indicating that the conflict reaches beyond capital cities to include coastal regions with strategic or civilian significance."}],"importantDates":[{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-11-14","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The date of the news report indicates the most recent occurrence of Russian attacks on Ukraine, highlighting the ongoing nature of the conflict."}],"importantTimeframes":[{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2025","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The attacks occurred in 2025, placing them within the current year and showing the continuing escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine."}],"tags":["Russia-Ukraine conflict","military attacks","civilian casualties","Kyiv","Chornomorsk","war in Ukraine"],"content":"Published: 2025-11-14T06:37:26+00:00\n\nTitle: Russian attacks on Ukraine kill 6 in Kyiv, 2 in Chornomorsk\n\nBy  Fiona Kelliher  and  Umut Uras\n\nShare\n\nSave"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has released a report warning that the global expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure—now affecting at least 2 billion people and with over 3,500 new sites under development—is endangering billions of lives, worsening climate change, and violating human rights, particularly against Indigenous communities and environmental activists.

obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/14/live-ukraines-capital-kyiv-comes-under-deadly-russian-attack?update=4106392","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:37:26+00:00","title":"Russian attacks on Ukraine kill 6 in Kyiv, 2 in Chornomorsk","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian attacks on Ukraine have killed six people in Kyiv and two in Chornomorsk, highlighting the ongoing military conflict and its devastating impact on civilian populations.

Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii claims Russia has deployed up to 150,000 troops to these areas, with a significant portion engaged in active combat. Despite these advances, Ukrainian forces maintain a defensive posture using drones for search-and-strike operations, having targeted over 77,000 targets in October alone. These drone attacks have disrupted key Russian infrastructure, including the Lukoil Volgograd refinery, Belgorod substations, Tuapse port, and power plants in Voronezh and Saratov.

into Ukraine’s eastern towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad during the past week as Kyiv’s military mounted a stout defence.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii said almost half of the battles on a 1,200km (745-mile) front were happening in the two towns, claiming Russia has  committed  150,000 troops – almost a quarter of its strength in Ukraine – to capturing them.\n\nRussia sees  Pokrovsk  as a gateway to the remaining unoccupied parts of Donetsk, the region it has already claimed as its own in September 2022.\n\nAs Ukrainians were gripped by a  corruption scandal  involving President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s allies, the battlefront was in a fluid state in which no side seemed to gain a decisive advantage.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine often captured and recaptured neighbourhoods and individual buildings from each other.\n\nHus, a drone squad commander from the 68th Jaeger brigade on the outskirts of Pokrovsk, told the Reuters news agency, “Here, one building is held by our side, the next occupied by the enemy, and in a few hours it swaps.”\n\nIt did appear, however, that the Russians were slowly gaining ground.\n\nUkrainian troops told  Reuters  the defence of Pokrovsk was “steadily deteriorating”, despite the army’s efforts to reinforce it.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defence said its troops were advancing through Pokrovsk in house-to-house battles.\n\nA Ukrainian unit commander said Russia was leading its assault with Spetsnaz special forces who were looking for Ukrainian mortar firing crews and drone units, aiming to neutralise them and ease the passage of reinforcements.\n\nThese tactics had enabled the Russians to capture the centre of Pokrovsk by early November, and in the past week, they were attempting to work their way east and west. Ukrainian defenders appeared to be maintaining a stronghold in the north of Pokrovsk.\n\nIn Myrnohrad, to the east of Pokrovsk, Russian troops were infiltrating the eastern reaches of the town, and this week made a marginal advance into its northern edge, while Ukrainian defenders firmly held the bulk of it.\n\nBoth towns are precariously situated in a Russian encirclement from the north, south and east, in which supply and escape routes are only available towards the west.\n\nThe operational significance of the towns’ seizure by Russia depended on “whether Ukrainian forces conduct an orderly withdrawal or disorderly retreat” and on “Russian forces’ ability to exploit the collapse of the pocket and conduct a successful pursuit”, wrote the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nRussia’s Defence Ministry has repeatedly claimed that the towns’ complete envelopment and surrender with forces still inside was imminent.\n\nYet Ukraine has defied Russian expectations and fought on, engaging in what Syrskii called an “active defence”, using drones for “search and strike operations” that took a toll.\n\n“Every metre of our land costs Russia hundreds of military lives,” Syrskii wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.\n\nIn October alone, Syrskii said, short-range drones had struck 77,000 targets, a 16 percent increase on the 66,500 targets he said had been struck in September, which in turn represented an 11 percent increase on August.\n\nThese figures suggested that Russian infiltrators’ efforts in smoking out drone units and cutting off Ukrainian resupply were meeting with less success than the Russian command might have hoped.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, Russia also stiffened its offensive near Huliaipole, about 60km (37 miles) southwest of Pokrovsk, on the border of the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions.\n\nSyrskii said the situation had “significantly worsened” there, and that “exhausting battles” were taking place for Rivnopillia and Yablukove. Geolocated footage showed Ukraine was forced to abandon Rivnopillia on Tuesday.\n\nOn Saturday, Axios reported that the United States government shutdown may have delayed delivery of $5bn of weapons systems to NATO allies and Ukraine, though it did not draw a direct connection between this and the defence of Pokrovsk.\n\nRussia kept up pressure on other parts of the front.\n\nIts Defence Ministry claimed to have seized Uspenovka, Novoye and Sladkoye in  Zaporizhia , Volchye in Dnipropetrovsk, and Gnatovke in Donetsk.\n\nFar from the ground war, Ukraine continued to pummel Russian refineries in a bid to cut off its fuel supply to the front.\n\nLukoil’s Volgograd refinery stopped operations on November 6 after being hit by Ukrainian drones, according to unnamed sources who spoke to Reuters. They said that the primary processing unit, representing a fifth of the plant’s total capability and other equipment was damaged.\n\nOn Saturday, Ukraine struck substations near Belgorod, causing a blackout in the city.\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine caused a fire at the port and oil terminal of Tuapse, on the Black Sea. Russia said it destroyed four Ukrainian surface drones heading for the Tuapse oil terminal, which Ukraine has struck repeatedly in recent weeks, but others must have got through.\n\nUkraine also struck a power plant in Voronezh.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Saratov refinery caught fire after being attacked by drones. Explosions were also heard coming from the nearby refinery in Orsk.\n\n“Russia has an air defence deficit, with losses including S-300, S-400, and many Pantsir [air defence] systems that protected facilities,” wrote the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko.\n\n“Most of the enemy’s air defence is near the front and Moscow, creating significant gaps in Russia’s airspace. To understand, most Russians in the country are not protected by [President Vladimir] Putin at all, although he constantly promised security to everyone.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known as Super Typhoon Uwan in the Philippines, devastated northern regions of the country, killing at least 10 people and displacing over 1.4 million.

The trial’s opening session, initially scheduled for October 16, has been adjourned to November 24.\n\nIt is a long way from the  heady days of the Arab Spring in 2011 , when Tunisia appeared to be the only country to emerge relatively unscathed in the initial years that followed with a bona fide democracy in full flow.\n\nA sweeping power grab in July 2021, when he dissolved parliament and expanded executive power so he could rule by decree, saw Saied jail many of his critics. That decree was later enshrined in a new constitution – ratified by a widely boycotted 2022 referendum – while media figures and lawyers critical of Saied have also been prosecuted and detained under a harsh  “fake news” law  enacted the same year.\n\nWithin the past four months, Tunisia has temporarily suspended the activities of at least 14 Tunisian and international NGOs, said Amnesty, including the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women and the World Organisation against Torture.\n\nIndividuals have been similarly targeted.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said in a statement on Friday that Tunis’s Court of Appeal will hear on November 17 the appeal of more than 30 people “unjustly sentenced to heavy prison terms in a politically motivated ‘Conspiracy Case'” mass trial in April.\n\n“Four of those detained are on hunger strike, including one who, according to his lawyers, was subjected to physical violence in prison on November 11.”\n\nThe defendants were charged with plotting to destabilise the country under various articles of Tunisia’s Penal Code and the 2015 Counterterrorism Law. Human Rights Watch, which reviewed the judicial documents, said the charges are unfounded and lack credible evidence. The NGO has called on the court to immediately overturn the convictions and ensure the release of all those detained.\n\n“This entire case has been a masquerade, from the baseless accusations to a judicial process devoid of fair trial guarantees,” said Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should end this judicial farce, which is part of a wider crackdown on any form of criticism or dissent.”\n\nThe 37 people detained include opponents of Saied, lawyers, activists and researchers. Their prison terms range from four to 66 years for “conspiracy against state security” and terrorism offences.\n\nJawhar Ben Mbarek – cofounder of Tunisia’s main opposition alliance, the National Salvation Front – began a hunger strike on October 29 to protest his arbitrary detention.\n\nBen Mbarek was sentenced to 18 years behind bars on charges of “conspiracy against state security” and “belonging to a terrorist group”.\n\nThe leaders of Tunisia’s major opposition parties have  gone on hunger strikes  in solidarity with Ben Mbarek.\n\nAmong them is Issam Chebbi, leader of the centrist Republican Party, who is also being detained after being convicted in the April mass trial.\n\nRached Ghannouchi, the 84-year-old leader of the Ennahdha party, who is also serving a hefty prison sentence, announced he was joining the hunger protest.\n\nGhannouchi was convicted in July of “conspiring against state security”, adding to previous convictions, including money laundering, for which he has been sentenced to more than 20 years in prison and for which he claims innocence.\n\n“Tunisia’s international partners should speak up against this flagrant injustice and assault on the rule of law,” Khawaja said. “They should urge Tunisian authorities to cease their crackdown, overturn these convictions, and guarantee fair trials.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-12-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-12:59","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of critical science and technology developments, including a G4 geomagnetic storm watch from the U.S. weather agency, Amazon's recent layoffs, misleading public health claims by former President Trump, Delhi’s attempt to combat pollution through cloud seeding, Nvidia’s global expansion amid trade tensions, a major capital deal enabling OpenAI’s growth to a $500 billion valuation, promising mRNA-based cancer vaccines, and the UK’s rise as a global AI hub due to U.S. tech investments.

with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is enforcing a ban on children under 16 from accessing major social media platforms, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, effective December 10, 2025.

under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, after its discovery by the ATLAS telescope team in July 2025.

deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c874nw4g2zzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:57:43.662Z","title":"BBC apologises to Trump over Panorama edit but refuses to pay compensation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC apologised to US President Donald Trump for a misleading edit in a 2021 Panorama programme that spliced parts of his speech, creating a false impression of a direct call for violent action.

apologises to Trump over Panorama edit but refuses to pay compensation\n\nThe BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced parts of his 6 January 2021 speech together, but rejected his demands for compensation.\n\nThe corporation said the edit had given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not show the 2024 programme again.\n\nLawyers for Trump have threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him.\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast she was confident the corporation was \"gripping this with the seriousness that it demands\", adding her role was to ensure \"the highest standards are upheld\".\n\nBut she also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the BBC's editorial standards and guidelines were \"in some cases not robust enough and in other cases not consistently applied\", adding that there would need to be people \"at a very senior level with a journalistic background\".\n\nPolitical appointments to the corporation's board would be examined in the BBC's charter review, she said in response to a question asking if member Sir Robbie Gibb, a former political adviser to Theresa May, had overstepped his remit and weighed into politics.\n\nWhile this was a matter for the board and its chairman, she said, those appointments \"damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality\".\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey had urged the prime minister on Thursday to \"get on the phone to Trump\" to put a stop to his lawsuit threat and \"defend the impartiality and independence of the BBC\".\n\nThe fallout from the scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness on Sunday.\n\nBBC News has approached the White House for comment.\n\nThe apology comes hours after  a second similarly edited clip , broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by  the Daily Telegraph .\n\nIn its Corrections and Clarifications section , published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\n\nThe BBC had been given a deadline of 22:00 GMT (17:00 EST) on Friday to respond.\n\n\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.\n\nLawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday, a BBC spokesperson said.\n\n\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.\n\nThey added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nIn Trump's speech he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nMore than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nIn the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Trump said his speech had been \"butchered\" and the way it was presented had \"defrauded\" viewers.\n\nThe BBC received the letter from Trump's lawyers on Sunday. It demands a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary, an apology, and that the BBC \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused\".\n\nIn its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC sets out five main arguments for why it does not think it has a case to answer.\n\nFirst it says the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.\n\nWhen the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.\n\nSecondly, it says the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.\n\nThirdly, it says the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.\n\nFourthly, it says the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained   lots of voices in support of Trump.\n\nFinally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.\n\nA BBC insider said that internally, there is a strong belief in the case the corporation has put forward, and in its defence.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the BBC was accused of another misleading edit of Trump's 6 January 2021 speech, two years before the Panorama sequence aired.\n\nOn a Newsnight programme from 2022, the edit is a little different from Panorama.\n\nTrump is shown as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.\"\n\nThis was followed by a voiceover from presenter Kirsty Wark saying \"and fight they did\" over footage from the Capitol riots.\n\nResponding to the clip on the same programme, former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who quit a diplomatic post and became a critic of Trump after describing the 6 January riots as an \"attempted coup\", said the video had \"spliced together\" Trump's speech.\n\n\"That line about 'we fight and fight like hell' is actually later in the speech and yet your video makes it look like those two things came together,\" he said.\n\nIn response to Thursday's story in the Telegraph, a BBC spokesperson said the BBC holds itself to the \"highest editorial standards\" and the matter was being looked into.\n\nA spokesman for Trump's legal team told the Telegraph it was \"now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump\".\n\nConcerns over the Trump Panorama documentary emerged when  a leaked internal memo , written by a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee, was  published by the Telegraph newspaper .   Among other things, the document also criticised the BBC's reporting of trans issues, and BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/us-pushes-security-council-to-back-gaza-plan-as-russia-offers-counter-text","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:52:25+00:00","title":"US pushes Security Council to back Gaza plan as Russia offers counter text","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is urging the UN Security Council to adopt a draft resolution supporting President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan, which proposes a two-year transitional governance body known as the 'Board of Peace' chaired by Trump and a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to decommission weapons, protect civilians, and secure humanitarian access.

United States has called on the United Nations Security Council to officially back its draft resolution aimed at bolstering President Donald Trump’s  Gaza peace plan , warning that Palestinians could suffer “grave consequences” if it does not.\n\nThe call came as Russia presented the council with its own “counter-proposal” on Gaza, challenging Washington’s draft, according to a copy seen by the Reuters news agency.\n\nA spokesperson for the US mission to the UN said in a Thursday statement that “attempts to sow discord” around Washington’s resolution would only result in “grave, tangible, and entirely avoidable consequences” for Palestinians in Gaza should the ceasefire break down and Israel resume its assault.\n\nThe US mission formally circulated its draft resolution to the 15 UNSC members last week for negotiations on the wording and substance of the text.\n\nAccording to a draft of the text seen by the AFP news agency, it would authorise a two-year mandate running until the end of 2027 for a transitional governance body in Gaza – known as the “Board of Peace” – that Trump would chair.\n\nIt would also authorise member states to form a “temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF)” that would work on the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups” in Gaza, protect civilians and secure humanitarian aid corridors.\n\nThe ISF would also work with Israel, Egypt, and newly trained Palestinian police to help secure border areas and demilitarise the enclave.\n\nTrump has ruled out sending US troops into Gaza as part of the proposed 20,000-strong force.\n\nWashington says discussions have been held with Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan about contributing to the force, but reservations remain about sending soldiers due to fears they could come into direct conflict with Hamas.\n\nUnlike previous drafts, the latest iteration also references a possible future Palestinian state, saying “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority (PA) has carried out the requested reforms.\n\n“The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” the resolution adds.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday he was optimistic the resolution would be adopted, saying “good progress” was being made on negotiations around its language.\n\nBut despite broad support for a “Board of Peace” among UNSC members, serious questions remain regarding the lack of any mention in the text of any oversight mechanism for the body, the PA’s future role, or concrete details about the ISF’s mandate, AFP reports.\n\nWith these significant question marks still hanging over the US proposal, Russia presented its own counter-resolution to the UNSC on Thursday.\n\n“The objective of our draft is to enable the Security Council to develop a balanced, acceptable, and unified approach toward achieving a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the note said.\n\nOn October 8, Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of his much-touted  20-point peace plan  for Gaza, pausing the two-year conflict which has seen Israeli forces kill at least 69,179 people in the enclave.\n\nThe deal has also facilitated the exchange of Israeli captives held in the enclave – alive and deceased – for Palestinian prisoners, as well as the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops and the entry of some humanitarian aid.\n\nWhile the ceasefire remains in place, Israel has repeatedly  violated the agreement  with near-daily attacks that have killed hundreds of Palestinians.\n\nPointing to this “fragile” ceasefire in its Thursday note to the UNSC, the US mission urged the body to “unite and move forward to secure the peace that is desperately needed” by backing Washington’s resolution.\n\n“[It’s a] historic moment to pave a path towards enduring peace in the Middle East,” it said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e319e6gzno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:13:32.830+00:00","title":"Oklahoma spares death row inmate hours before

execution\n\nOklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has granted clemency to a death row prisoner, commuting his sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe clemency notice came just before Tremane Wood, 46, was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on Thursday.\n\nWood was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 2004 for his role  in the fatal stabbing of farmworker Ronnie Wipf during a robbery. The victim's family told a parole board they opposed Wood's execution.\n\nWithin hours of being spared from execution, Wood was found unresponsive in his cell and was taken to hospital, officials say. He later reported that he was feeling fine again.\n\nThe officials said they had determined that the incident happened due to dehydration and stress. Wood was quoted saying he had not eaten or drank anything since Wednesday evening, when he had what was then believed to be his last meal.\n\nAnnouncing the clemency, Stitt said: \"After a thorough review of the facts and prayerful consideration, I have chosen to accept the Pardon and Parole Board's recommendation to commute Tremane Wood's sentence to life without parole.\"\n\nThis is the second time Stitt has granted clemency to a prisoner on death row since becoming governor in 2019.\n\nWood's lawyers accepted he was part of the botched robbery on New Year's Eve in 2001 but denied that he stabbed Wipf at an Oklahoma City motel. His older brother Zjaiton Wood pleaded guilty to the murder and died in prison in 2019.\n\n\"This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,\" Stitt added in a statement.\n\nWood's attorney Amanda Bass Castro-Alves welcomed the clemency decision.\n\n\"We are profoundly grateful for the moral courage and leadership Governor Stitt has shown in granting mercy to Tremane,\" Ms Castro-Alves said to the BBC. \"This decision honours the wishes of Mr. Wipf's family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace.\"\n\nThey argue that Wood's trial was unfair and accuse his attorney at the time John Barry Albert of providing ineffective defence because he was addicted to drugs and alcohol during the trial. In 2006, Oklahoma's Supreme Court briefly suspended Albert's law licence for drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nEarlier this month, the state's parole board vote 3-2 to recommend clemency instead of the execution. Wipf's family and his friend Arnold Kleinsasser, who survived the robbery, agreed with the recommendation. Governor Stitt praised their willingness to forgive.\n\n\"I pray for the family of Ronnie Wipf and for the surviving victim, Arnie; they are models of Christian forgiveness and love,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond expressed disappointment in Stitt's clemency notice.\n\n\"My office will continue working to ensure that Tremane Wood remains behind bars and that the public is protected from him,\" he said, according to local station KSWO.\n\nOklahoma has carried out two executions so far this year, according to a tracker by the Death Penalty Information Center.

plan to boost troop numbers\n\nGermany's coalition government has agreed a new military service plan to boost troop numbers following months of wrangling between political forces.\n\nThe new military service plan will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their suitability to serve and, from 2027, to undergo medical screening.\n\nThe decision comes as Berlin aims to create Europe's strongest conventional army.\n\nThe boss of Germany's biggest defence firm, Rheinmetall, has told the BBC he believes that target could be met in five years.\n\nLawmakers are expected to vote on the plan by the end of 2025.\n\nArmin Papperger said Chancellor Friedrich Merz's aim to boost the Bundeswehr was \"realistic\" and he told the BBC that \"clear decisions\" were coming from government.\n\nEarlier this year German defence chief Gen Carsten Breuer warned that the Western Nato alliance had to prepare for a possible Russian attack within four years.\n\nMr Papperger said he had \"no glass ball\" about the future but agreed Germany had to be \"ready in '29\".\n\nWhen they formed a coalition earlier this year, Merz's conservative CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrat SPD agreed to re-introduce military service which would be voluntary \"to start with\".\n\nThe Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 troops. The new military service model aims to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year, rising to between 255,000 and 260,000 over the next 10 years, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists.\n\nFrom next year, all 18-year-old men and women will be sent a questionnaire to assess their interest and willingness to join the armed forces. It will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.\n\nFrom July 2027 all men aged 18 will also have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for duty.\n\nIf the government's targets are not met, a form of compulsory enlistment could be considered by parliament. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.\n\nSome within Germany's political left remain deeply opposed to mandatory service.\n\nMany young Germans are wary and a significant majority oppose it. A recent Forsa survey for Stern magazine suggested while just over half of respondents favoured compulsory service, opposition rose to 63% among 18- to 29-year-olds.\n\n\"I don't want to go to war because I don't want to die or I don't want to be shot at,\" said Jimi, a 17-year-old student from Berlin, who attended an anti-conscription protest outside the Bundestag earlier this week. \"I also don't want to shoot people.\"\n\nAn attack against Germany was an \"unlikely and abstract scenario\" that the government was using to legitimise \"stealing millions of young people's right to decide what they should be doing\", he said.\n\nMeanwhile, 21-year-old Jason signed up as new Bundeswehr recruit earlier this year because of the current \"security situation\".\n\n\"I wanted to contribute to defend peace, to defend democracy if the worst happens,\" he said. By joining up he felt he was \"giving back to society\" but also believed in the deterrent potential of the army, \"so potential enemies don't even think about attacking you\".\n\nDefence Minister Boris Pistorius has sought to reassure Germans, saying that despite the new military service plan there was \"no cause for concern... no reason for fear\".\n\n\"The more capable of deterrence and defence our armed forces are, through armament through training and through personnel, the less likely it is that we will become a party to a conflict at all,\" Pistorius said.\n\nDefence spending in Germany tumbled after the end of the Cold War, while conscription was suspended in 2011.\n\nGiven its past, Germany has long been shy of showing military might, but earlier this year Friedrich Merz announced that the rule for German defence \"now has to be whatever it takes\", following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNato countries across Europe have come under pressure from President Donald Trump's White House to hike spending.\n\nEuropean moves to re-arm have meant significant revenue for Rheinmetall.\n\nIts CEO, Armin Papperger, whose firm also supplies Ukraine, said: \"We make a lot of money because there is a huge demand.\"\n\n\"We have to grow strong on vehicles, on ammunition, we have to have our own satellite competencies. We do much more on the electronics and artificial intelligence... than ever before,\" he said.\n\nA US report last year suggested the Rheinmetall boss had been the target of a Russian assassination plot. There was no confirmation at the time and Mr Papperger would not be drawn on the report, saying: \"I feel good, I feel safe.\"\n\nAsked about whether he felt Europe was in a state of a cold or hybrid war, he said: \"Whatever you call it, it's not a peaceful time.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s directive to restart US nuclear weapon testing, which was initially interpreted as a call for explosive detonations. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarifies that the tests are noncritical and will not involve nuclear explosions; instead, they will involve testing of weapon components and systems in laboratories or through advanced simulations. Experts from Chatham House and the Arms Control Association emphasize that such non-explosive, 'subcritical' tests are scientifically valid and consistent with existing safety protocols. The US has maintained a 30-year nuclear testing moratorium since 1992 and asserts its stockpile remains safe without testing. Trump's claims about China's rapid nuclear expansion and global testing by other powers are challenged by experts, who note no credible evidence of such activity.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxk3w9277o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"01:21:48.544+00:00","title":"I could hardly walk - the issue that affects 1 in 5 mums","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pelvic girdle pain (PGP), a common condition affecting one in five pregnant women, causes severe pain and mobility issues that can lead to disability, including the need for wheelchairs or crutches.

she had no idea that she would end up in a wheelchair for the final three months before she gave birth.\n\nRebecca had had a difficult first trimester dealing with nausea and sickness, and began to develop pelvic pain four months into her pregnancy.\n\n\"I could hardly walk, I'd always had some problems with lower back pain in my life. But nothing that significant and it escalated quite quickly,\" she says.\n\nAfter complaining about the pain, she was referred to an NHS physio, and eventually diagnosed with an extreme case of pelvic girdle pain (PGP), also known as symphysis pubic dysfunction.\n\nProblems with your pelvic joints are a common symptom of pregnancy, affecting one in five expectant mothers to some degree.\n\n\"I was terrified, would I ever walk again? How would I have my baby, how would I care for it?\"\n\nAfter giving birth, Rebecca was in less pain, but she still struggled with basic things like walking, lifting her son or pushing a pram.\n\n\"I was disabled for seven months and had to have someone helping me all the time,\" she says.\n\n\"I just couldn't do the things that you should be able to do in looking after a baby, it was a really challenging time.\"\n\nPrior to becoming pregnant, it was an issue Rebecca was unaware of and since her experience she volunteers for The Pelvic Partnership, a charity which helps raise awareness and support women with this condition.\n\nIt says the condition is treatable with the right action.\n\nAs soon as your symptoms start, the charity advises you get hands-on individualised treatment, including manual therapy, and ask for a referral for NHS physiotherapy from your GP or midwife.\n\nIf you aren't offered this support initially, the charity suggests going back to your GP or midwife and asking for a second opinion.\n\nThey can also refer you to maternal mental health support to help you manage the emotional impacts of living with PGP.\n\nDr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says higher awareness and early assessment could prevent patients like Rebecca needing wheelchairs or crutches.\n\n\"Without that early identification based on a really good understanding of the female body, we leave some of these women with negative effects for life,\" she says.\n\nVictoria Roberton, co-ordinator at the Pelvic Partnership, is an example of how awareness can help.\n\nLike Rebecca, she didn't know what PGP was when she began experiencing the condition during her first pregnancy.\n\nShe tried to stay as active as possible as advised and was referred to NHS physio sessions online and by phone, but found the pain worsening as her pregnancy progressed.\n\n\"They gave us exercises, stretches to do. By this point I couldn't do any of them. It was too painful,\" she says.\n\nIt got to the point where even sitting became uncomfortable for Victoria, and she was largely homebound until her baby was born.\n\nThe pain lessened after the birth of her daughter, but she began experiencing the same problem when she became pregnant with her second child.\n\nIt's not an option for many mothers, but Victoria said given her medical history she decided to pay for a private physio as the NHS wait for referral was long.\n\nThe physio gave her a full assessment and hands-on treatment including joint mobilisation, and taught her different ways to move her body to not aggravate her hip joints, which helped ease the pain.\n\nVictoria still struggles with a degree of PGP today, four years on, but her second pregnancy was much easier to manage because she understood her condition and how to handle it.\n\nRebecca's second pregnancy has been similarly a much more positive experience.\n\nThis time round she knew she was at risk of PGP and was able to have it treated throughout her pregnancy before it became debilitating.\n\nShe has made a full recovery from PGP, just two months post birth compared to  two years for her first child.\n\n\"I'm probably in better shape now than I was before either of my children because I now know what caused that pelvic girdle pain, and have had it fully treated and resolved with manual therapy,\" she says.\n\n\"It was five years of hell because of the pain I was in because of a lack of knowledge and understanding about the subject.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77zgmg6d76o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:58:23.307+00:00","title":"New photo for King Charles's 77th birthday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new photograph of King Charles celebrating his 77th birthday has been released by Buckingham Palace, showing him at Sandringham holding a shepherd's crook.

once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games.\n\nBut those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada.\n\n\"There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,\" Ms Gammon said.\n\nMs Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nOctober marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office.\n\nOverall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry.\n\nAs relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.\n\nIn the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.\n\nThey began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US.\n\nCanada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.\n\nTrade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario.\n\nMeanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the \"51st state\".\n\nSome popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US.\n\nIn Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a \"Canadian Welcome Pass\" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border.\n\n\"For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,\" the website for the welcome pass says.\n\nMajor events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.\n\nStill, with Canadians choosing to travel closer to home, the country's own tourism industry has gotten a boost. Canada's tourism sector made a record-breaking C$59bn from May to August of 2025, up 6% from the same period last year, mostly because of people choosing to travel domestically, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.\n\nSome of those choosing to stay home are Canadian snowbirds, retirees who travel south to states like Florida to find warmth in the winter months. A survey from the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada found these baby boomers were staying home more than other age groups, with only 10% planning US trips for this year, down 66% compared to last year.\n\nMs Gammon said some of her friends have even chosen to sell their winter homes in Florida because of the frosty relations and frustrations with the Trump administration.\n\n\"They've completely changed their snowbird plans,\" the semi-retired family physician said. \"You can feel there's a shift.\"\n\nMs Gammon said she did not know if others would stick to boycotting the US for the remaining three years of the Trump administration. But, even though she misses her US trips, that is her plan for now.\n\n\"Who knows what could change between now and three years,\" Ms Gammon said. \"But it would have to be pretty significant changes for us personally to change our minds.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r07dg6kro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"01:53:13.059+00:00","title":"What do we know about the Jeffrey Epstein files?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing public and political push for transparency has led to the release of thousands of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities, including emails, flight logs, and court records.

Trump administration for months as it grapples with a growing crisis over the sex crimes of late convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nPressure has been building from President Donald Trump's own supporters and from voices within his own Republican Party for more transparency on what the investigations into Epstein uncovered.\n\nOn Wednesday, thousands of documents belonging to the Epstein estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, mostly emails.\n\nHours later, the House of Representatives announced there would be a vote next week on a much wider release of Epstein material, the so-called Epstein files, belonging to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe announcement was forced by a discharge petition getting its critical 218th signature that triggers action on the floor.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein reached a plea deal with prosecutors after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home.\n\nPhotos of girls were found throughout the house, and he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender and escaped a heavy jail sentence as a result of the deal.\n\nEleven years later, he was charged with running a network of underage girls for sex. He died in prison while awaiting trial, and his death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThese two criminal investigations amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids of his various properties.\n\nThere was also a separate investigation into his British co-conspirator and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex.\n\nBoth Epstein and Maxwell were also the subject of civil cases.\n\nAt various stages over the years, some materials have been put into the public domain.\n\nWednesday's email dump was not the first tranche released by the House Oversight Committee since it subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.\n\nAn earlier release in September included a birthday book containing a note to Epstein bearing Trump's name but he has denied writing it.\n\nIn February this year, weeks after Trump took office, the Department of Justice and the FBI released what they described at the time as the \"first phase of the declassified Epstein files\".\n\nA group of right-wing influencers were invited to the White House but they were left disappointed when they realised that the 341 pages handed to them were mostly material that was already out there.\n\nIt included flight logs from Epstein's plane and a redacted version of his contacts book containing the names of famous people he knew.\n\nIn July, the Department of Justice and FBI said in a memo that no more material would be released.\n\nThe president's name is mentioned several times in the latest released emails belonging to the Epstein estate. He has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, were named in flight logs released in September.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has previously strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Musk has been quoted as saying that Epstein had invited him to the island but he had declined.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Trump is also named in unreleased FBI documents about Epstein and was told as much by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May. The paper noted that being named in the files was not evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nA White House spokesman called the story \"fake\", although an unnamed official speaking to Reuters said the administration did not dispute that Trump's name was included.\n\nAlthough the contents of any unreleased documents remain unknown, the existing materials in the public domain mention a number of high-profile figures who were connected to Epstein.\n\nAgain, this does not imply any wrongdoing by those individuals.\n\nDozens of names were mentioned in a release of court documents in 2024. Mountbatten-Windsor, former US President Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson were among the associates, friends and alleged victims named in the 900 pages that were unsealed.\n\nBoth the former US president and the British royal deny any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. Jackson died in 2009.\n\nThe release of documents related to the case of Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison for child sex trafficking.\n\nThe vote in the House of Representatives could happen as early as next week, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nFour Republicans and all 214 Democrats in the House signed the petition.\n\nIf the bill passes the House, it will move on to the Senate. Republican senators haven't said much yet on where they stand and it requires 60 votes to pass the upper chamber - a high threshold.\n\nThen it goes to the president's desk where it would probably be vetoed.\n\nTrump and Epstein appear to have been friends for a number of years, keeping a similar social circle.\n\nPreviously released files show that Trump's details were in Epstein's so-called black book of contacts. Flight logs also showed Trump flying on Epstein's plane on several occasions.\n\nThey were pictured together at elite events in the 1990s, and photos published by CNN purport to show Epstein in attendance at Trump's wedding to then-wife Marla Maples.\n\nIn 2002, Trump described Epstein as a \"terrific guy\". Epstein would later remark: \"I was Donald's closest friend for 10 years.\"\n\nAccording to Trump, they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. By 2008, Trump was saying that he had not been \"a fan of his\".\n\nThe White House has suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that \"the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep\".\n\nThe Washington Post, meanwhile, has suggested that the breakdown in their relationship was due to their rivalry over some real estate in Florida.\n\nDie-hard members of Trump's MAGA movement have long believed officials are hiding key truths about Epstein's life and death.\n\nSome of them have theorised that a child-molesting cabal has been operating at the highest levels of US society, protected by the state. The theory spread through cryptic messages posted by a pseudonymous character called Q.\n\nIn one of the conspiracy theories pushed by some MAGA influencers, Epstein was an agent of the Israeli government.\n\nSome Trump allies have tried to quell the backlash. Last month, Republican House announced an early recess for the chamber, stalling efforts to force the release of Epstein-related documents within 30 days.\n\nThere are several unanswered questions about Epstein shared by the wider population too - particularly why he was given such a lenient sentence in Florida, whether he and Maxwell were really acting alone and how he was allowed to take his own life in prison.\n\nTrump and his team hyped up the theories when they were running for office, but now that they are in power, they have found themselves unable to convince their supporter base that there are no more questions to answer."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd044me5dgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"02:42:51.048+00:00","title":"US senator John Fetterman jokes from hospital after fall","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Senator John Fetterman, a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania, was hospitalized after falling near his home in Braddock, Pittsburgh, due to a ventricular fibrillation flare-up that caused light-headedness.

observation in hospital after he fell and injured his face following an irregular heartbeat flare-up.\n\nFetterman, 56, was taken to hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his team said he is now \"doing well\" but remains under observation.\n\n\"If you thought my face looked bad before, wait until you see it now!\" the senator joked in a statement released by an office spokesperson.\n\nHealth issues afflicted Fetterman during his successful 2022 Pennsylvania Senate campaign, when he had a stroke and later spent six weeks in hospital seeking treatment for severe depression.\n\nA spokesperson for Fetterman said on social media that the 6-foot-8 senator fell near his home in Braddock, east Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Upon evaluation, it was established he had a ventricular fibrillation flare-up that led to Senator Fetterman feeling light-headed, falling to the ground and hitting his face with minor injuries.\n\n\"He is doing well and receiving routine observation at the hospital. He has opted to stay so doctors can fine-tune his medication regimen.\"\n\nVentricular fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm, according to US-based medical research group the Cleveland Clinic. It occurs when the heart's lower chambers beat quickly and randomly, preventing them from pumping blood normally to the rest of the body.\n\nCauses are usually linked to other heart conditions, electric shock, or electrolyte imbalances.\n\nFetterman's near-fatal stroke in May 2022 benched him from campaigning events, as he spent nine days in hospital following a three hour-long heart surgery.\n\nHe won the competitive seat later that year in the midterm elections, defeating Trump-endorsed celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz. Fetterman's victory handed the Democrats a wafer-thin Senate majority during the final two years of the Biden administration.\n\nIn 2023, he self-admitted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to receive treatment for clinical depression.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pennsylvania senator published his self-described \"candid memoir\" titled Unfettered, detailing his ongoing mental health struggles and the impact on his family.\n\n\"Depression is bipartisan,\" he told independent media co-founder Katie Couric in a podcast interview earlier this week.\n\n\"It doesn't check: 'Hey, are you a Republican? Are you rural? Are your urban? Are you liberal'. It happens to anybody.\"\n\nFetterman has developed a reputation on Capitol Hill as a hoodie-wearing, straight-talking centrist Democrat, who speaks out against his own party. He reflects in Unfettered on his congressional career as \"the consummate anti-politician\".\n\nHe was one of a handful of Senate Democrats who voted to end the longest US government shutdown earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven't been paid in weeks,\" he said.\n\nFetterman vocally opposed the shutdown, voting 15 times over the past month to reopen the government."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jn94gyllo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:02:54.736+00:00","title":"Russian drone slams into block of flats killing four in strikes across Kyiv","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of Russian drone and missile attacks targeted Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions in late November 2025, with a particularly deadly strike in the Lisovyi neighborhood resulting in the deaths of at least four people when a drone pierced a residential building and caused a structural collapse.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan.\n\nChina and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words this week, set off by Takaichi's suggestion that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan.\n\nBoth countries' foreign ministries have lodged serious protests with each other. A Chinese diplomat also made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi.\n\nThe spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about it:\n\nThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\n\n\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.\n\nA \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.\n\nTakaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".\n\nOn Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".\n\nWhile the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.\n\nTokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.\n\nXue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on.\n\nThen on Thursday, China's foreign ministry posted in Japanese and English on its X account, warning Japan to \"stop playing with fire\" and added that it would be an \"act of aggression\" if Japan \"dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation\".\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong also summoned the Japanese ambassador to China that same day to express their unhappiness.\n\nSun called Takaichi's remarks \"extremely wrong and dangerous\" and demanded that Japan withdraw the comments, according to state media Xinhua. He also warned that \"otherwise all consequences must be borne by Japan\".\n\nJapan's ambassador explained that their position on Taiwan \"has not changed\" and refuted Beijing's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"It is the consistent position of the Japanese government that we hope for a peaceful resolution of issues surrounding Taiwan through dialogue,\" he said during the daily news briefing.\n\nKihara also added that Japan \"strongly urged China to take appropriate action\" over Xue's social media comment.\n\nThere is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.\n\nThis was referenced in a statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday when it said that \"should Japan fail to draw lessons from history and dare to take reckless risks, even resorting to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait situation, it will inevitably suffer heavy losses and pay a bitter price in the face of the iron wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\".\n\nHistorical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe ,  suggests more tensions may lie ahead.\n\nThe conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.\n\nTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan.\n\nShe had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.\n\nChina is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.\n\nThis is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nFor decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.\n\nThe Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.\n\nOn the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nIn 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".\n\nIn this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\n\n\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\n\n\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zkrplpdyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:16:16.319+00:00","title":"Swiss deploy charm offensive in bid to slash crippling Trump tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Switzerland is actively engaging in diplomatic and business outreach to reduce President Donald Trump’s 39% tariff on Swiss exports, the highest in Europe.

However, a private business initiative last week may have made all the difference. Trump's response to the Swiss president's bid was that she \"was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen\".\n\nBut after last week's private business initiative Trump said a deal was being worked on to bring the tariffs \"a little bit lower… I haven't set any number\".\n\nFor Swiss industry, that deal could not come soon enough. Tech exports to the US are down 14.2% on the third quarter of last year,  according to latest statistics  - a dramatic fall since the tariff hike was imposed in August.\n\nSome figures in Swiss business, particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle.\n\nIn September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour.\n\nThe president, apparently guessing what was going on, even asked if Dufour would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland.\n\nLast week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS.\n\nIt is quite normal nowadays for any leader heading to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of Trump's German grandfather's birth certificate.\n\nRequests for confirmation of the gifts to the two Swiss companies involved brought a \"no comment\" from Rolex and MKS.\n\nBut days after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex \"Datejust\" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nA White House official confirmed the two items had been given to Trump.\n\nThe US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department.\n\nThey are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative.\n\nIn 1969, President Richard Nixon gently refused the gift of a Swiss Omega watch to commemorate the Moon landings.\n\nWhatever happens to the Swiss gifts, Trump's stance towards the Swiss appears to be softening, telling reporters he is working on something \"to help Switzerland\".\n\nSwiss economy minister Guy Parmelin and chief trade negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda, who travelled to Washington on Wednesday, are more hopeful than they have been in months, amid suggestions that 39% tariff may be reduced to 15% - the same as Switzerland's neighbours in the EU.\n\nIn return, promises from the Swiss pharmaceutical giants to build more production plants in the US are already on the table. It is also reported that Swiss International Airlines, whose fleet is primarily Airbus, may pivot towards Boeing.\n\nBut will it be enough? Swiss industry is waiting with bated breath. A number of Swiss companies have warned they will have to furlough staff if nothing changes.\n\nThe Swiss do have one more highly influential figure they can call on.\n\nFifa president and Swiss citizen Gianni Infantino, long a friend of Trump's, was reportedly urged by some Swiss parliamentarians to try to change the president's mind.\n\nAs part of preparations for next year's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico, Infantino visited the Oval Office in August bearing the trophy.\n\nAs the cameras rolled, he handed it to Trump saying he was \"a winner\". The president responded asking \"can I keep it? That's a beautiful piece of gold\".\n\nInfantino has also announced a brand new Fifa world peace prize, to be announced in Washington DC on 5 December.\n\nAll bets are off as to who that might be."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwlze7ex2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"01:59:21.335+00:00","title":"US justice department sues California after redistricting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has filed a federal lawsuit against California, alleging that the state’s newly approved congressional maps—resulting from Proposition 50—constitute racially gerrymandered districts that violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

Super Bowl\n\nPuerto Rican star Bad Bunny was the big winner at Thursday night's Latin Grammy Awards in Las Vegas, taking home five trophies.\n\nAmong them was album of the year, for the acclaimed Debí Tirar Más Fotos, a project which embraced his island's musical heritage - and paved the way for him to  perform at next year's Super Bowl half time show .\n\nDedicating the award to \"all the youth of Latin America\" he added: \"There are many ways of being patriotic and defending our homelands. We chose music.\"\n\nCharismatic Argentinian duo Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso also took home five prizes; with other winners including Alejandro Sanz, Gloria Estefan and Karol G - who is set to headline next year's Coachella festival.\n\nThe rapidly growing Latin music sector generated a record $1.4bn (£1.06bn) in 2024, making up 8.1% of total U.S. music revenue, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, which said it was shaping culture faster than any other genre.\n\nBad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, has been at the forefront of that movement. For three consecutive years between 2020 and 2022, he was the most-streamed artist in the world.\n\nDebí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos) is the 31-year-old's sixth album, and fuses live instrumentation with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaetón and traditional Puerto Rican styles like plena.\n\nAt the Latin Grammys, the title track earned him best urban song and best urban performance. He also picked up best reggaetón performance for Voy a llevarte pa PR, and best urban music album for Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\n\nHe is also nominated for six awards at the mainstream Grammys, which take place in February, including the three major categories of album, song and record of the year.\n\nThe star recently wrapped up a barnstorming concert residency in Puerto Rico; and is about to kick off his world tour in the Dominican Republic.\n\nHowever, he made headlines when he said the tour  would not include any dates on the US mainland  because he was concerned his fans might be targeted by  immigration raids.\n\nHis subsequent booking for next year's Super Bowl rankled some US conservatives.\n\nPresident Trump called the decision \"absolutely ridiculous\"  and that he had \"never heard\" of the star - who has 74 million monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\nThe Latin Grammy ceremony kicked off with a star-studded tribute to Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana, with Maluma, Edgar Barrera, Grupo Frontera and Christian Nodal playing a medley that began with his hit single Oye Como Va.\n\nKarol G and Marco Antonio Solís also took the stage for a sweet duet on Coleccionando Heridas; while Gloria Estefan played songs from her latest record Raíces, which went on to win best tropical album.\n\nBut Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso were judged to have the stand-out moment of the evening, with a colourful, off-the-wall medley of their hits El Impostor, #Tetas, La Que Puede, Puede and El Día Del Amigo.\n\nDressed in vivdly patterened Versace outfits, the duo played in front of four nearly naked, tattooed body builders, who carefully operated sewing machines at tiny, school-sized desks.\n\nAt the end of the performance, the duo threw dozens of heart-shaped pillows into the audience, all containing the phrase \"te amo\", supposedly stitched by their hunky counterparts.\n\nThey duo dominated the alternative music categories - winning best alternative album and best alternative song. They also picked up best short-form and best long-form video, and pop song of the year for El Día Del Amigo.\n\nSpeaking backstage, the childhood friends expressed their gratitude to each other.\n\n\"The most important thing here is that we've known each other since we were six years old,\" said Amoroso.\n\n\"All of this wasn't planned, it just happened. I want to tell Ca7riel that he's my friend, that I love him.\"\n\nCa7riel then surprised Paco with a  long and seemingly passionate kiss .\n\nElsewhere, Paloma Morphy, a 25-year-old Mexican, won best new artist after her debut album, Au, seduced listeners with its catchy melodies and vulnerable stories of heartbreak.\n\nColombian star Karol G won won song of the year for Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido, a lilting love song with a Merengue flavour, from her blockbuster fifth album Tropicoqueta.\n\nAnd Spanish superstar Alejandro Sanz picked up record of the year for his beautiful ballad Palmeras en el Jardín - unexpectedly beating Bad Bunny's smash hit Baile Inolvidable.\n\nAccepting the award, Sanz expressed his surprise, saying \"Benito, I stole it from you, forgive me.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4y4z169go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"00:07:36.936+00:00","title":"Will AI mean better adverts or 'creepy slop'?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"AI is transforming digital advertising by enabling hyper-personalization, where ads are tailored to individual users based on their online behavior, personality traits, and preferences.

you're scrolling through social media on your phone, and the ads start to look remarkably familiar. They're decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use.\n\nWelcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI.\n\nAdvertising company Cheil UK, for example, has been working with startup Spotlight on using large language AI models to understand people's online activity, and adapt that content based on what the AI interprets an individual's personality to be.\n\nThe technology can then mirror how someone talks in terms of tone, phrase and pace to change the text of an ad accordingly, and insert music and colours to match, say, whether the AI deems someone to be introverted or extroverted, or have specific preferences for loud or calm music, or light or dark colours.\n\nThe aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them.\n\nBrands in retail, consumer electronics, packaged goods, automotive, insurance and banking are already using the technology to create AI-enhanced, personality-driven ads to target online shoppers.\n\nThe AI is able to read what people post on public platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and other public forums - as well as someone's search history, and, most importantly, what people enter into ChatGPT.\n\nThen, with what it deduces about an individual's personality, the AI overlays that on top of what advertisers already know about people. For example, what part of the country you live in, what age bracket you're in, whether you have children or not, what your hobbies might be, where you go on holiday and what clothes you like to wear - information brands can already see through platforms like Facebook or Google.\n\nThat's why the jeans you've been searching online for magically appear in your inbox as a sponsored ad, or the holiday you've been searching for seems to follow you around the internet.\n\nThe difference is now AI can change the content of those ads, based on what it thinks your personality is, thanks to what it's been reading about you. It targets individual people, rather than the demographic segments or personas advertisers would traditionally use.\n\n\"The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level,\" says Cheil UK CEO Chris Camacho.\n\n\"You've now got AI systems that can go in and explore your entire digital footprint - your entire online persona, from your social media interests to what you've been engaging in.\n\n\"That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that's when you start to build a picture understanding that individual, so whether they're happy, whether they're sad, or what personal situation they're going through.\"\n\nAn added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output.\n\nResearchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes.\n\nThe study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn't mind that it had been written by AI.\n\n\"Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it's still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile,\" explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research.\n\n\"It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done],\" he adds.\n\nPersonalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising 'wastage' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go.\n\n\"Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they've already forgotten it,\" says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible.\n\n\"The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop.\"\n\nIvan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way.\n\n\"There's also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with,\" says London-based Mr Mato.\n\n\"AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn't whether brands can personalise everything - it's whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do.\"\n\nAI-personalised ads could also take a dark turn, Mr Camacho at Cheil UK acknowledges.\n\n\"There's going to be the camp that uses AI well and in an ethical manner, and then there's going to be those that use it to persuade, influence, and guide people down paths,\" he says.\n\n\"And that's the bit that I personally find quite scary. When you think about elections and political canvassing, and how the use of AI can influence voting decisions and who is going to be elected next.\n\nBut Mr Camacho is committed to staying on the right side of ethics.\n\n\"We don't have to use AI to make ads creepy or to influence individuals to do things that are unethical. We're trying to stay on the nicer side of it. We're trying to enhance the connection between brands and individuals, and that's all we've ever tried to do.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051q4pnz39o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:14:06.617+00:00","title":"Wicked: Man who grabbed Ariana Grande in Singapore charged in court","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 26-year-old Australian man, Johnson Wen, was charged with public nuisance after grabbing actress Ariana Grande during a Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore.

on Thursday said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.\n\nThe agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador come as US President Donald Trump faces scrutiny over his handling of the economy and concerns about affordability.\n\nAs part of an initial framework, a reciprocal tariff of 10% will stay on goods from Guatemala, Argentina and El Salvador, as will a 15% tax on imports from Ecuador into the US. But the deals will exempt products that cannot be produced in the US \"in sufficient quantities,\" such as coffee.\n\nThe US-Argentina deal also addresses beef producers' access to foreign markets.\n\nTrump previously downplayed concerns about cost of living, insisting the outlook had improved during his nine months in office. He said affordability was a \"new word\", and a \"con job\" by Democrats.\n\nBut he has  focused on the issue  with some urgency since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's off-year elections across a handful of states.\n\nThis week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to lower coffee prices, which have jumped about 20% in the US this year. Bessent also signalled relief on tariffs on bananas and other fruits.\n\nSenior administration officials on Thursday singled out coffee, cocoa and bananas as examples of imports from the four Latin American countries that are poised to escape tariffs.\n\nGuatemala and Ecuador are the biggest exporters of bananas to the US.\n\nWhile the US does import coffee from Central American countries including Guatemala, Brazil is the top coffee exporter to the US, according to data from the Agriculture Department, and is not covered by the deal.\n\nSevere weather is also contributing to high prices for coffee and cacao, senior administration officials said. But they added that prices will hopefully fall to some extent when tariffs ease, if retailers and wholesalers pass along savings to consumers.\n\nSeparately, in a joint statement announcing a framework deal with Argentina, the White House focused on expanding access to beef markets overseas.\n\nThe two countries \"have committed to improved, reciprocal, bilateral market access conditions for trade in beef\", according to the statement.\n\nThe soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he asked the Justice Department to  investigate meat-packing companies  over their possible role in driving up beef prices, after other recent proposals to lower prices  sparked backlash  among ranchers.\n\nThe four agreements with Latin American trading partners are expected to be signed within the next two weeks, senior administration officials said.\n\nThe deals stem from Trump's announcement in April of sweeping new tariffs on dozens of countries. Most were put on hold amid the resulting global financial panic.\n\nNations considered the \"worst offenders\" would face higher rates, as payback for what the Trump administration has called unfair trade policies. New tariff rates for dozens of countries were subsequently introduced in August, after delays to allow for trade talks.\n\nThe Trump administration has in recent weeks reached trade agreements with the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7j89ykro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:00:29.556+00:00","title":"Our dogs' diversity can be traced back to the Stone Age","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major scientific study reveals that the transformation of wolves into the diverse range of modern dog breeds began over 10,000 years ago during the Middle Stone Age, long before Victorian-era breeding practices.

Age\n\nIf you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable.\n\nBut a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought.\n\n\"When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,\" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study.\n\nShe and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago.\n\nIn a paper  published in the journal Science , this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution.\n\nThey created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives.\n\nThis revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads.\n\nDr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age.\n\n\"It's really surprising,\" she said. \"And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this.\"\n\nDogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle.\n\nThis study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food.\n\nTamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near.\n\nAs to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: \"It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see.\n\n\"It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one.\"\n\nFor tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In  another paper in this same edition of the journal Science , a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China.\n\nThey concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years.\n\nI can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxnerkx5pgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:59:14.846+00:00","title":"Israel confirms identity of hostage body returned by Hamas as Manny Godard","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has officially confirmed the identity of a body returned by Hamas as that of Meny Godard, a 73-year-old man killed during the October 7, 2023, attack on Kibbutz Be'eri.

mid-September, Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman who, his family said, had long plied the Caribbean in search of marlin and tuna, called his teenage daughter. He told her he was going fishing, she said, and would return in a few days.\n\nHe never made it back.\n\nThe day after he left, on Sept. 15, his family, fellow fishermen and Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, say Mr. Carranza was killed in a U.S. military strike on his boat. The furor about what happened to him  has ignited a feud over the huge U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and the legality of the deadly attacks on nearly 20 vessels since September.\n\nCaribbean Sea\n\nSanta Marta\n\nThe New York Times\n\n“I never thought I would lose my father in this way,” said Cheila Carranza, 14, this week, holding back tears as she gazed at a photo of him on her phone in her grandmother’s crowded home, where she lives in one room with her mother and two siblings.\n\nAs the death toll climbs from U.S. strikes on boats in waters near Latin America, tensions are increasing with Colombia, which had long been a top U.S. ally in the region. So far, 19 U.S. strikes have killed at least 76 people.\n\nThe attacks have enraged Mr. Petro, who accused the United States of murdering Mr. Carranza in one attack. President Trump responded by imposing sanctions on Mr. Petro and his family and moving to slash aid to the country. This week, Colombia suspended intelligence sharing with the United States until the Trump administration stops its strikes.\n\nThe Trump administration claims the attacks occurred on boats carrying illicit drugs that kill thousands of Americans. But many legal experts in the United States and elsewhere say the strikes violate international law because those killed, even if they had been suspected of committing any crimes, did not present an immediate threat.\n\nMangled bodies have begun washing up on the beaches of Trinidad and Tobago after U.S. strikes in the region. The only two known survivors of the strikes are not from Venezuela, but Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nThe Trump administration has called Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, the leader of a drug cartel and has privately said that the goal of the U.S. deployment, the largest in decades in Latin America, is to push the authoritarian leader from power.\n\nThe Trump administration has not provided evidence, aside from descriptions of intelligence assessments and declassified portions of video images, that any of the vessels it has destroyed were carrying drugs. At the same time, in Mr. Carranza’s case, there is no immediate ability to determine with certainty if he was simply a fisherman or had been involved in drug smuggling.\n\nMr. Petro, in a news conference last month, said Mr. Carranza was from a traditional fishing family, but “may have been involved very intermittently’’ with drugs.\n\nMany fishermen in coastal and island communities, he said, become involved in drug transport because poverty leaves them few alternatives.\n\nThe strikes have left Mr. Carranza’s family reeling and grasping for answers, offering a rare glimpse into the strain the U.S. deployment can inflict on those left behind as the toll from the deadly attacks continues to climb. The family has hired an American lawyer, who said he was preparing a legal claim.\n\nKaterine Hernández, the mother of three of Mr. Carranza’s children, disputed Mr. Trump’s claim that the strike that killed her former partner, along with two other people on the same boat, had targeted “confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela.”\n\n“Alejandro had nothing to do with Venezuela; he spent his entire life here in Colombia,” said Ms. Hernández, 37, in an interview in Santa Marta, a sun-drenched city on Colombia’s northern coast where she met Mr. Carranza when she was 13.\n\nMr. Carranza, 42, also occasionally took jobs piloting boats for others in the waters around Santa Marta, his family and other fishermen said, raising the possibility that the boat he was in was transporting something illicit with or without his knowledge.\n\nBut Ms. Hernández said that Mr. Carranza had never been involved in smuggling drugs. “If he was some kind of narcoterrorist,” she said, “then why are we living in misery instead of a mansion?”\n\nDespite separating several years ago, Ms. Hernández said, she and Mr. Carranza remained close. Until recently, she and the children had lived with his parents. While he rarely earned more than Colombia’s monthly minimum wage, about $382, she said, he always put food on the table for her and the children.\n\nNow, Ms. Hernández said, they were subsisting on the kindness of relatives who themselves have next to nothing. She and the three children are living in her mother’s home in Gaira, a gritty area of Santa Marta not far from the city’s glistening beaches.\n\nDan Kovalik, an American lawyer hired by Mr. Carranza’s family, said that even if Mr. Carranza had been suspected of piloting a boat carrying illicit drugs, it would have been illegal to kill him.\n\n“If the people on the boat were suspected of drug trafficking, they should have been arrested, not killed,” said Mr. Kovalik, who plans on filing suit in the United States and seeking damages for Mr. Carranza’s family.\n\nThe identities of the other two men aboard the boat remain unknown.\n\n“This case is important from two points of view,” Mr. Kovalik added. “First, the family deserves compensation for the loss.”\n\n“Second, we want this case to help stop these killings from taking place again,” Mr. Kovalik said. “This is murder, and it is destroying rule of law.”\n\nThe Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince Mr. Carranza departed on the fishing trip two months ago, Ms. Hernández said, their lives have been shattered.\n\nBefore the U.S. strike, she said, she had already been unable to work after a motorcycle accident severely damaged her right leg — near the place on her ankle where she still has Mr. Carranza’s first name, tattooed.\n\nThe school fees for Zaira, their 17-year-old daughter, have gone unpaid, she said, while their son, Libiston, 11, was traumatized after another child showed him the video shared by Mr. Trump, apparently showing the father’s boat being blown to pieces.\n\nMs. Hernández said that some people had questioned whether Mr. Carranza had even been killed at all since his body has not been recovered. Others have tried to insinuate that he was involved in drug smuggling, she said, because of a previous brush with the law.\n\nIn a case from 2012, Mr. Carranza had taken part in a scheme to steal weapons that had been confiscated in legal proceedings, according to Colombian officials. Ms. Hernández and Adenis Manjarres, 30, Mr. Carranza’s first cousin, both said that Mr. Carranza had never been jailed in connection to the case. Colombian officials did not have more information on the disposition of the case.\n\nLeonardo Vega, 40, a longtime friend of Mr. Carranza’s who is the leader of a fisherman’s association in Santa Marta, said he was certain that Mr. Carranza was killed in the Sept. 15 strike.\n\nUpon seeing the attack on social media, Mr. Vega said that the type of boat in the video was precisely the kind used by fishermen from Santa Marta, in contrast to differently designed boats departing from Venezuela.\n\n“I immediately thought, ‘He’s one of ours,’” said Mr. Vega. He added that the destroyed boat had two motors instead of the three or four used on boats typically used to smuggle drugs or other contraband.\n\nFishermen can be gone for a week or so, often sleeping in hammocks on deserted beaches, he said.\n\n“But two months gone, no way,” Mr. Vega added. Looking at factors like the dates of Mr. Carranza’s departure and that of the U.S. attack, along with the boat seen in the video, he said he could come to only one conclusion: “Sadly, my friend is dead.”\n\nMr. Vega said Mr. Carranza had been well known for his easygoing personality among other fishermen in Santa Marta. He was known by the nickname “Coroncoro,” which refers to a small fish typically found in the area, and enjoyed drinking beer and playing pool.\n\nBeyond what Mr. Carranza’s family is grappling with, the U.S. strikes have struck fear among Santa Marta’s fishermen, Mr. Vega said, and made them reluctant to do their work.\n\nIt is now tuna season, he said, usually one of the most lucrative times for fishermen to head out. But fears of what might await them there has virtually ground fishing to a standstill, he added.\n\nGenevieve Glatsky and Simón Posada contributed reporting from Bogotá, Colombia.\n\n"}]}
