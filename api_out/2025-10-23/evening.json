been transparent about its plans.\n \n\n   \n  “When this plan was presented, and when these renderings, as soon as they were complete, the president directed me to come out here and to share them

The longer it lingers, the more rain it dumps and the more likely it is to rapidly intensify into a monster storm.\n \n\n   \n  Intensity forecasts have ramped up considerably in the past few days. A worst-case scenario for some Caribbean islands is increasingly likely with Melissa set to reach at least Category 4 hurricane strength next week, fueled by extremely warm water.\n \n\n   \n  A tropical storm warning is in effect for Jamaica with Melissa’s outermost winds expected to reach there in the next day or so. Hurricane watches are in effect for Jamaica and parts of Haiti, meaning hurricane-force winds are possible by the weekend. Haiti, Jamaica and parts of the Dominican Republic face days of heavy rain that threaten significant flash flooding and dangerous mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica could end up being the epicenter of the worst Melissa has to offer, based on current forecasts. Preparations were well underway in the country Thursday as officials urged residents to take Melissa seriously and stay vigilant.\n \n\n   \n  All public hospitals are set to go into “emergency mode” Thursday evening, Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness confirmed at  a news conference . This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, Minister of Science, Energy, Telecommunications and Transport.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday afternoon, Melissa was about 200 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 45 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s drifting north-northwest at just 2 mph, slower than the average person on an afternoon stroll.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is forecast to reach hurricane strength by the weekend and will likely rapidly intensify into a  major hurricane  — Category 3 or greater — Monday. This explosive strengthening is  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is already bringing heavy rain to parts of the Caribbean. Up to 10 inches of rain could fall, with isolated totals topping a foot across southern Haiti, southern Dominican Republic and eastern Jamaica through the weekend. Those totals will likely climb even higher early next week, but by exactly how much depends on Melissa’s track and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  The United States mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct  hit looks unlikely. If Melissa takes longer to turn north, it could bend toward eastern Cuba or the Bahamas before curving into the Atlantic. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also still a slim chance that Melissa takes a sharp turn to the north earlier than expected and bears down directly on Haiti. That scenario would deliver highly-concentrated impacts there and torrential rain to the Dominican Republic.\n \n\n   \n    Why Melissa’s forecast is so alarming\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s path and strength will keep evolving in the days ahead, but the warning signs are already there for millions of vulnerable people in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/russia-sanctions-gas-prices","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"Trump’s challenge: Hurting Putin without harming Americans at the gas pump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s proposed sanctions on Russia, the world’s second-largest crude oil producer, are raising concerns about the impact on U.S. gas prices. While the move aims to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine by weakening his war economy, analysts warn that removing Russian oil exports could trigger a modest rise in fuel prices—expected to increase from $3.07 to $3.15 per gallon. The strategy relies on China and other buyers purchasing Russian oil at discounts, which would harm Russian revenues without causing a full market shock. Experts stress that this is a high-risk, narrow window of opportunity, given that low oil prices have made the timing strategic but the outcome uncertain.

Analysis by Matt Egan, Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:13 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s sanctions crackdown on Russia risks undermining one of the bright spots in the Trump economy: tame gas prices.\n \n\n   \n  The surprising  decision to punish Russia , the second-biggest crude oil producer on the planet, instantly sent oil prices surging Wednesday. Analysts say pump prices are likely to rise modestly in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge for Trump is how to break the Russian war machine without causing a painful price spike that would exacerbate lingering frustrations about the cost of living among voters.\n \n\n   \n  “The market is reacting with shock today. Many thought Trump would never do this,” Bob McNally, founder and president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, told CNN in a phone interview. “Once the shock wears off, we think prices will settle down. However, it’s a close call. There isn’t a lot of margin for error.”\n \n\n   \n  Record-high gas prices haunted the Biden-Harris administration after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. And high prices across the economy helped propel Trump back to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump is trying to force an end to that deadly war while keeping gas prices low. It’s a risky strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “If Trump does anything that abruptly removes Russian oil exports, we would have an immediate explosion in oil prices,” said McNally, who worked as an energy adviser to former President George W. Bush.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has the advantage of operating from a position of strength when it comes to prices.\n \n\n   \n  Up until the past few days, oil prices were trading near multi-year lows. Gas prices, as measured by AAA, looked destined to break through the psychologically important $3-a-gallon level.\n \n\n   \n  “If you want to send a strong signal to Russia, now is exactly the right time to do it when prices are low,” said Dave Turk, who served as deputy energy secretary under President Joe Biden and is now a distinguished visiting fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n \n\n   \n  This setup gives Trump some breathing room to crank up the pressure on Moscow in a bid to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table.\n \n\n   \n  Trump credits his drill-baby-drill agenda — and it is true that US oil production is at all-time highs. But that world-leading oil output hasn’t changed much since Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  What has changed is willingness from OPEC and Saudi Arabia to pump lots more oil in a bid to regain market share lost to, among others, frackers in Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “The confluence of events has enabled the United States to take a harder line with Russia,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.\n \n\n   \n  But too hard of a line could backfire by driving up the highly visible cost of gasoline, which many Americans view as a proxy for the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “It will be a calibrated effort to hurt Putin while protecting motorists,” said McNally.\n \n\n   \n  GasBuddy’s Patrick De Haan expects gas prices to rise in the coming days, but only modestly from $3.07 a gallon on Thursday to $3.10 to $3.15.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not going to be earth-shattering,” De Haan told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  McNally expects the Trump administration to try to thread the needle by making it harder — but not impossible — to buy Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  If China and others can keep buying Russian barrels, but at a significant discount to world oil prices, it could prevent a shortage that drives up prices for American consumers. But it would also punish Putin by shrinking the oil revenue that funds the Russian war machine.\n \n\n   \n  Will it work?\n \n\n   \n  McNally said the most likely scenario is that Russia keeps oil flowing at a steeper discount to Brent oil prices, but he cautioned there is a real risk that Moscow instead is forced to slash production.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a close call,” McNally said.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes are massive for consumers, the US economy and for the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Polls already indicate voters feel Trump is not doing enough to address affordability. And that’s with low gas prices.\n \n\n   \n  “If you want to remain in power, you’ve got to be laser-focused on affordability,” said Turk, the former Biden official. “That’s a big lesson I took away from the prior four years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/binance-founder-trump-pardon","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump Pardons Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in 2023 and was sentenced to four months in prison.

 \n  By Alayna Treene, Allison Morrow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:53 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has pardoned  Binance  founder  Changpeng Zhao , who pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in 2023, the White House said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Trump “exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt argued that the Biden administration’s sentencing of Zhao was too harsh — a view the president and his top advisers share after Binance’s months-long lobbying campaign for a pardon for Zhao, who goes by CZ.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, could open the door for Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, to operate in the US once again.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a former crypto skeptic who did a 180 on the alternative financial assets while running for a second term, has pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet.” In launching a multi-faceted crypto empire, the Trump family has also established direct financial links to Binance over the past year.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial — on which their wealth is increasingly dependent — is hosted on Binance. The exchange has also helped popularize World Liberty Financial’s proprietary tokens, the sale of which has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the Trump family.\n \n\n   \n  The Wall Street Journal estimated that World Liberty Financial has added  more than $5 billion  in paper wealth to the Trump family fortune — eclipsing the president’s real estate assets.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, MGX, an Emirati-backed investment firm,  agreed to use  World Liberty’s dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1, for a $2 billion investment in Binance. The deal was a huge win for World Liberty Financial, which effectively received a $2 billion bank deposit. At the time, Binance was actively lobbying for Zhao’s pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Asked at Thursday’s White House press briefing about Democratic criticisms of the pardon as corrupt, Leavitt said the White House has “a very thorough examination of every pardon request that comes to the president’s desk.”\n \n\n   \n  She told reporters that she spoke directly with the White House counsel about the pardon, and that the administration believes Zhao’s case was “overly prosecuted” under the Biden administration, which she claimed was “very hostile to the cryptocurrency industry.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison in May 2024 after  pleading guilty  to charges that he failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance, the crypto exchange he founded in 2017, and agreed to pay $200 million in fines. The company agreed to pay more than $4 billion in fines and other penalties as part of a  coordinated settlement  with the federal government in 2023. Binance admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering activities, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao isn’t the only crypto mogul to win a reprieve from Trump since his return to the White House. Shortly after returning to office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, a cause celebre of the Libertarian crypto world, who had been serving a life sentence for creating the Silk Road marketplace, which the Justice Department had described as “the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today.”\n \n\n   \n  Justin Sun, the Chinese crypto billionaire who poured tens of millions of dollars into World Liberty Financial soon after it launched, had been facing civil fraud charges in the United States under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission  dropped the case against Sun  in February. And, in March, Trump  pardoned three co-founders of BitMEX , a crypto exchange, who had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering programs.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/illinois-governor-candidate-family-killed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:48:00-04:00","title":"Four family members of Illinois governor candidate killed in Montana helicopter crash, campaign says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Four members of the family of Darren Bailey, a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Illinois, were killed in a helicopter crash in eastern Montana.

He once supported a resolution seeking to make Chicago a separate state.\n \n\n   \n  Bailey unsuccessfully challenged five-term incumbent  Republican U.S. Rep.

Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President  JD Vance left Israel on Thursday  with an optimistic note, saying Rafah, a city in the southern Gaza strip, could be rebuilt in two to three years.\n \n\n   \n  Vance said Palestinians should be able to move into a “Hamas free zone” in southern Gaza “in the next couple of months.”\n \n\n   \n  He told reporters in Tel Aviv before he boarded Air Force Two that the hope is for people to be able to move back to Rafah. Vance said the reconstruction effort could start “very quickly” in areas not under Hamas control.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re going to have first some people, and then more, and then hopefully in a couple years, a half a million people living in security, living in comfort, and also living in a situation where they’re not threatening their Israeli neighbors,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  It is the first time the US administration has spoken in detail about the potential timeline for the  reconstruction of Gaza , which has been devastated in two years of war.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s visit this week to the region was meant, at least in part, to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to the US-negotiated deal as some Trump administration officials worry he could work to thwart it,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Vance told reporters Thursday that, so far, both Israel and Hamas are respecting the ceasefire with “exceptions.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are little exceptions to break out here and there that would be expected when these two parties have been at war for two years. But so far, the ceasefire is actually holding. The peace is actually holding,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance said he felt “pretty good” about maintaining the fragile peace but did admit there was potential for “little breakouts of violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look, if this peace sticks, you’re going to have these little breakouts of violence. Our message to the Israelis has been: ‘help us build this peace.’ Obviously, the Israelis have their own interests, but we’re going to keep on trying to work with both them and the Gulf-Arab states to make this peace stick,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance acknowledged the upcoming challenges the ceasefire will face as mediators try to create a mechanism to carry out the disarmament of Hamas. The responsibility will ultimately fall to an international force to be deployed to Gaza, an effort that Vance said will require patience.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hope in the administration is that the International Security Force is going to now take the lead in disarming Hamas,” he said. “That’s going to take some time, and it’s going to depend a lot on the composition of that force.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who landed just hours after Vance flew out, said the ceasefire effort remains a top priority for US President Donald Trump. He said that the efforts to date are “a very important achievement,” but added that “there’s more work to be done and bigger achievements that lie ahead, and so we’re here to work on that.”\n \n\n   \n  “We feel very positive and confident that we’re going to get there, despite substantial obstacles. We’re going to get there,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Vance criticizes Israeli vote on West Bank\n \n\n   \n  The US vice president slammed a pair of preliminary votes in Israel’s parliament designed to advance annexation of the occupied West Bank – territory that the international community considers part of a future Palestinian state. Vance said he had been told the votes were “symbolic” and a “political stunt.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally take some insult to it,” Vance told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  One bill to annex the West Bank passed by a single vote, 25-24, while a more limited bill to annex the settlement of Maale Adumim passed by a much wider margin, 32-9. In both cases, more than half of Israel’s Knesset did not vote. Netanyahu and his Likud party opposed the measure, but it passed in its preliminary reading anyway.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement that the bills “are unlikely to go anywhere” and were intended by the opposition to “sow discord” during Vance’s visit, even though the West Bank annexation bill only passed because of the support of Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition partners.\n \n\n   \n   Annexing all or parts of the West Bank  has been a goal of Israel’s right-wing for years. Many hardliners had celebrated Donald Trump’s presidency as an opportunity to advance that agenda, believing he would provide American support to a measure that would immediately face a massive international backlash. But Vance poured cold water on the idea of applying Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy.”\n \n\n   \n  A broad coalition of Arab and Muslim states, led by Saudi Arabia, blasted the Knesset vote as a “blatant violation of international law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement issued by the Saudi Foreign Ministry, the group said in a sharp rebuke that “Israel’s continued unilateral policies and illegal practices will further undermine international law and morality.” They called on Israel to stop expanding settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, meanwhile, has made the expansion of  the Abraham Accords  one of its top foreign policy goals. The accords saw Israel normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and others, representing Trump’s biggest foreign policy achievement from his first term. The US is now trying to advance normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh has made clear that it would only happen with a viable pathway to Palestinian statehood, something openly dismissed by Israel’s right-wing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told  Time Magazine in an interview published on Thursday  that “Saudi Arabia will lead the way toward the Abraham Accords.” When asked whether he thought the country would join the accords by the end of the year, Trump responded, “Yes, I do. I do.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said at a domestic conference on Thursday, however, “If Saudi Arabia tells us, ‘Normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,’ then friends – no thank you. Keep riding your camels In the desert – and we’ll continue building a technological powerhouse.”\n \n\n   \n  Smotrich has repeatedly made clear that one of his top priorities is annexing the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  In the Time interview, Trump bluntly said he won’t allow it.\n \n\n   \n  “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. It will not happen,” he said. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking about the Israel-Hamas war, Trump also said that Netanyahu “would have just kept going” were it not for his intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “It would have gone on for years. And I stopped him, and everybody came together when I stopped, it was amazing,” said Trump. He said the failed Israeli strike in Doha targeting senior Hamas leaders was one of the key moments that helped bring about the ceasefire “because it was so out of joint that it sort of got everybody to do what they have to do.”\n \n\n   \n   Jennifer Hansler and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/climate/florida-coral-reef-heatwave-extinct","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"Critical Florida corals now ‘functionally extinct’ due to off-the-charts ocean temperatures","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A study led by NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch and Shedd Aquarium reveals that elkhorn and staghorn corals — once dominant reef builders in Florida — are now functionally extinct due to a marine heat wave in 2023, which pushed ocean temperatures above 90°F for three months.

off-the-charts ocean temperatures \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Elkhorn and staghorn corals used to carpet Florida’s reef system, rising like antlers from the seabed — but not anymore. These  crucial coral species  are now “functionally extinct” in the region after record-breaking   ocean temperatures, according to a study published Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The corals, which have been dominant reef builders in Florida for the past 10,000 years, were already critically endangered due to a host of factors including disease, pollution, hurricanes and ocean warming. But an  unprecedented  marine heat wave may have delivered a fatal blow.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 2023, Florida’s water temperatures peaked at more than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest recorded in the region for at least 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Heat stress is a coral killer. It causes them to eject the algae that provide them with their color and energy, leaving behind a ghostly bleached skeleton. They can recover if temperatures return to normal, but the more intense and prolonged the heat, the more likely it is they will die.\n \n\n   \n  The 2023 heatwave in Florida lasted roughly three months. As the high temperatures persisted, researchers dove beneath the water to closely monitor more than 52,300 Acropora corals, a group that includes staghorn and elkhorn corals. The study area covered all of  Florida’s coral reef system , which stretches nearly 350 miles from the Dry Tortugas and Florida Keys in the southwest to the St. Lucie Inlet on the state’s east coast.\n \n\n   \n  By March 2024, an astonishing 98% to 100% of colonies on the southern end of the system had died, according to the study, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch and Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium.\n \n\n   \n  The heat wave marks the “functional extinction” of the colonies, the report found, a term marking the stage that often precedes the complete disappearance of a species.\n \n\n   \n  While some elkhorn and staghorn corals remain, they are “no longer in densities high enough to carry out their ecological role — in this case, building and maintaining the reef structure,” said Ross Cunning, a research biologist at Shedd Aquarium and a study author.\n \n\n   \n  The surviving remnants of colonies, mainly located toward the north end of the reef system, are also vulnerable to disease, predators and storm damage.\n \n\n   \n  The loss of these corals sets off “cascading impacts,” Cunning told CNN. “Reef growth slows, habitat complexity declines, and fish and invertebrates lose shelter and resources they depend on,” he said. It also leaves coastlines more exposed to storms and erosion.\n \n\n   \n  The report’s findings are “a stark warning for the future of coral reefs worldwide,” the authors wrote in a statement accompanying their research.\n \n\n   \n  A recent study from the University of Exeter found the planet’s warm water coral reefs have already been pushed  passed a tipping point  by climate change, and   reefs on any meaningful scale will be lost   unless global warming is reversed.\n \n\n   \n  In Florida, natural recovery of Acropora corals is unlikely, the new report concludes. Climate projections suggest severe bleaching will occur every year by 2040 and, as oceans continue to warm, other coral species are likely to die off, too. “True global extinctions” of multiple coral species could happen in the coming decades for the whole Caribbean region, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have tried to  artificially bolster  Florida’s coral populations by rearing colonies in nurseries both onshore and offshore, but the   success of these efforts will depend on the frequency and severity of future bleaching events, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings are “extremely significant” and drive home the importance of immediate action to cut planet-heating pollution, said Keri O’Neil, director and senior scientist of the Coral Conservation Program at the Florida Aquarium, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  But functional extinction does not mean the species will go completely extinct, she added. “Human intervention, combined with improved ocean conditions, can reverse this trend.”\n \n\n   \n  Cunning said the report should not be interpreted as “a message of hopelessness” but instead as a call to action. “The window to prevent further losses is rapidly closing, yet targeted interventions and aggressive climate action can still make the difference.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/media/ellison-wbd-trump-warner-bros-discovery-bid","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:32:00-20:00","title":"David Ellison May Have a 'Trump Card' — Literally — in Warner Bros.

His ambitions are bolstered by his father, Larry Ellison, Oracle’s executive chairman, who currently ranks as the second-richest man in the world. Together they are “building an unprecedented media empire,” as The Washington Post put it earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  However, so far, WBD has turned down the Ellison entreaties. Zaslav, who has led WBD since it was formed through a 2022 combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery, is insisting that the company is worth more than the $23.50 per share that Ellison most recently offered.\n \n\n   \n  And the WBD board agrees, having unanimously voted to reject that bid.\n \n\n   \n  Zaslav is talking internally about how HBO Max and the Warner Bros. movie studio would fit well with Amazon or Netflix, according to a person involved in the conversations.\n \n\n   \n  NBCUniversal’s parent company, Comcast, is also taking a look at WBD’s assets, sources told CNN earlier.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s for-sale announcement signaled that many outcomes are possible: A deal for all of WBD, a deal for the company’s streaming and studio assets to another company, or the already-planned split of WBD into two publicly traded halves.\n \n\n   \n  Lest there is any doubt, Ellison does want to buy all the WBD assets, including CNN, even though Warner is newly willing to sell pieces, sources with knowledge of the talks said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellison’s recent acquisition of The Free Press and installation of Bari Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief evinces a deep interest in news — in ways that worry some and excite others.\n \n\n   \n    The Trump factor matters\n \n\n   \n  Paramount’s pursuit of WBD raises big questions about billionaire control of major media conglomerates. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for one, has been raising her voice about potential consumer harms.\n \n\n   \n  And Wall Street analysts have been asserting that President Trump’s personal preferences may weigh heavily on the deal process. The commentary is a stark reminder of how the president has reshaped the government in his own image.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly praised the Ellisons in recent months. “They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” the president said in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  “They will make the right decisions,” Trump added. “They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s praise is notable partly because the younger Ellison was a big Democratic donor as recently as last year. He was spotted schmoozing near Trump at two different UFC matches earlier this year, though, and he agreed to several conditions imposed by the Trump-aligned FCC in order to complete his takeover of Paramount.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the elder Ellison has expressed support for Trump in the past and has been leading a group of investors who intend to buy TikTok’s US assets, potentially giving Trump a political and cultural win.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount is leveraging these presidential relationships as it pursues WBD. “Trump’s implicit support for the deal is their number one talking point,” a person involved in the negotiations said.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount insiders refute that, noting that Ellison made many pro-deal arguments in a letter to WBD’s board that The New York Times obtained on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that we are the best partner for WBD,” Ellison wrote in the letter, “with a combination of our two companies creating a scaled Hollywood champion to the benefit of both our companies’ shareholders, consumers and the entertainment industry at large.”\n \n\n   \n  Some analysts have backed up those arguments. Paramount’s bid “makes a lot of strategic sense by owning a much stronger slate of I.P. at Warner Bros. and seeking scale with the combined HBO Max and Paramount+ platforms,” Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson said in a note to investors.\n \n\n   \n  Fishman also said that “combining the linear network portfolios would also likely yield significant cost synergies, while unlocking strategic benefits from pairing CBS News with CNN and leveraging the long-standing CBS-Turner partnership for NCAA’s March Madness Final Four plus other overlapping sports rights portfolios.”\n \n\n   \n  But Warner’s leaders argue that Paramount is not fully valuing its assets. Plus, though the Trump factor looms large, US regulators are not the only government officials to consider.\n \n\n   \n  A Paramount-WBD deal would face regulatory scrutiny in the United Kingdom, the European Union and some Latin American countries. The perception of Trump clearing the way for the Ellisons in the US could hurt them in other markets, sources said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/science/new-mexico-dinosaur-site","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:32:00Z","title":"Rare look at the last days of the dinosaurs shows they were thriving, scientists say","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study of the Naashoibito Member site in northwestern New Mexico reveals that dinosaurs were thriving and diverse just before their extinction 66 million years ago, challenging the long-standing belief that they were in decline.

   2:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A site in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico is providing a rare glimpse into the last days of the dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  Rocks and fossils at the Naashoibito Member site show an ecosystem that was filled with a diverse population of dinosaurs just before they disappeared from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Paleontologists have long debated if the dinosaurs  suddenly went extinct  when a 6.2-mile-wide (10-kilometer-wide) asteroid crashed into Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous Period, or if they were in a gradual decline and living in weakened ecosystems ahead of the catastrophic event.\n \n\n   \n  Answering that question requires finding fossils and dating the surrounding rock to come up with an accurate timeline of the site. But identifying fossils in an area accurately dated to just before the extinction event is rare.\n \n\n   \n  A key site of interest for paleontologists has been the well-studied Hell Creek and Fort Union Formations, located in what is now Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.\n \n\n   \n   Hell Creek  has preserved evidence of multiple species of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, as well as rocks, dated to the end of the Cretaceous Period, or just before the dinosaurs went extinct. But the dinosaur community there completely lacked any long-necked species, causing scientists to wonder if those had already disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Now, new research has dated rocks in the Naashoibito Member to the same time period as the Hell Creek Formation, revealing what kinds of dinosaurs lived in different parts of North America just a few hundred thousand years before going extinct.\n \n\n   \n  Among the dinosaurs that lived in the Naashoibito Member was Alamosaurus, one of the largest long-necked dinosaurs that ever lived, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal  Science .\n \n\n   \n  “What our new research shows is that dinosaurs are not on their way out going into the mass extinction,” lead study author Andrew Flynn, assistant professor in the department of geological sciences at New Mexico State University, said in a statement. “They’re doing great, they’re thriving, and that the asteroid impact seems to knock them out. This counters a long-held idea that there was this long-term decline in dinosaur diversity leading up to the mass extinction making them more prone to extinction.”\n \n\n   \n    Cracking the rock time code\n \n\n   \n  Dinosaur fossils were first found in the San Juan Basin beginning in the mid- to late 1800s.\n \n\n   \n  But dating the rock layers containing the fossils is more complicated, Flynn said. First, the layers need to be exposed so they can be studied, and then the rocks themselves must be dated.\n \n\n   \n  “These factors make dinosaur-bearing rocks from the last 400,000 years of the Cretaceous quite rare,” Flynn said.  “Additionally, it takes years of work to establish the ages of rocks, with multiple lines of evidence needing to be collected, which sometimes discourages people from going to new areas to work.”\n \n\n   \n  The fossil record is not neatly organized, and some chapters are missing.\n \n\n   \n  “Species might have failed to enter the fossil record, they might have been preserved as fossils but not yet discovered, or they might have been discovered but lack essential context, such as precise estimates of geological age,” wrote Dr. Lindsay Zanno, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a  related article  published with the research. Zanno was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  The Naashoibito Member site is problematic because erosion has stripped it of the perfect layers of rock found at other sites in North America, making it difficult to determine when the layers were created, Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  Work at the site to determine a more detailed timeline of dinosaur habitation began in 2011. The team members measured the thickness and location of different rock layers, collected samples for testing and identified all of the spots where fossils were found over the last century and a half.  Sample collection  lasted about three to four years just for Cretaceous rocks, while another four to five were spent on the overlying rock that shows when mammals lived at the site after the dinosaurs went extinct.\n \n\n   \n  One way the team was able to date the rocks was by comparing the samples with Earth’s magnetic field, which periodically changes direction. For instance, right now,  magnetic north  aligns with the direction of north. But sometimes, magnetic north can align with the direction of south. Scientists have a clear understanding of when these reversals have occurred over time. By measuring the direction of the magnetic field when the rock layers were created, researchers can narrow down the time frame.\n \n\n   \n  “The end-Cretaceous mass extinction, fortunately for us, took place during a relatively short period of reversed polarity, which makes it much easier to say what our data correlates to,” Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  The team also used radiometric dating — or measuring the decay of certain elements in rocks to determine their ages — on sand grains from sandstone in the Naashoibito Member.\n \n\n   \n  Their results showed that the dinosaur fossils were from a 380,000-year window leading up to the mass extinction event. The team also determined that mammals appeared about 350,000 years after the mass extinction event.\n \n\n   \n    Regions of diverse dinosaurs\n \n\n   \n  The new study paints a portrait of two very different dinosaur communities divided between the north and south regions of the continent.\n \n\n   \n  Both areas had dinosaurs in common, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Torosaurus. Fossils of duck-billed dinosaurs were also found at each location, but they belonged to different groups. There were no giant, long-necked sauropods to be found in the north, which for a long time led some paleontologists to think that after millions of years of pushing the boundaries of evolution with their humongous sizes, they had gone extinct, said study coauthor Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n  But they flourished in the south, including Alamosaurus, which reached 100 feet (30 meters) long, a height of 30 to 50 feet (9 to 15 meters) and weighed over 30 tons,   Brusatte said. The fact that one of the biggest dinosaurs, and one of the largest animals ever to live on Earth, witnessed an asteroid striking the planet truly illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving to the very end, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I can imagine the scene, one minute a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid,” Brusatte said.\n \n\n   \n  Part of the reason for the differing groups divided between north and south was likely due to climate conditions, Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  The Naashoibito Member site   was like a warm and humid tropical forest, similar to conditions in modern Panama, while the Hell Creek area was at a much lower elevation and included the cooler conditions of an inland sea coastal plain.\n \n\n   \n  “They were doing what dinosaurs had been doing for over 150 million years, adapting to their local conditions, dividing up niches in the food chain, varying in size and shape and diet, exhibiting rich diversity across the landscape,” Brusatte said. “There is no sign that these dinosaurs were in any trouble.”\n \n\n   \n  The new evidence about diverse, late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is exciting, said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the School of Earth Sciences at the UK’s University of Bristol. Benton was not involved in the new study, and his previous research has suggested a decline in dinosaur populations before the asteroid strike.\n \n\n   \n  “However, this is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world,” Benton wrote in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “As the authors also show in the paper, in general dinosaurs of the last 6 million years of the Cretaceous were less diverse, falling from 43 species beforehand to 30 species in western North America. We would suggest that there is evidence for overall declines in dinosaurs towards the end of the Cretaceous, with individual rich faunas where climates were favourable.”\n \n\n   \n  But Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor within the department of Earth, energy, and environment at the University of Calgary, said she﻿ believes the new findings   could   change how researchers think about dinosaurs in North America before the mass extinction event.\n \n\n   \n  Zelenitsky was not involved in the new research, but her team’s ongoing work in Alberta uncovering fossil eggshells linked to diverse dinosaur species aligns with the findings about stable dinosaur populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The research team uncovered compelling new evidence (…) that dinosaurs were still going strong ‘til the very end,” Zelenitsky wrote in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The new study may focus on dinosaurs, but the fact that 75% of species on Earth disappeared at the same time contains a lesson that remains applicable today, Brusatte said.\n \n\n   \n  “Sudden climate and environmental change can catch animals and ecosystems unaware,” he said, “and can defeat even the strongest and most iconic of species.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/us-mortgage-rates","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-04:00","title":"Mortgage Rates Fall to Lowest Level of 2025","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mortgage rates in the U.S. fell to 6.19% for the week ending October 23, 2025, the lowest level in over a year, according to Freddie Mac data.

that led to arrests of Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and NBA star Terry Rozier \n       \n  By Dana O'Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones  are among 34 people indicted in connection  with two separate federal gambling investigations announced by the Eastern District of New York on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  At a lengthy and at times spirited news conference that included FBI Director Kash Patel, US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr., and others detailed the sweeping multi-year investigations that spanned 11 states, resulted in the arrests of 34 people, involved tens of millions of dollars and included members of the notorious Bonanno, Genovese, Gambino and Luchese crime families.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, who coached in the Trail Blazers’ opening game on Wednesday night, was arrested in Portland on Thursday morning and is expected to appear in federal court there later on Thursday. Rozier, arrested in Orlando, will appear there.\n \n\n   \n  Both will be arraigned at a later date in Brooklyn.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, who retired in 2012, is one of three people to be charged in both cases.\n \n\n   \n  “My message to the defendants who have been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,’’ Nocella said. “Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that.’’\n \n\n   \n  Billups, the Portland head coach since 2021, is charged in an elaborate scheme in which marks were lured to participate in rigged poker games in part with the opportunity to play alongside the NBA five-time All-Star as well as Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, Nocella said, knowingly served as the so-called “face card,” to attract the “fish,” to underground games in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and the Hamptons that they had no chance of winning. Those involved in the scheme used rigged card-shuffling machines, poker chip trays and even special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. In some instances, the alleged conspirators used X-ray tables that reveal cards when they are placed face down.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said the scheme, deemed “Zen Diagram” by the feds, “fleeced” victims out of tens of millions of dollars. One alleged victim lost $1.8 million. The money was then laundered by the crime families.\n \n\n   \n  “And when people refused to pay, these defendants did what organized crime has always done,’’ New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “They used threats. They used intimidation. And they used violence. It’s the same pattern that we have seen for decades, traditional mob enforcement methods combined with new technology to expand the reach of their operations.’’\n \n\n   \n  Rozier, who was arrested in an Orlando hotel, was alleged to participate in a game-fixing scheme that included prop bets on his availability.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators allege between December 2022 and March 2024, Rozier tipped people about his availability for games, citing seven specific games in their investigation including one, against the New Orleans Pelicans, already flagged by sportsbooks for irregular activity.\n \n\n   \n  In that March 2023 game, Rozier, then with the Charlotte Hornets, left the game after just nine minutes with an injury. According to investigators, Rozier shared that inside information, and his co-conspirator bettors made $200,000 in wagers on the under.\n \n\n   \n  “Those bets paid out, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profit,’’ Tisch said. “The proceeds were later delivered to his home, where the group counted their cash.’’\n \n\n   \n  That investigation, deemed “Nothing But Net,” also included the previous arrest of former Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter, who was banned from the NBA in 2024 and later admitted to manipulating his performance in two games. He is awaiting sentencing.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said other defendants involved in the case threatened Porter, who had pre-existing gambling debts, in order to get the inside information.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the insider trading saga of the NBA,’’ FBI Director Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA has said previously it looked into the game involving Rozier against the Pelicans and that no rules had been broken. He was with the Heat, who opened their season on Wednesday, but did not play due to a coach’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying that prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.\n \n\n   \n  “But at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel,’’ Trusty said.\n \n\n   \n  “They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case. They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Trail Blazers and other teams mentioned in the news conference. Attorney information for Billups was not immediately available.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the NBA said, “We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today. Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.”\n \n\n   \n  The Heat directed press inquiries to the NBA statement. The Trail Blazers noted that Tiago Splitter will be taking on interim head coaching duties as Billups is on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the allegations involving head coach Chauncey Billups, and the Trail Blazers are fully cooperating with the investigation. Billups has been placed on immediate leave, and Tiago Splitter will assume head coaching duties in the interim. Any further questions should be directed to the NBA,” the Blazers said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell and Mark Morales contributed reporting to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/us-cpi-september-inflation-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-04:00","title":"A tiny light in an economic data blackout is about to shine through the shutdown for a brief moment","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a two-dozen-day federal government shutdown that halted most economic data releases, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the September 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Friday, October 23, 2025.

12:41 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nearly two dozen days have passed since a federal agency  has published an economic report . The US government’s shutdown has resulted in a blackout of critical data,  further clouding  an already opaque economic outlook.\n \n\n   \n  That will change – albeit briefly – Friday morning, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release the Consumer Price Index report for September.\n \n\n   \n  The September CPI will allow the data-hungry to get a little fix, providing a snapshot of how prices are trending for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  The report is a one-off of sorts:  BLS staff were called back into the office  this month   to allow the government to meet statutory requirements in adjusting Social Security payments for next year. The September CPI is the final piece of data needed for the 2026 cost of living adjustment.\n \n\n   \n  So, after the CPI is released, darkness once again will envelop federal economic data until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  (And as for the report itself, economists tell CNN that despite the circumstances behind the delayed release, they’re not concerned about the integrity of the underlying data.)\n \n\n   \n    Expect inflation to move back above 3%\n \n\n   \n  Economists expect the latest data to show   that prices for a slew of commonly purchased goods and services rose at a faster-than-typical clip (0.4%) last month. This would lift the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3.1% – the fastest pace in more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  There are many factors behind the upswing, including: pricier gas, food and tariff-impacted goods as well as slower-than-anticipated reduction in inflation on the services side – notably housing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s helpful to remember that the last time inflation was below 2% was in February 2021, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview.\n \n\n   \n  “At the macro level, it’s a reminder of how sticky inflation can be when it gets out of the tube and how hard it is to get to back to that 2% once it’s been above target for a while,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The foods likely to get pricier\n \n\n   \n  American consumers have weathered nearly five years of prices rising faster than they typically should (and prices rose far, far faster than usual for two of those years). However, years of high inflation have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  Food prices, for example, have risen 24% between 2020 and 2024, noted Billy Roberts, senior analyst for food and beverage at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses and rural firms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen smaller degrees of inflation, even over the course of this year, but it’s really that cumulative effect,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In August,  grocery prices jumped 0.6% , the highest monthly increase in nearly three years, according to BLS data. Economists expect the September gain to be more mellow; however, certain categories likely will highlight pain points.\n \n\n   \n  Beef prices, for example,  have risen dramatically  in recent years as herds have shrunk amid  prolonged drought .  Cocoa  and  coffee prices , which have been pushed higher by  climate change  stifling supply, now  face further pressures from tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  Consumers stocking up for trick-or-treaters are now seeing the effects, Roberts said, noting cocoa prices are “still about double, if not triple, what they were in 2022-’23.”\n \n\n   \n  “Those aren’t items that consumers necessarily buy week in and week out,” but they’re buying in bulk now for Halloween, he said. “Those prices are going to provide a lot of sticker shock for consumers.”\n \n\n   \n    The K-shaped economy fallout\n \n\n   \n  Food prices remain a sore spot for many Americans  as do electricity prices , which also have been on the rise, Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those categories, Brusuelas noted he’ll be monitoring services-related inflation — such as airfare and other discretionary areas — and whether it’s remaining stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “What I am concerned about is the sticky and stubborn service sector costs along with rising food and utility prices, which are really placing stress on middle-class and down-market households,” he said. “And this is a function of that greater discussion around the K-shaped economy, where 40% of this country is thriving.”\n \n\n   \n  A recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics found that the country’s top-earners (who have benefited from a surging stock market, rising wages and increased housing wealth)  are accounting for an even greater share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  “Down market,” Brusuelas added, “it’s a very different reality.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-updates-teen-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:32:00-14:00","title":"Microsoft AI CEO: We’re making an AI that you can trust your kids to use","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman is leading a mission to create a safe, trustworthy AI experience for children by explicitly banning romantic and erotic content, contrasting with competitors like OpenAI and Meta who allow such interactions.

That’s well below competitors like OpenAI, whose  ChatGPT has 800 million  monthly active users.\n \n\n   \n  But Microsoft is betting its approach will win it a wider audience, especially as AI companies grapple with how to shape their chatbot’s personalities amid reports of AI  contributing to users’ mental health crises .\n \n\n   \n  “We must build AI for people; not to be a digital person,” Suleyman wrote in a blog post earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The interview came ahead of a series of  new Copilot features  that Microsoft unveiled on Thursday, which include the ability to refer back to previous chats, engage in group conversations, improved responses to health questions and an optional, sassy tone called “real talk.”\n \n\n   \n    Saying no to erotica\n \n\n   \n  Some of Microsoft’s AI competitors are facing intense pressure to keep young users safe on their platforms.\n \n\n   \n  Families have sued  OpenAI  and  Character.AI  claiming their chatbots harmed their children, in some cases allegedly contributing to their suicides. A string of  reports  earlier this year raised concerns that Meta’s chatbot and other AI characters would engage in sexual conversations even with accounts identifying as minors.\n \n\n   \n  The tech companies behind popular AI chatbots say they’ve rolled out new protections for kids, including content restrictions and parental controls. Meta and OpenAI are also implementing AI age estimation technology aiming to catch young users who sign up with fake, adult birthdates — but it’s unclear how well those systems work. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  announced  earlier this month that with its new safety precautions in place, ChatGPT will soon let adult users discuss “erotica” with the chatbot.\n \n\n   \n  Suleyman said Microsoft is drawing a bright line at romantic, flirtatious and erotic content, even for adults. “That’s just not something that we will pursue,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  That means, for now, Microsoft is unlikely to roll out a “young user” mode like some of its competitors — because they shouldn’t need it, Suleyman said.\n \n\n   \n    Prioritizing human connection\n \n\n   \n  A key focus for Microsoft is training Copilot to encourage users to interact with other humans, not just AI. That’s key for a company that has built its business around providing work-oriented productivity tools.\n \n\n   \n  Its new “groups” feature will let up to 32 people — think, classmates working on an assignment or friends planning a trip — join a shared chat with Copilot, where the chatbot can chime in with suggestions.\n \n\n   \n  That theme of pointing users to real people applies to Copilot’s health updates, too. The chatbot will recommend nearby doctors for certain medical-related queries, and will otherwise draw on “medically trusted” sources such as Harvard Health.\n \n\n   \n  Suleyman said he believes this push to get Microsoft’s AI chatbot to help strengthen human-to-human relationships “is a very significant tonal shift to other things that are happening in the industry at the moment, which are starting to see these things as deep simulations where you can go off into your own world and have an entire parallel reality, including, in some cases, adult content.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/chess-vladimir-kramnik-daniel-naroditsky-fide-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:32:00-23:10","title":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik investigated for bullying following death of grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is under investigation by FIDE for bullying and harassment following the unexpected death of grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who had been repeatedly accused of cheating in online games.

Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik investigated for bullying following death of grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former world  chess  champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment following the death of fellow player  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator. He was loved by many.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/house-democrats-probe-trump-230-million-doj-payment","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-04:00","title":"House Democrats Launch Probe into Trump’s Potential $230M Payment from His Own Justice Department","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Democrats, led by Reps.

\n       \n  By Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:41 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia are launching an investigation into President Donald Trump’s reported demand that  his own Justice Department hand over $230 million  as compensation for past federal investigations into him, according to a letter obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s ask, made through administrative claims filed in 2023 and 2024, resurfaced in recent days after  The New York Times  reported on the matter and Trump confirmed publicly he “could be” seeking such a payment.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrats on the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees are asking Trump to hand over a slew of documents, including the administrative claims filed by his legal representatives, his communications with his attorneys and government officials on the matter and all DOJ memoranda outlining the legal merits of the claims. Without a subpoena to compel the release of the information, however, it remains unlikely the Democrats’ request will gain much traction.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, the Democrats argue, could have brought his claims to court much earlier. They say that the president is only pursuing this now because he has installed his own personal lawyers within the Department of Justice. It was not immediately clear what steps Trump or his legal team had taken in recent days or weeks to press the claims.\n \n\n   \n  “If either of your claims had any merit, you could have taken them to court by now and litigated them publicly,” Raskin and Garcia wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “You did not do that. Instead, you waited until you became President and installed your handpicked loyalists at DOJ, knowing that you could instruct them to co-sign your demand notes in secret behind closed doors, and then you could present the notes to the U.S. Treasury for cold hard cash courtesy of the American taxpayer. That isn’t justice, it is theft,” they continued.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the Times report, House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN on Thursday that he hasn’t “had time to get the details” and that “it’s still on my list of things to-do.”\n \n\n   \n  However, at least one Republican – Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina – has conceded the president is in a “difficult position” and that the request is “terrible optics.”\n \n\n   \n  “Particularly right now, we’re talking about a quarter of a billion dollars transferring, maybe to the president when we’re in a shutdown posture, so it’s at very best bad timing, but I think it’s horrible optics,” Tillis said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Trump said he “could be” seeking the money, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be,” Trump said from the Oval Office when asked about the Times report.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The president at the time acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself” damages to resolve claims that the Justice Department under his predecessor had wronged him.\n \n\n   \n  “With the country, it’s interesting, because I’m the one that makes the decision,” Trump said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A settlement to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/travel/comedy-wildlife-awards-finalists-2025-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00-04:00","title":"Joyful images from this year’s Comedy Wildlife Awards finalists","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards has selected 40 humorous wildlife images and 10 videos from nearly 10,000 entries submitted by photographers in 108 countries.

program for boosting women in tech \n       \n  By Hadas Gold, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:24 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The email that said the career resource program for women would no longer be part of Google was terse and followed months of eroding support. But the deletion of years of Women Techmakers’ work came as a significant shock to its members.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything that I ever hosted and facilitated for Women Techmakers is gone. And there are just as many ambassadors who were in the community that put in so much effort to be part of this, (and) their history just erased,” Sherry Yang, an engineering manager in Canada and an ambassador for the group, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Google earlier this month offloaded the key career resource program for supporting women in tech and severed its integration within the company. The decision was communicated to members in a short email with little explanation earlier this month. It left members feeling surprised, upset and sidelined as the company removed years’ worth of content and videos they created.\n \n\n   \n  The end of Women Techmakers served as another sign the search giant is unwinding its diversity programs as such initiatives face increasing political pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Google announced an external organization called Technovation will take over the group, but members of Women Techmakers told CNN they feel they have lost an important direct association and pipeline with one of the world’s most influential technology companies.\n \n\n   \n  “The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,” Vassiliki Dalakiari, a former Women Techmakers ambassador and AI research and development manager in Greece, told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.”\n \n\n   \n  Google declined to comment. A person with knowledge of the program said that Google is supporting and providing funding to Technovation through the transition phase and that the company believes in Technovation’s “ability to execute impactful, global programs.”\n \n\n   \n  Technovation CEO Tara Chklovski told CNN that the organization is getting funding from Google “to provide deeper programmatic support” to Women Techmaker members. The group will still have access to events, programs and “technology leaders from multinational companies from around the world (in addition to Google),” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the members say they feel tossed aside by Google after years of building a community many said helped them in their career and personally, as they forged their careers in a male-dominated industry.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Big fat silence’\n \n\n   \n  Women Techmakers  started at Google in 2012  to provide “visibility, community, and resources for women in technology” around the world through trainings, scholarships and event funding, regardless of whether they worked at Google. The most involved and experienced members could become ambassadors and even get funding to help them attend Google developer events.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Google  told employees  that it would no longer set diversity hiring targets and would evaluate its other diversity programs. The company said as a federal contractor, it needed to comply with President Donald Trump’s  executive order  on diversity, equity and inclusion programs for government agencies and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Women Techmakers who spoke to CNN said they started noticing a shift since then.\n \n\n   \n  One member of Women Techmakers based in Asia, who asked to only be identified as Tia, said it became increasingly difficult for ambassadors to get support for events and travel funding.\n \n\n   \n  Dalakiari told CNN that Women Techmakers Ambassadors did not receive the same level of support as they had in the past for the company’s Berlin developers conference over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no travel coverage, no invitation to the community events or meetups. It felt like we were included in name, but not in practice,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in early October, members received short emails, obtained by CNN, informing them that the program would end at Google and shift to Technovation, which started as a youth technology education organization 20 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Technovation says its mission is expanding to include adults and has vowed to maintain Women Techmakers’ mission and approach – as well as access to Google events and programs. But many women in tech said Google’s handling of the news signalled it wanted to quickly distance itself from diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “No global call. No formal announcement. No real explanation… just an email, and a big fat silence since then,” Leyla Damoisaux-Delnoy, a Brussels-based data scientist,  posted  on LinkedIn. “When a company’s commitment to equality ends with an email, it says a lot about what the commitment was really worth.”\n \n\n   \n  Several members CNN spoke to said they were shocked when Women Techmakers YouTube videos and LinkedIn posts were removed without warning. For some members like Yang, that meant vital proof of their work with the global internet juggernaut — like videos of events they led and panels they moderated — suddenly disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Tia said she and other members are feeling “something between devastation and rage.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a global women-in-tech program without informing or engaging its most active contributors sends a clear message and it’s disappointing,” Dalakiari said. “WTM made a real difference, and I’m not sure that decision reflects the values many of us signed up to represent.”\n \n\n   \n    Women in tech programs flailing\n \n\n   \n  Google’s decision to offload oversight of Women Techmakers is just the latest indication that tech giants are scaling back their diversity programs this year.\n \n\n   \n  Tech workers active in programs meant to support women in the field told CNN they have seen a noticeable shift in funding and support in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who studies workplace inequality, said tech firms previously made investments to improve women’s representation after facing scrutiny from gender equality organizations, federal regulators and their own employees.\n \n\n   \n  But things changed in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “The pressure from the federal government is off, and now they actually fear that the Trump administration will come after them if they have any targeted programs,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Internally, more tech companies like Amazon and Meta are  culling their diversity programs .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Dell shut down its Dell Women’s Entrepreneur Network (DWEN). The company told CNN in a statement that the sunsetting of the women’s program coincided with shutting down their “Dell for Startups” program and is part of a “broader internal business strategy shift.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our commitment to empowering small businesses and entrepreneurs and fostering an inclusive workplace and ecosystem remains unwavering,” the company said in part.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Google’s Women Techmakers program told CNN they believe Technovation is a reputable organization with good intentions. But they’re concerned that it won’t have the same funding or impact as a company with the size, resources and recognition of Google.\n \n\n   \n  Still, company culture matters more than dedicated programs when it comes to supporting women and other groups, Tomaskovic-Devey said.\n \n\n   \n  “It probably does not matter much if targeted programs return. What matters is if Google, or any of the other big tech firms, actually manage their workplaces so that everyone feels respected and included,” Tomaskovic-Devey said. “Poor management will lead to backsliding where it really matters, in the diversity, productivity, and creativity of their workforces.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/king-charles-state-visit-vatican-pope-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00+00:00","title":"King Charles Prays with Pope Leo at the Vatican as Prince Andrew Scandal Looms Back Home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III became the first British monarch to engage in a public prayer with a pope in over 500 years during a state visit to the Vatican in October 2025.

It was presided over by Leo and the Church of England’s Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell.\n \n\n   \n  A joint choir from St. George’s Chapel and the Chapel Royal performed at the service, alongside the choir of the Sistine Chapel. The British singers performed “If ye love me,” by Thomas Tallis, a prolific composer of sacred choral works from the Renaissance period\n \n\n   \n  The choice was significant because Tallis’ life spanned the split from Rome precipitated by King Henry VIII. Tallis continued to have a successful career after the Reformation, despite never renouncing his Catholic faith.\n \n\n   \n  The sight of the first joint prayer shared by the King and Pope signals the deepening of bonds between Catholics and Anglicans – a theme of the whistlestop visit.\n \n\n   \n  The King and Queen earlier met the new pontiff for the first time since his May election on Thursday morning, following their arrival in Rome the previous evening to celebrate the holy Jubilee year, which takes place every quarter of a century. They also met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See Secretary of State.\n \n\n   \n  The British monarch gifted the Pope with a large silver photograph, and Icon of St Edward the Confessor, according to Buckingham Palace. In exchange, Leo presented with a scale version of the mosaic of “Christ Pantocrator,” in the Norman Cathedral of Cefalù, in Sicily.\n \n\n   \n  The Vatican described the discussions as “cordial” and “matters of common interest were discussed, such as environmental protection and the fight against poverty.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement added, “Particular attention was given to the shared commitment to promoting peace and security in the face of global challenges.”\n \n\n   \n  The trip is being seen by both sides as a “significant moment” in reconciling divisions between the British monarchy and the papacy that go back to 1534, when Henry VIII broke with Rome and created the Church of England.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be difficult to overstate the significance of this particular visit,” Rev. Martin Browne, a Vatican official who works at the department for “Promoting Christian Unity,” told CNN. He said it was the first time that a royal visit had an “ecumenical dimension,” meaning that it was focused on building unity between Rome, the Church of England and wider Anglican communion.\n \n\n   \n  “A service in which both the pope and a British sovereign participate has not been experienced since long before the Reformation,” Browne explained. “Its uniqueness is underlined by the fact that it is taking place in the Sistine Chapel, inside the Apostolic Palace, with the music being led by the pope’s ‘own’ choir and two of the King’s ‘own’ choirs.”\n \n\n   \n  Later, the King and Queen took part in an ecumenical service at the Basilica of St. Paul’s Outside the Walls, which has historic ties to the English Crown and is home to the tomb of the apostle St. Paul, for which past British monarchs paid the upkeep. It is one of the four papal basilicas in Rome and also houses a community of Benedictine monks.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo has approved making King Charles a “Royal Confrater” of St. Paul’s, as a “gesture of hospitality and spiritual fellowship.” In celebration of this new bond, a special throne-like chair has been commissioned by the place of worship, featuring the King’s coat of arms and the Latin motto “Ut unum sint” (“That they may be one”). It will remain permanently in the basilica for use by his successors.\n \n\n   \n  The pope is also making the King and Queen a knight and dame of the order of Pius IX. Charles has himself decided to honor Pope Leo by making him a “Papal Confrater of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle” and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, an honor traditionally given to heads of state.\n \n\n   \n  The state visit concluded with King Charles attending a reception at the Pontifical Beda College, a seminary which trains priests from across the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, Queen Camilla met six Catholic sisters from the International Union of Superiors General, who work to support female empowerment around the world, including through girls’ education.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the turbulence of the past, relations between the Vatican and the British monarchy are today marked by warmth and mutual respect. The UK and the Holy See have had full diplomatic relations since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Charles and Camilla were supposed to pay a state visit to the Vatican in early April, but the trip was postponed over Pope Francis’ poor health. They continued with an official visit to Italy, visiting Rome and Ravenna in the northeast. But the royal couple were able to privately visit the ailing pontiff a fortnight before he died.\n \n\n   \n  As Prince of Wales, Charles visited Vatican City on five occasions, while his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, met five popes during her lifetime.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, there are differences and divisions, some of them very deep,” Browne said. “But this (visit) is a reminder for everyone that what unites is more significant.”\n \n\n   \n  Diarmaid MacCulloch, a church historian from the University of Oxford, said that while there had been some ill-informed “hype” around the King’s visit, “there is some genuine significance in the Papacy showing such formal favor” to Charles.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a nice goodwill gesture on the Vatican’s part, and goodwill gestures are always welcome,” MacCulloch said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/climate/atlantic-tropical-storm-melissa-movement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Moves Slowly, Raises Flood and Climate Concerns","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa is moving at an extremely slow pace through the Caribbean, covering only about 2 miles per hour, which is slower than a person’s walking speed.

can walk faster than Tropical Storm Melissa is moving. It’s a new, troubling tendency for Atlantic storms \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:45 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Tropical Storm Melissa  is expected to meander the Caribbean at an agonizingly slow pace in the coming days, even as it’s forecast to strengthen into a hurricane, covering as little as 2 miles in an hour. This is slower than an average person’s walking speed.\n \n\n   \n  Hurricanes are powerful storms, but they require a tug or pull from other weather systems, such as a cold front or a dip in the jet stream, to determine how fast they move and where they go.\n \n\n   \n  When those influences are very weak or absent, however — as is the case with Melissa — a storm can meander for days, dumping torrential amounts of rainfall on anyone unlucky enough to be nearby.\n \n\n   \n  Slow movement and weak upper-level winds can also help a storm like Melissa intensify into a major hurricane — Category 3 or stronger. Right now, the Caribbean Sea has some of the most unusually hot waters of any part of the Atlantic Ocean, and the storm could have the opportunity to tap into that energy.\n \n\n   \n  “The potential intensity is quite elevated in the Caribbean, compared to the 1979-2023 average for this time of year,” said Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist specializing in tropical cyclones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There has not been much storm activity in the Caribbean so far this year due to strong upper-level winds that have inhibited nascent storms from intensifying, he pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  But now, conditions are expected to be primed for Tropical Storm Melissa to keep at its snail’s pace.\n \n\n   \n    Are hurricanes slowing down?\n \n\n   \n  There is evidence that slow-moving tropical storms and hurricanes are occurring more frequently in the Atlantic Basin, particularly near and over land masses, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  Studies in the past several years have showed a slow-down in forward speed at landfall. That’s a critical change, since a slower-moving storm typically means more flooding rainfall, and potentially more storm surge.\n \n\n   \n  Some research has pointed to global warming as a potential cause of this trend, but this is not yet fully established, said meteorologist Kieran Bhatia of the global risk and reinsurance company Guy Carpenter.\n \n\n   \n  Some studies, Bhatia said, show tropical storms and hurricanes have slowed down in recent years over the continental United States and near-coastal US   regions as well.\n \n\n   \n  However, “these observed changes have not yet been confidently linked” to human-caused climate change, he said. The most recent major report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found a trend that is not explainable solely by natural variability with “medium” confidence, Bhatia said.\n \n\n   \n  Research from hurricane expert James Kossin and his colleagues have in fact pointed to  global slowdowns in tropical cyclone forward speeds . They found this trend was related to changes in upper-level air circulation that are consistent with expectations from global warming.\n \n\n   \n  Other work from Kossin, a former scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who teaches at the University of Wisconsin, stands out for showing a trend toward slower-moving or even stalling North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes  at or near landfall .\n \n\n   \n   Additional research by other scientists  provides further evidence of recent slowdowns in the forward movement of tropical cyclones, while some  modeling studies project  that future climate change is likely to result in more meandering storms.\n \n\n   \n  But the broader community of meteorologists and climate scientists are not yet fully in agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of any climate change ties, any tendency to slow down, like the crawling forward speed of Tropical Storm Melissa, has huge implications for impacts because it allows such storms to dump heavier rainfall totals over land.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa, for example, poses a major flooding threat to Jamaica and Hispaniola in particular, due to its extended proximity to land, the presence of tall mountains that tend to wring out moisture from the atmosphere and the likelihood that heavy rains will fall for many consecutive days.\n \n\n   \n  While the tie between slower-moving storms and climate change is a topic of active research, studies have conclusively shown tropical storms and hurricanes now produce more rainfall than they used to. This is due to warming ocean and air temperatures, since warmer air holds more moisture.\n \n\n   \n  A devastating example of a slow-moving, water-laden storm was Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which produced 60.58 inches of rain in southeastern Texas. This was the highest rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in US history.\n \n\n   \n  As storms slow down, there is potential for more hurricanes to be like Harvey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/baseball-mlb-seattle-mariners-defeat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"It’s a failure: Seattle Mariners feel the deep pain of disappointment after narrowly missing out on first World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Seattle Mariners narrowly lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in a dramatic Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, falling 4-3 and remaining the only Major League Baseball team to never reach the World Series.

Mariners , the wait goes on.\n \n\n   \n  One game away from reaching a first World Series in franchise history, Seattle fell heartbreakingly short in Monday’s 4-3  defeat  against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n \n\n   \n  The gut-wrenching loss ensures that the Mariners’ unwanted record as the only team in Major League Baseball never to appear at the Fall Classic remains very much intact.\n \n\n   \n  To see how much this moment pained Seattle and its players, look no further than MVP candidate  Cal Raleigh , who was reduced to tears at the end of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I love every guy in this room, but ultimately, it’s not what we wanted,” Raleigh told reporters after the game. “I hate to use the word failure, but it’s a failure.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what we expected: to get to the World Series and win a World Series. That’s what the bar is and the standard is – that’s what we want to hold ourselves accountable to – but it hurts.”\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh was far from alone in his pain. “We’ve put in so much work and effort through this whole year and it’s over,” said Seattle center fielder Julio Rodríguez. “That’s also part of the game too.”\n \n\n   \n  The disappointment is also felt strongly among the team’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “As someone who’s a Seattle transplant, I don’t quite have the decades of embedded angst that some locals may carry with them,” Mariners fan Gabe Guarente, 48, told  CNN Sports . “But I do sort of share their fatalistic view of the team. We don’t really expect good things to happen, so when they do, it’s more of a pleasant surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s why this year’s ALCS Game 7 loss felt both inevitable and completely heartbreaking at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  Guarente described his emotions after the defeat as “gloomy … with an undercurrent of simmering rage at the cruel baseball gods.”\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions during this year’s American League Championship Series (ALCS), the signs looked so promising for the Mariners. They jumped into a 2-0 series lead, then went 3-2 up after victory in Game 5.\n \n\n   \n  And in the winner-takes-all game at Toronto’s Rodgers Centre, Seattle went 3-1 ahead when Raleigh launched his fifth home run of the postseason and fourth against the Blue Jays, putting his team in control of the contest at the top of the fifth.\n \n\n   \n  That, however, would be the high point of a miserable night for the Mariners. George Springer’s three-run homer saw Toronto move ahead in the seventh inning, and with that, Seattle’s hopes evaporated.\n \n\n   \n  Having never in their 49-season history been so close to appearing at the World Series, right now, it might feel like the Mariners have never been further away.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a lot of anger and some tears from my friends and other fans afterward,” Mariners supporter Joseph Leavitt, 30, told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  In time, fans will be able to reflect on the team’s successful year, reaching a first ALCS since 2001 with a thrilling, near-five-hour win over the Detroit Tigers.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-year-old Raleigh has been the heartbeat of this Seattle team, hitting an MLB-leading 60 home runs in the regular season, only the seventh player in history to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  He signed a reported six-year, $105 million contract extension back in March, while Rodríguez is also locked into a long-term contract through 2029.\n \n\n   \n  For the Mariners – just the fourth team to lead a best-of-seven series 2-0 in the postseason and not advance – the ambition of reaching a first-ever World Series is still there, even in the post-mortem of a brutal loss.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us now have had a taste of how close we can get and how good this team can be,” said manager Dan Wilson. “Once you get that, that’s what you’re shooting for the next year and I know that will continue to be the goal … to get to that final step.\n \n\n   \n  “This year, we were one game short.”\n \n\n   \n  Fans like Guarente are cautiously optimistic about the future, given the talent and age profile of the Seattle team.\n \n\n   \n  “If they invest even a little bit in free agency, I think they can get back in this position,” he said. “It helps that the AL West is not a juggernaut, and the Astros’ empire is on the decline.\n \n\n   \n  “So, yes, I do think the Mariners can reach the World Series in the near future. They’ll have to get more of that  Humpy The Salmon  magic back, though.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt, meanwhile, calls the season a “massive success” overall, adding: “I would say sting of disappointment still lingers, but there is a lot of optimism about this current roster.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/business/elon-musk-pay-package-tesla","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Elon Musk says he needs $1 trillion to stop 'corporate terrorists' from wresting control of Tesla","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and primary owner of AI company xAI, has announced that he needs a $1 trillion pay package to maintain control of Tesla and protect it from what he calls 'corporate terrorists'—specifically the shareholder advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis.

\n   \n  Elon Musk says he needs to build his stake in Tesla so much that he could become the world’s first trillionaire. But this week he said his aim wasn’t to increase his planet-leading wealth. Instead, Musk said the biggest pay package in history was necessary to protect his company.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk said on a call with investors Wednesday. “There needs to be enough voting control to give (me) a strong influence – but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.”\n \n\n   \n  Musk said he needs to protect Tesla from two influential (but hardly all-powerful) research firms that advise shareholders how to vote – ISS and Glass Lewis, which he described as “corporate terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and …then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” he said. “They have made many terrible recommendations in the past that if those recommendations had been followed, it would have been extremely destructive to the future of the company.”\n \n\n   \n  Musk claimed that passive index funds that control much of Tesla’s shares blindly follow the recommendations of ISS and Glass Lewis. But shareholder votes have always followed Tesla’s board recommendations. Although shareholders have voted against other companies’ board recommendations, they’re quite rare.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Glass Lewis and ISS recommended votes against a previous massive pay package for Musk. But shareholders approved that package in 2018 with 73% of shares held by investors other than Musk and his brother. After a Delaware judge threw out that pay package ruling it wasn’t in the interest of shareholders, Tesla held another vote and that time it was approved by holders of 84% of the shares.\n \n\n   \n  The two firms have reportedly recommended a vote against Musk’s newest pay package as well. Neither firm responded to a request for comment early Thursday about Musk referring them as terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  Musk now owns 413 million shares of Tesla outright and had options to buy 304 million additional shares at a small fraction of current prices, but those options have been struck down twice by the Delaware judge. The Delaware Supreme Court heard arguments in that case earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  The 413 million shares he owns and 96 million conditional additional shares that Tesla has agreed to give him in case the Delaware court decision is upheld would give him about 16% of the company’s outstanding shares. Musk has repeatedly said he wants roughly 10% more of the company.\n \n\n   \n  The pay package now up for a vote could give him options to buy 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock.\n \n\n   \n  But Musk would get those shares only if the value of Tesla stock increases significantly in coming years. The options would be worth close to $1 trillion should the company hit the increased valuation targets laid out in the package.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla’s board said the package is needed keep him focused on Tesla given all his other holdings and interests. He is also CEO of SpaceX and the primary owner of AI company, xAI, which owns social media platform X that he bought when it was Twitter, and several other companies.\n \n\n   \n  “Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence,” said the company’s proxy proposing the package. “Simply put, retaining and incentivizing Elon is fundamental to Tesla achieving these goals and becoming the most valuable company in history.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/northern-ireland-bloody-sunday-trial-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Northern Ireland court finds soldier not guilty of murder over Bloody Sunday killings","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Belfast court found a British soldier, known as Soldier F, not guilty of murder in connection with the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Londonderry, marking the first and only trial of a member of the British armed forces over the incident.

gets tough on Moscow, has Putin’s strategy of playing Trump run its course? \n       \n  Analysis by Matthew Chance, CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Kremlin may have convinced itself that US President Donald Trump didn’t have the stomach to apply real pressure on Moscow to end the  brutal conflict in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  It was, after all, just a carefully timed Kremlin phone call to the White House last week that convinced the US president to back away from his own threats of providing long-range  Tomahawk missiles  to Kyiv, missiles that could have made a real difference on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  But the  new US Treasury sanctions  on Russia’s two biggest oil companies may now force the Kremlin strongman, Vladimir Putin, to finally reassess his American counterpart, if not his Ukrainian war.\n \n\n   \n  Already an outspoken Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, has slammed Trump as “the talkative peacemaker who has now fully embarked on the war path against Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is his conflict now, not the senile Biden’s,” Medvedev added in a social media post, referring provocatively to the former US president.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not that the sanctions themselves are particularly tough. True, oil is essential to the Russian economy, funding the Kremlin’s costly war in Ukraine. It’s also true that Rosneft and Lukoil, sanctioned along with dozens of their subsidiaries, are Russia’s most significant oil producers.\n \n\n   \n  But Russia, one of the world’s most sanctioned countries, has proven adept at finding ways of circumventing these kinds of punitive measures in the past. It will, according to senior Russian officials, seek to do so again.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision will not pose any particular problems for us. Our country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to confidently develop its economic and energy potential,” said Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, in a televised press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The bigger problem for the Kremlin is that its favorite and well-tested strategy to manipulate the Trump White House – holding out the prospect of engagement on peace in Ukraine and dangling lucrative economic deals, while pressing ahead with its relentless military onslaught – appears to have run its course.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, the US president, who has  for months suspected  the Kremlin may be simply “tapping (him) along” on Ukraine, has decided to act.\n \n\n   \n  As well as imposing his first proper sanctions on Russia since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump also “canceled” a  proposed summit  with Putin in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  Just hours before, Russian officials – relishing the chance of another face-to-face presidential meeting – insisted there were “no obstacles” and that arrangements were actively being made, dismissing any suggestions of the summit being shelved.\n \n\n   \n  But, in retrospect, that optimism appears to have been Kremlin wishful thinking too. Putin is, of course, extremely keen to show Russians and the wider world that – despite sanctions and an indictment for war crimes at the  International Criminal Court  – that he is far from isolated on the international stage.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump rolled out the red carpet for him in Alaska this August, the leader of the world’s most powerful nation standing  shoulder to shoulder  with the Kremlin boss, it was an easy diplomatic win for the Kremlin, which offered little to the White House in return.\n \n\n   \n  There will, apparently, be no repeat performance in Budapest unless and until progress is made on Ukraine. The US Treasury has even suggested that more powerful American sanctions on Russia could follow, to further pressure the Kremlin into quickly talking peace.\n \n\n   \n  It could be the start of what critics of Trump’s handling of the Kremlin have long been calling for: a tough, new strategy to finally use considerable US leverage to try and force Putin to compromise on his maximalist war objectives.\n \n\n   \n  These include Kremlin demands for Kyiv to surrender strategic swathes of territory in  the Donbas , in eastern Ukraine, which Russia has so far been unable to conquer –  a red line  for the Ukrainian government and its European backers.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has described the US moves as “very important” and crucial to “bring Russia to the negotiating table.” Meanwhile, European officials have also expressed satisfaction with Washington’s apparently more hardline stance.\n \n\n   \n  But after nine months trapped on the rollercoaster ride of this latest Trump presidency, there are ever-present anxieties. And behind the scenes in Kyiv, in Brussels and even in Moscow, few doubt that in the erratic, mercurial world of Trump, a sudden switch back to the Kremlin’s point of view could be just another friendly, carefully-timed phone call with Putin away.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/entertainment/kristen-bell-anniversary-post","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Kristen Bell's Anniversary Joke Sparks Domestic Violence Backlash Amid 'Nobody Wants This' Season Return","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kristen Bell sparked a public controversy by posting a lighthearted anniversary message referencing a joke from her husband Dax Shepard about never killing her, which many viewed as tone-deaf and potentially trivializing domestic violence.

October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Jennifer Lawrence walked the red carpet at the Rome Film Festival this week, she did so while wearing a two-toned V-neck sweater and a lightweight tiered white skirt. Her cozy knit pullover was weather-appropriate for a fall October evening, but formal wear puritans might question whether it was red carpet-appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  Sweaters are not often associated with glamorous event arrivals, at least not in recent memory. For the last 15 or so years, celebrities have been, in general, more trussed up, as red carpets have become a heightened economic prospective for stars and designers alike. These days, it’s not unusual for  an ornate gown to come with a sculptural headpiece , or be completed by a train that reaches beyond several meters. Earlier this year the Cannes Film Festival organizers even went as far as banning “voluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train,” in their red carpet dress code after the “flow of traffic of guests” was being disrupted by too many larger-than-life frocks. Of course,  no one really listened .\n \n\n   \n  Lawrence’s ensemble still fit the bill (it was from Jonathan Anderson’s debut womenswear collection for Dior, after all). But it still ran counter to the impulse to do the  most , refusing the popular strategy of wearing the biggest, boldest gown — or, lately, the most transparent dress. There’s a reason nostalgic photos of 1990s film premieres are constantly recirculated on the internet: Red carpets looked more fun three decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  In a world before stylists and social media, celebrities had room to dress according to their mood and personal taste — not to mention the freedom to experiment away from the pitchforks of an Instagram comment section. Despite Lawrence’s outfit being straight from the runway, her easy-breezy, slouchy sweater called back to another era of Hollywood dressing. It also seemed to ask: Can red carpet fashion loosen up a bit?\n \n\n   \n  Lawrence’s style choices have posed that question before, for example when she paired a Dior red princess gown with a pair of  black flip flops  at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023. But she isn’t the only one challenging expectations. Last month, comedian and actor Megan Stalter made headlines for defying red carpet tradition by wearing a pair of blue Levi’s jeans and a white T-shirt to the 2025 Emmys.\n \n\n   \n  “I think people need to bring back jeans on the red carpet,” Stalter told Variety. “They were in the ‘90s… there’s no rules. You’re allowed to do what you want.”\n \n\n   \n  There have been other rumblings of a red carpet resistance: Taylor Russell dressed in vintage Levi’s and a Gucci white fur bolero for the Fashion Awards in 2022, and Kristen Stewart’s sweater dress (albeit sequinned and Chanel) at the Toronto Film Festival in 2018. But A-listers looking to really disrupt the sartorial status quo must make bigger statements — by being decidedly more understated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/basketball-nba-wednesday-review-wembanyama-flagg-edgecombe-intl","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":""},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/federal-worker-pay-bill-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00Z","title":"","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":""},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/graham-platner-maine-senate-controversy","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-04:00","title":"","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":""},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Takeaways from the second general election debate in the NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the second and final general election debate for New York City mayor, Democrat Zohran Mamdani faced sharp criticism from independent Andrew Cuomo, who accused him of lacking experience and qualifications to lead the city.

Cuomo called Mamdani divisive and said he lacked experience or new ideas, while Mamdani said the former governor, down in the polls, was a “desperate man lashing out.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo was looking for a moment to change the race’s contours less than two weeks from Election Day while Mamdani both sought to lock in his lead and establish himself  as winning the “battle over the soul” of the national Democratic Party . The two tore into each other in strikingly personal terms on their backgrounds, their policy ideas and how each would address antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  Republican nominee  Curtis Sliwa , meanwhile, reprised his wildcard role as he refuses to bow to a pressure campaign from some in his party to leave the race.\n \n\n   \n  Here are key moments from the debate:\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo gives Mamdani a dressing-down about experience\n \n\n   \n  In a pivot from his frequent reference to his time in government, Cuomo sought to put distance between his record as governor and New York City’s municipal failures. Notably for someone elected governor three times, Cuomo argued that “the city has been getting screwed by the state, and that has to change.”\n \n\n   \n  But the exchange gave Mamdani an opening to attack Cuomo for his record as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “The governor doesn’t build housing in New York City,” Cuomo said in response to a question on housing policy.\n \n\n   \n  “Not if it’s you,” Mamdani retorted.\n \n\n   \n  That led to Cuomo accusing Mamdani of never having “accomplished anything.”\n \n\n   \n  “I did things; you have never had a job,” Cuomo said motioning towards Mamdani and drawing applause from the crowd. “There is no reason to believe you have any merit or qualification for 8.5 million lives. You don’t know how to run a government.”\n \n\n   \n  He went on to paint Mamdani as an inexperienced legislator who is unprepared to lead America’s biggest city and would be dangerous in the event of an emergency.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know how to handle an emergency, and you literally never proposed a bill on anything that you’re not talking about in your campaign,” Cuomo said, his voice rising.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Mamdani accused Cuomo of creating “his own facts.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just had a former governor say in his own words that the city has been getting screwed by the state,” Mamdani said. “Who was leading the state? It was you. You were leading the state … screwing the city.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani tears into Cuomo’s experience argument\n \n\n   \n  “You will hear from Andrew Cuomo about his experience as if the issue is that we don’t know about it,” Mamdani said at one point. “The issue is that we have all experienced your experience.”\n \n\n   \n  To underscore that argument, Mamdani’s campaign invited to the debate Charlotte Bennett, a former aide in Cuomo’s administration who  accused him of sexual harassment  in 2021. Cuomo resigned from office under the cloud of that investigation though he has denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Given a chance to question Cuomo, Mamdani raised the sexual harassment cases.\n \n\n   \n  “You sought to access her private gynecological records,” Mamdani said. “She cannot speak up for herself because you lodged a defamation case against her. I, however, can speak. What do you say to the 13 women that you sexually harassed?”\n \n\n   \n  The question drew applause from Mamdani supporters in the audience. Cuomo responded at first by suggesting Mamdani was being unserious and immature. He then launched into his defense, saying five district attorneys declined to pursue the cases and that he has not been found criminally or civilly liable.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo then turned to Mamdani to attack him for appearing in a picture with a Ugandan politician known for her anti-LGBTQ positions.\n \n\n   \n   “Had I known that the first deputy minister was the architect of that legislation, I would not have taken that photo,” Mamdani said. “I also know that this constant attempt to smear and slander me is an attempt to also distract from the fact that, unlike myself, you do not actually have a platform or set of policies to protect those same New Yorkers here.”\n \n\n   \n    The three candidates talk about ICE and Trump\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids in New York City emerged as a flashpoint early in the debate, as all three candidates rejected the federal crackdown and argued over who was best able to deal with President Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo said that “we don’t need ICE to do quality-of-life crimes,” after a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement  raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street  in Manhattan Tuesday. Mamdani argued the agency “cares little for the law and even less for the people that they’re supposed to serve.” And Sliwa agreed that “the feds should not have stepped into this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  But the candidates diverged sharply on how they’d approach Trump. Cuomo said that “you’re going to have to confront” him while Sliwa suggested that “you can’t beat Trump, he holds most of the cards,” saying that “you have to try to negotiate.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, meanwhile, said that he was open to working with Trump on lowering the cost of living but pivoted to attacking Cuomo, saying that Trump “wants Andrew Cuomo to be the mayor, not because it will be good for New Yorkers, but because it will be good for him.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo shot back that Trump would take advantage of Mamdani’s youth and inexperience to press his crackdown on the city.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump, I believe, wants Mamdani. That is his dream, because he will use him politically all across the country, and he will take over New York City. Make no mistake, it will be President Trump and Mayor Trump, and he will come in and take over the city,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Then he worked in a bit of Yiddish.\n \n\n   \n  “He has no respect for him,” Cuomo said. “He thinks he’s a kid and he’s going to knock him on his tuchus.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani’s rivals gang up on him about ballot measures\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo and Sliwa briefly ganged up on Mamdani over his refusal to take a position on a set of controversial ballot measures New Yorkers will weigh in this election year.\n \n\n   \n  At one point, holding his hands up in the air and swaying side to side as if to mock Mamdani for talking too much, Cuomo attacked Mamdani for not having yet made his position clear.\n \n\n   \n  “What a political answer. What is your opinion, Zohran?” Sliwa demanded.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes or no?” Cuomo joined in.\n \n\n   \n  “I think on this stage, you can see two people appealing for the Republican Party’s votes,” Mamdani chimed in over the crosstalk. Pressed to answer, he conceded, “I have not yet taken a position on those ballot amendments.”\n \n\n   \n  There are six ballot proposals covering a range of topics, including significant housing reform, a change to election years and the construction of a sports complex on forest land.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani sends a clear signal about policing\n \n\n   \n  For months, Mamdani has said  he would consider keeping New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch  if elected but has stopped short of committing to asking her to stay on.\n \n\n   \n  That changed Wednesday. Just before the debate began, two people familiar with the plan confirmed to CNN that Mamdani intends to ask Tisch to stay on the job if he is elected mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s decision,  first reported  by The New York Times, signals his attempt to moderate as the general election nears and he continues to face criticism, especially on his previous critiques of the police.\n \n\n   \n  “I can confirm that reporting,” Mamdani said on the debate stage.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has walked back previous calls to defund the police and has apologized to officers for referring to them as “racist” and “wicked” in social media posts.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear if Tisch, who is highly regarded in the city’s political circles, would stay on even if asked.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo and Sliwa also said they would ask Tisch to stay on as commissioner.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani faces criticism about antisemitism\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani  again addressed Jewish voters  who are concerned about his criticisms of Israel and question his commitment to fighting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  “I look forward to being a mayor for every single person that calls the city home,” he said, adding: “All 8.5 million New Yorkers, and that includes Jewish New Yorkers who may have concerns or opposition to the positions that I’ve shared about Israel and Palestine.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s opponents, however, expressed skepticism and accused him of promoting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re the savior of the Jewish people? You won’t denounce ‘Globalize the Intifada,’ which means ‘Kill Jews,’” Cuomo said, referencing the controversial phrase that  Mamdani has discouraged using  and noting that hundreds of rabbis had signed a letter criticizing him. “There’s unprecedented fear in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa made a personal appeal to Mamdani, referencing his own Jewish family members, saying that members of the community were “scared.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me speak on behalf of my two sons when they’ve heard some of the statements you’ve made,” Sliwa said. “They view you as the arsonist who fans the flames of antisemitism. They cannot suddenly accept the fact that you’re coming in like a firefighter and you’re going to put out these flames. You’ve got a lot of explaining to do, a lot of apologizing to do.”\n \n\n   \n  He also alleged that Mamdani, who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor, had praised “global jihad.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani responded that “there is room for disagreement on many positions and many policies.” But he also pushed back.\n \n\n   \n  “I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said and that continues to be ascribed to me,” he said. “And frankly, I think much of it has to do with the fact that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election.”\n \n\n   \n    Sliwa goes after Cuomo; Cuomo fires back\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s allies have pressured Sliwa to drop out of the race so the former governor can consolidate opposition to Mamdani. Sliwa has rejected that push with his characteristic bluntness and color, referencing the movie “Braveheart” earlier Wednesday in  suggesting he would choose death  over working for a Cuomo mayoral administration.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa challenged Cuomo repeatedly, including on the sexual misconduct allegations that led him to resign as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “The only reason that Zohran is on this stage is because of the failed Gov. Cuomo, who was rejected by the Democrats in the primary and rejected by 13 women who charged you with sexual harassment,” Sliwa said. “Do you ever know that no means no? Do you know what no means, Cuomo?”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo responded by accusing Sliwa of tax fraud, claiming that he’d failed to properly disclose donations to his crime prevention organization, the Guardian Angels. “So I think that’s the person who has explaining to do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At another point, Sliwa accused Cuomo of cutting funding for hospital beds for people with mental illnesses, ending his point with “Shame on you!”\n \n\n   \n  Retorted Cuomo: “There’s one bed I’m going to save for you.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/health/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"COVID-19 Vaccines May Help Some Cancer Patients Fight Tumors","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A study from MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Florida found that patients with advanced lung or skin cancer who received a Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors lived substantially longer.

Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines,  cutting $500 million in funding  for some uses of the technology.\n \n\n   \n  But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.\n \n\n   \n  A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack.  Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak . It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.\n \n\n   \n  Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the  Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines , scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.\n \n\n   \n  The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”\n \n\n   \n  Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.\n \n\n   \n  Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.\n \n\n   \n  So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.\n \n\n   \n  Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/football-nfl-week-8-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"A revenge game, Ravens’ season on the line and a big bye week: 5 things to know about Week 8 of the NFL season","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Week 8 of the 2025 NFL season, six teams — including the Rams, Seahawks, Cardinals, Lions, Raiders, and Jaguars — have a bye week, making it the largest bye week in the season and increasing pressure on others.

about Week 8 of the NFL season \n       \n  By Andy Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  NFL  season’s getting real in Week 8.\n \n\n   \n  A legend faces his former team, bye weeks are piling up and teams are one loss away from trading playbooks for tickets to Cancun.\n \n\n   \n  Here are five things to know about Week 8.\n \n\n   \n    Big bye week bonanza\n \n\n   \n  Week 8 is the biggest bye week of the season – six teams are taking the week off, and fantasy football managers everywhere are feeling the pain.\n \n\n   \n  The Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks, Arizona Cardinals, Detroit Lions, Las Vegas Raiders and Jacksonville Jaguars are all off, leaving just 13 games on the slate. That’s three of the four NFC West teams resting, with only the San Francisco 49ers still in action.\n \n\n   \n  It’s officially “scramble to the waiver wire” season. If you’re starting multiple tight ends owned in only 20% of leagues this week, don’t worry – you are not alone.\n \n\n   \n    The Texans’ offense: So bad, it’s historic\n \n\n   \n  Houston’s defense has been lights out – their offense, eh, not so much. The Texans have allowed the fewest points in the league yet sit at 2-4.\n \n\n   \n  They’re the first team in  NFL  history to lead the league in fewest points allowed and still have a losing record through seven weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The good news? They face a 49ers defense that’s really banged up and can’t seem to catch the ball. San Francisco hasn’t intercepted a pass in 14 straight games – the longest drought since 1950. The only other team without a pick this season: the winless New York Jets.\n \n\n   \n  So maybe, just maybe, this is the week the Texans’ offense finally wakes up.\n \n\n   \n    Rodgers’ ‘Revenge’ (sort of)\n \n\n   \n  For the first time in his career, Aaron Rodgers will face his old team – the Green Bay Packers. And this time, he’s doing it as the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers spent 18 seasons in Green Bay, winning a Super Bowl, four regular season MVPs and becoming a franchise legend. Now, at 41, he’ll look across the field at the team that defined his career.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers insists it’s not a revenge game, saying he still has “a lot of love” for the organization – but don’t be surprised if he saves a little extra magic for Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers is currently fourth in the league with 14 touchdown passes, proving the man still has plenty left in the tank.\n \n\n   \n    The Broncos’ Mile-High Miracle\n \n\n   \n  The Denver Broncos pulled off one of the wildest comebacks in NFL history last Sunday. Down 18 points to the  New York Giants  with less than six minutes left, Denver erupted for 33 fourth-quarter points to somehow win.\n \n\n   \n  Before that, teams trailing by 18 or more with under six minutes remaining had lost 1,602 straight games. That streak – gone. Giants fans may never emotionally recover.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Denver gets the Dallas Cowboys at home, as they look to keep the magic going and stay atop the AFC West.\n \n\n   \n    Ravens’ season on the brink\n \n\n   \n  It’s not officially a playoff game, but it might as well be.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens host the Chicago Bears in what feels like a must-win for a 1-5 Baltimore squad that’s been wrecked by injuries. Only four teams in NFL history have started 1-5 and still made the playoffs – the last being the 2020 Washington Football Team.\n \n\n   \n  The silver lining: Lamar Jackson is expected to return from his hamstring injury, just in time to face a red-hot Bears team that’s won four straight for the first time in seven years.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s offense under head coach Ben Johnson has been rolling – they’re the only team in the NFL to score 21 or more in every game this season.\n \n\n   \n  For Baltimore, the margin for error is gone. It’s win now… or start thinking about next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/trump-argentina-beef-deal-farmer-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s Argentina beef deal angers America’s struggling farmers: ‘You’re selling us out’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has faced criticism from U.S. cattle ranchers and soybean farmers over his proposal to significantly increase low-tariff beef imports from Argentina—raising the annual quota from 20,000 to 80,000 metric tons.

America’s struggling farmers: ‘You’re selling us out’ \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said this week he “loved” America’s cattle ranchers. But those farmers, who overwhelmingly supported the president in the 2024 election, say they aren’t feeling the love right now.\n \n\n   \n   Trump is facing criticism  from many US cattle ranchers after signaling support for increasing low-tariff beef imports from Argentina to ease record beef prices in the United States. The move comes just weeks after US soybean farmers blasted a separate deal with Argentina that they fear will give South American producers a competitive edge in that market.\n \n\n   \n  Argentina currently accounts for just over 2% of US beef imports. Under existing rules, it can ship up to 20,000 metric tons a year at a lower tariff rate, with anything above that subject to a 26.4% tariff, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN the administration plans to raise that quota to 80,000 metric tons, effectively quadrupling the amount of Argentinian beef with low tariffs that can enter the United States.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said: “Currently, Americans consume 12 million metric tons of beef. 10 million, we produce in this country. 2 million, we import. Out of 12 million, [the Argentine quota] would be 20,000 every quarter. This is not a massive influx in the millions of tons I think that some have thought of beef from Argentina.”\n \n\n   \n  But Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle farmer and the senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan farm organization, said: “If Trump goes through with what he outlined, I do believe it’s a betrayal of the American rancher. It’s a feeling that you’re selling us out to a foreign competitor.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump reacted to the backlash from cattle ranchers.\n \n\n   \n  “The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil,” Trump wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade association for beef producers, said the organization and its members “cannot stand behind the President while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers by importing Argentinian beef in an attempt to influence prices.”\n \n\n   \n    Why beef prices are at record highs\n \n\n   \n  The price of beef  has climbed significantly this year , up nearly 14% in the past year, according to the latest inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August. (A fresh read on consumer prices is set to be released Friday.)\n \n\n   \n  Becca Jablonski, an agricultural economist who teaches at Cornell University’s Johnson School of Business, said the price increase is fueled by multiple factors.\n \n\n   \n  A recent, multi-year drought decreased the amount of grazing land for cattle and made feed grain significantly more expensive, resulting in a shortage of cattle, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage has also been made worse by an infestation of New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, just across the border in Mexico, significantly curtailing beef imports from that country.\n \n\n   \n  Jablonski said that historically the livestock sector barely makes money, but is having a rare positive year, which allows farmers to pay down debts they accrued during unprofitable years.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the argument the industry is making is, ‘Let us have one good year,’” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the president is keeping his promises to defend farmers and consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump pledged to protect America’s ranchers and deliver economic relief for everyday Americans. The Administration is accomplishing both by expanding beef imports from Argentina to lower consumer prices in the short term while rolling out a new USDA initiative that will support ranchers and expand cattle herd sizes to keep prices lower in the long term,” Kelly said.\n \n\n   \n  Lovell said many of the farmers he knows are just scraping by.\n \n\n   \n  “It is not uncommon for folks in farming to have a year where they report a loss,” he said. “You cannot look at cattle producers that had one good year and say, ‘Oh my gosh, they are just making out like bandits.’”\n \n\n   \n  Lovell blamed price increases on the large meatpacking corporations that buy product from US ranchers and package it for grocery stores.\n \n\n   \n  An influx of imported beef would hurt US farmers, he said, because the large meat packers are not required to label what country their beef comes from.\n \n\n   \n    Soybean farmers reeling from tariff spat\n \n\n   \n  There are some signs that support for Trump in farm country has begun to fray. He won 93% of rural counties in the 2024 election, the highest share of any Republican presidential candidate this century,  according  to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan research organization.\n \n\n   \n  But soybean farmers were among  the first to feel the pain  of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs with China. Since May, China has effectively boycotted American soybeans as a response to Trump’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Even before tariffs, the family farming industry in the United States was already hurting. Since 2017, the country has lost more than 17% of its family farms — at least 100,000 operations — according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs may be exacerbating that pain. Farm bankruptcies  rose in the first half of the year  to the highest level since 2021, according to US courts data.\n \n\n   \n  John Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer and the founder of The National Black Farmers Association, said he had never had a problem selling his soybeans until recently.\n \n\n   \n  “Now nobody’s buying it,” Boyd said. “The largest purchaser of our soybeans was China, and they haven’t placed any orders. Zero.”\n \n\n   \n  “The president thinks his tariffs are the best thing since sliced bread, and it’s putting America’s farmers out of business,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The administration drew backlash last month after agreeing to provide $20 billion in currency support to help stabilize the Argentine peso, a move critics have characterized as effectively bailing out Argentina.\n \n\n   \n   A text message, seen by CNN , sent by Secretary Rollins to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggested that Argentina then used that financial lifeline to strike a deal with China on soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  “We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return the Argentine’s (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,” the message said.\n \n\n   \n  “Here we are losing our farms, and the president is helping out a foreign country,” Boyd said of the deal.\n \n\n   \n    USDA steps in\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  sources told CNN  the White House was planning to extend a multibillion-dollar bailout for farmers. With the government shutdown stretching past its third week, no plan has materialized yet.\n \n\n   \n  Although the USDA has been largely shuttered during the government shutdown, the agency on Wednesday  announced  a plan it said would “strengthen the American beef industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan includes expanding ranchers’ access to federal land for grazing and prioritizing grant applications from military veterans looking to enter the industry, among other measures.\n \n\n   \n  Lovell said that while the plan may be welcome news to many farmers, he felt it didn’t go far enough to protect the industry.\n \n\n   \n  “What US ranchers need is a fair market with the right incentives. We’ve got to encourage rebuilding the cow herd here in the US,” he said.  “This seems to be a quick attempt to control the damage.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/melania-trump-east-wing-first-ladies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-11:25","title":"Melania Trump Has Been Silent on Demolition of the East Wing, Home to First Ladies for Decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump has remained silent on the demolition of the East Wing of the White House, a historic space that has served as the office for first ladies since 1977, marking a significant shift from her active role in preservation projects during her first term.

Asked if the first lady is supportive of the project, her office would not say.\n \n\n   \n  Melania Trump has spent minimal time in the East Wing — which has long served as the entry point for grand White House events like state dinners and receptions — during her husband’s second term in office,  eschewing the nation’s capital  for New York and Palm Beach, where she spends the vast majority of her time.\n \n\n   \n  In Washington, she employs  a skeletal staff  compared to the first term — with just five full-time staff members as of July — but those staffers have relocated during the construction to other office space on White House grounds, according to a White House official.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the First Lady and the social office —   which oversees major events at the White House — are now inside the executive mansion, split between the Vermeil Room, the South Mezzanine, the Library and the China Room. Other departments that had office space in the East Wing have been moved to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, including the White House Military Office, the calligraphers, the White House Visitors Office, and the Office of Legislative Affairs, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not responded to CNN’s inquiry as to whether plans for the ballroom construction will include permanent replacement office space for the first lady’s staff.\n \n\n   \n  But the scope of the renovations — and the lack of messaging from Melania Trump’s office — underscores the first lady’s changed role in Washington, which is a departure from her tenure during the first term and that of former first ladies.\n \n\n   \n  In her husband’s first term, Trump was an active steward of White House preservation. She helped oversee the  restoration  of the Bellangé suite of furniture in the Blue Room. She replaced the rug in the Diplomatic Reception Room. She was  involved  in a 2020 redesign of the White House Rose Garden – an effort to improve drainage and audio-visual equipment that drew  criticism  at the time. And shortly after the 2020 election, she unveiled a new White House tennis pavilion, which subsequently  won  multiple architectural awards.\n \n\n   \n  This time around, her husband has spearheaded major projects – and she has declined to weigh in publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “Watching the demolition is the physical embodiment of watching the first lady’s role become smaller and smaller,” said Kate Andersen Brower, author of “First Women,” a book exploring the power and role of modern first ladies.\n \n\n   \n  Brower added: “She’s making it clear that – like her husband – she’s not going to be like any other first lady. … She doesn’t care about historic precedent, either.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing was first constructed in 1902 and the structure was reimagined during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Rosalynn Carter became the first first lady to use the East Wing as her office in 1977.\n \n\n   \n  “Since Monday, I have heard from alumni of the East Wing from multiple administrations who are understandably stunned by the images. First ladies’ staff lived and witnessed history within those walls and nothing can take away the memories of working in that extraordinarily special place of purpose and service,” said Anita McBride, who worked in the East Wing as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush.\n \n\n   \n  And the lack of engagement on the issue from the current first lady has surprised observers.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be like — you’re really close to your next door neighbor, but they decided to demolish your garage for a basketball court, and you didn’t really say anything about it,” said Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist who chronicled the Trump family and wrote the book “Free, Melania.”\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for America’s living former first ladies — Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden — did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on their reaction to the demolition.\n \n\n   \n  But Clinton  weighed  in on social media Tuesday, linking to reports of the demolition: “It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/americas/caribbean-strike-survivor-ecuador-drug-smuggling-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila Survived U.S. Military Boat Strike; Family Says He’s a Fisherman, Not a Criminal","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, a 41-year-old Ecuadorian fisherman with a prior U.S. drug smuggling conviction, survived a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean, which killed two others and led to the U.S. government labeling him a 'terrorist.'

Despite a drug record, his family says he’s a fisherman caught in Trump’s war at sea \n       \n  By David Culver, Abel Alvarado, Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The last time Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila’s sister heard from   him was about a year ago when he told her he was heading out to fish for work, she said. Last week, she was shocked to learn that her brother was aboard an alleged drug vessel that was struck by the US military.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila, 41, was one of two people who survived last week’s  strike  in the Caribbean, which President Donald Trump said was carried out against a “drug-carrying submarine” navigating toward the United States. Two others were killed.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila and the other survivor were later returned by the US to their countries of origin, Trump said, describing them as “terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  “No, no … He’s not. He’s not a criminal,” Tufiño Chila’s sister, who asked for her name to not be published out of fear for her safety, told CNN from a small coastal town two hours from the Ecuadorian port city of Guayaquil.\n \n\n   \n  She claims to know nothing of her brother’s alleged involvement with drug trafficking and instead portrayed him as a desperate father trying to provide for his six kids. Tufiño Chila’s wife left him and took the children, but he still sent them money, his sister said.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s very happy, fun,” she said of her brother. “He’s everything I loved most.”\n \n\n   \n  She still hasn’t heard from her brother since he was released by Ecuadorian authorities this week after returning home.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s Attorney General’s Office said Monday that authorities have no information that Tufiño Chila committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. But he has a criminal record in the US: Court documents show that he was arrested, convicted and jailed in 2020 for smuggling drugs off Mexico’s coast before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila’s sister said two other brothers were arrested months earlier, also on drug smuggling charges. Both are in custody: one is in the US, the other is in Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n    Pacific transit route\n \n\n   \n  The family’s   experience illustrates how Ecuador has become a critical route in the cocaine trade. About 70% of the world’s cocaine supply passes from Colombia and Peru through its shores, Ecuador’s president says.\n \n\n   \n  Drug runners often transport narcotics through a large stretch of water on the Pacific Ocean and drop them off in Mexico, where they’re subsequently smuggled  into the US  or Europe.\n \n\n   \n  The drug trafficking trade is hard to escape in Tufiño Chila’s town, according to those who live there.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is complicated. It’s hard,” one man tells CNN of fishermen’s financial struggles, where monthly wages can be as little as $100.\n \n\n   \n  Becoming a drug runner is an enticing prospect when one can make tens of thousands of dollars up front, according to another fisherman who spoke to CNN in March from  Manta , an Ecuadorian city on the Pacific coast.\n \n\n   \n  The profession has also found itself at the crosshairs of the Trump administration. On Tuesday, the  US expanded  its military campaign of attacking boats it suspected of illegal drug running, hitting a vessel in the eastern Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  Both people on board were killed, according to US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  It was the eighth known strike by the US military on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the start of September. All seven previous strikes had targeted boats in the Caribbean Sea, just north of Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  To date, at least 34 people have been killed in the US strikes – 32 of them in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration says they’re about saving American lives from drug overdoses. But most US overdose deaths aren’t from cocaine. They’re from  fentanyl , largely produced in Mexico and smuggled over the border by land, often by US citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As the US strikes continue, the ones caught in the crossfire are rarely cartel leaders, but the men who  take the risk for them . They’re fishermen often seen as expendable by the gangs that hire them.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila’s sister showed CNN around the house where they lived before her brother went away. His room is kept like a shrine, with a lit candle to honor him and his clothes folded neatly on his bed.\n \n\n   \n  She hopes to speak with her brother soon. For now, she takes comfort in knowing he’s alive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/cycling-emma-pooley-eating-disorders-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-04:00","title":"Former Cyclist Emma Pooley Exposes 'Unscientific Bullying' Around Food in Elite Cycling","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Emma Pooley, a former professional cyclist, reflects on the long-term physical and mental health consequences of disordered eating in elite cycling.

bullying’ around food amid the sport’s high prevalence of eating disorders \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Emma Pooley may have retired from professional  cycling  around a decade ago, but she believes that the effects of under-fueling – what she describes as her “weird” relationship with food – are still with her.\n \n\n   \n  Those scars, Pooley says, are “permanent” and include having a bone density which is “10 to 20 years older than I actually am.”\n \n\n   \n  When it comes to eating, the British former cyclist has found her mindset to be complicated and often contradictory. Pooley has always loved food, recently publishing a  cookbook  with some of her best and favorite recipes; but she also recognizes how her cycling career made her develop worrying and unhealthy habits.\n \n\n   \n  “I sort of thought I shouldn’t eat as much, and it took a while to get through that and to realize that, actually, the more I ate, the faster I was,” Pooley tells CNN Sports. “And I didn’t put on weight because I was training lots.”\n \n\n   \n  For most of her racing career, Pooley says that she believed she was fat, restricting her diet and avoiding certain foods when her body was craving them the most. It’s an approach that was born out of seeing “really, really skinny people” around her in the peloton, as well as the false assumption that being lighter makes you a faster and better cyclist.\n \n\n   \n  The effects of under-eating for professional athletes, Pooley has discovered, can be dangerous and long-lasting.\n \n\n   \n  “With women, if you’re underweight for a long time, you end up messing your hormones around and (can develop) low bone density,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  “My bone density is lower than it should be, and I keep getting stress fractures. I run lots now – that’s my main sport and I still race competitively. In the last seven years, I’ve had a stress fracture in my femur and a stress fracture in my foot. I don’t know if they’re directly caused by years of under-fueling, but it certainly wouldn’t have helped.”\n \n\n   \n   Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport  (REDs) occurs when an athlete of any gender has overtrained and/or under-eaten for a prolonged period in an attempt to improve their performance, often without knowing the dangers of failing to compensate for the energy they expend in training and racing.\n \n\n   \n  Poor bone health is just one knock-on effect. Medical experts say that REDs can damage an athlete’s metabolism, their immune system, their cardiovascular health, their menstrual cycle, and their mental health, as well as their athletic performance.\n \n\n   \n  The condition isn’t limited to cycling, but under-eating has become a flashpoint in the sport in recent years. A  scoping review  published in December 2022 found that competitive cycling has “a high prevalence of disordered eating and/or eating disorders,” while several athletes have spoken openly about their troubled relationships with food.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview  with Cycling Weekly last year, Slovenian Jan Tratnik said that his desperation to lose weight led him to develop bulimia – binge-eating large amounts of food and purging it to avoid weight gain.\n \n\n   \n  “I couldn’t handle being starving, so I cracked and ate too much,” Tratnik said. “Being afraid to gain weight, it was a circle I couldn’t escape from.”\n \n\n   \n  Cédrine Kerbaol, a professional cyclist and nutritionist,  said  during this year’s Tour de France Femmes that the sport is at a “dangerous time” when it comes to thinness and weight loss.\n \n\n   \n  “These recent years, it has been very fashionable to count every gram on our plates,” she told French newspaper L’Humanité. “We must not fall into a form of dehumanization and infantilization.”\n \n\n   \n  Former Tour de France champion and five-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins, meanwhile,  said  in 2019 that “the focus on being light as a rider … can lead to depression, it can lead to things worse than that.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a combination of factors which make elite cyclists more susceptible to eating disorders and disordered eating, including riders not wanting to show weakness and facing pressure from coaches and team managers.\n \n\n   \n  Pooley, who was crowned world time trial champion in 2010 and won an Olympic silver medal in 2008, has first-hand exposure to what she calls “unscientific kind of bullying” around food from team officials.\n \n\n   \n  She points to one instance when, after winning a race in Montreal, she was reprimanded for ordering a hot chocolate.\n \n\n   \n  “What I did experience was teams with directors who watched what you ate,” says Pooley. “So with no kind of measure and no science behind it, they just kind of watched you balefully and got cross with you if you ate the wrong thing.\n \n\n   \n  “Back when I was racing, certainly from some team directors, they seem to think that enjoying food was in some way wrong because food is just a tool,” she adds. “It’s just fuel, and you shouldn’t enjoy it. If you enjoy food, you’ll get fat. And that is so wrong. I really think that enjoying food is an important part of a healthy diet.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Jack Hardwicke, a social scientist at Nottingham Trent University in England, the notion that cycling is a “weight-sensitive sport” is “very engrained from the elite level down,” often triggering patterns of unhealthy behaviors in riders.\n \n\n   \n  That is even filtered through the language used by those in management positions.\n \n\n   \n  “Coaches have a responsibility that when they’re coaching, what are they focusing on?” Hardwicke tells CNN Sports. “How are they talking about weight? How are they talking about body image? How are they helping athletes develop a healthy relationship between their sport, their health and performance, and what’s the balance?”\n \n\n   \n  In elite cycling, Hardwicke adds, “team managers might not see their athletes as humans all the time – they see them as people that they need to perform for the team to survive.”\n \n\n   \n  For riders, the toll of under-eating is not just on their bodies, but also on their mental wellbeing.\n \n\n   \n  “When you speak to people that have suffered with eating disorders and disordered eating, the mental battle is really the biggest part,” says Hardwicke. “It’s very closely aligned with things like body image issues, self-confidence issues … I think that’s where the real issue is.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN Sports, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling’s global governing body, referred to a previous  statement  on REDs syndrome, which said: “The UCI’s role is to raise awareness of the health risks associated with uncontrolled weight loss, and to support doctors with resources to facilitate their work in clinical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “For this, the UCI is in the process of finalising documentation and tools that can be used by team doctors to enable the diagnosis of REDs. The strategy is to rely on a screening and risk-assessment tool validated and published by an International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus group.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Pooley, she admits that cycling has “changed a lot” since she initially retired in 2014, with the most successful teams “encouraging riders to eat better and eat more.”\n \n\n   \n  Today, she firmly believes that food and sport form a natural partnership – “the more you train, the more you have to eat,” adds Pooley – and has made strong, mental connections between moments in her cycling career and things she ate at the time.\n \n\n   \n  That affiliation is partly why the 43-year-old decided to publish “Oat to Joy,” which is part recipe book inspired by the humbleness and versatility of oats, part autobiography chronicling food-based memories from her cycling career.\n \n\n   \n  “I can exactly remember the pizza at the end of the Giro (d’Italia) in 2011 after I didn’t win,” says Pooley. “Certainly, with races, I can remember the special food that we had the dinner after.

Activists want to make it a model for the country \n       \n  By Audrey Dutton, ProPublica\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   This story was originally published by  ProPublica ,  a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.  Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive its stories in your inbox every week. \n \n\n   \n  Three women become choked up as they deliver news in a video posted to social media. “We did it, everybody,” says Leslie Manookian, the woman in the middle. She is a driving force in a campaign that has chipped away at the foundations of modern public health in Idaho. The group had just gotten lawmakers to pass what she called the first true “medical freedom” bill in the nation. “It’s literally landmark,” Manookian said. “It is changing everything.”\n \n\n   \n  With Manookian in  the video  are two of her allies, the leaders of Health Freedom Idaho. It was April 4, hours after the governor signed the  Idaho Medical Freedom Act  into law.\n \n\n   \n  The act makes it illegal for state and local governments, private businesses, employers, schools and daycares to require anyone to take a vaccine or receive any other “medical intervention.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether the law will actually alter day-to-day life in Idaho is an open question, because Idaho already made it easy to get around the few existing vaccination requirements.\n \n\n   \n  But it could have a significant effect in other states, where rules aren’t already so relaxed. And it comes at a time when diseases once eradicated from the U.S. through vaccination are making a resurgence.\n \n\n   \n  The law runs against one of the hallmarks of modern public health: that a person’s full participation in society depends on their willingness to follow certain rules. (Want to send your child to public school? They’ll need a measles vaccine. Want to work in a retirement community during flu season? You might have to wear a mask.)\n \n\n   \n  The new Idaho law flips that on its head. It not only removes the obligation to follow such rules, it makes the rules themselves illegal.\n \n\n   \n  The new law sets Idaho apart from even conservative-leaning South Carolina, where  two schools recently  quarantined more than 150 unvaccinated children after measles arrived.\n \n\n   \n  A person  can spread measles  for four days before symptoms appear. During the South Carolina schools’ quarantine, five students began to show symptoms, but the quarantine kept them from spreading it,  the health department said this month .\n \n\n   \n  That precaution would now be illegal in Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s law caught the attention of people who share Manookian’s belief that — contrary to  hundreds of years of public health evidence and rigorous regulation in the U.S.  — vaccines are worse than the diseases they prevent.\n \n\n   \n  It also caught the attention of people like Jennifer Herricks, a pro-vaccine advocate in Louisiana and  advocacy director for American Families for Vaccines .\n \n\n   \n  Herricks and her counterparts in other states say that vaccine requirements have “done so much good for our kids and for our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  An  analysis published last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  found that routine childhood vaccines prevented more than 1.1 million deaths and 32 million hospitalizations in the U.S. over three decades, saving $540 billion in direct costs and saving society about $2.7 trillion. The analysis was limited; it didn’t account for the lives and money saved by vaccines for flu or RSV, which kill and hospitalize babies and children each year.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s move was “pretty concerning,” Herricks said, “especially seeing the direction that everything is headed at the federal government.”\n \n\n   \n  The law is the culmination of a decade of anti-vaccine activism that got a boost from the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  It’s rooted in a belief system that distrusts institutions — government health agencies, vaccine makers, medical societies and others — on the premise that those institutions seek only money and control.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian said in an interview that she believes one person should never be told to risk their health in “the theoretical” service of another.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Manookian and her allies have a new goal in their sights: to make Idaho’s legislation a nationwide standard.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho was already more permissive than other states when it came to vaccine rules. Parents since at least the 1990s could send unvaccinated children to school if they signed a form saying vaccination went against their religious or personal beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  That wasn’t good enough for Idahoans who describe themselves as advocates for health freedom. They worked to shift the paradigm, bit by bit, so that it can be easier now for parents to get a vaccine exemption than to show the school their child is actually vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, lawmakers ordered schools and daycare centers to tell parents about  the exemptions allowed in Idaho  whenever they communicate about immunizations.\n \n\n   \n  The state also decided to let parents exempt their kids by writing a note, instead of having to fill out a form — one that, in the past, required them to acknowledge the risks of going unvaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  (There is conflicting data on whether these changes truly affected vaccination rates or just led more parents to skip the trouble of handing in vaccine records. Starting in 2021, Idaho schools reported a steady drop in the share of kindergartners with documented vaccinations.  Phone surveys  of parents, by contrast, showed vaccination rates have been largely unchanged.)\n \n\n   \n  An enduring backlash against Idaho’s short-lived COVID-19 mandates gave Manookian’s movement more momentum, culminating this year in what she considered the ultimate step in Idaho’s evolution.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian had a previous career in finance in New York and London. She transitioned to work as a homeopath and advocate, ultimately returning to her home state of Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  The bill she came up with said that almost nobody can be required to have a vaccine or take any test or medical procedure or treatment in order to go to school, get a job or go about life how they’d like to. In practice, that would mean schools couldn’t send unvaccinated kids home, even during a measles outbreak, and private businesses and daycares couldn’t require people on their property to follow public health guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.\n \n\n   \n  Her theory was right, ultimately.\n \n\n   \n  The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.\n \n\n   \n  But the governor vetoed it.  In a letter , he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.\n \n\n   \n  This time, Little signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, D.C., for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.\n \n\n   \n  At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian  told the audience  in May.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing  model legislation and a how-to guide , with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit  Stand For Health Freedom  to mobilize activists in every state.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with ProPublica, Manookian said her objective is for people to “understand and appreciate that the most basic and fundamental of human rights is the right to direct our own medical treatment — and to codify that in law in every state. Breaking that barrier in Idaho proves that it can be done, that Americans understand the importance of this, and the humanity of it, and that it should be done in other states.”\n \n\n   \n  Her efforts were rewarded over the summer with a visit from none other than Kennedy, who visited Boise and toured a farm  with Manookian and state lawmakers in tow. \n \n\n   \n  “This state, more than any other state in the country” aligns with the MAHA campaign, Kennedy told reporters at a news conference where no one was allowed to ask questions. Kennedy called Idaho “the home of medical freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment from Kennedy or his staff on Idaho’s law and his visit to the state.\n \n\n   \n  Children’s Health Defense, the organization Kennedy built into one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines, took interest in the Idaho bill early on.\n \n\n   \n  The group promoted the bill as it sat on the governor’s desk, as he vetoed it, then as Manookian worked successfully to get a revived bill through the statehouse and signed into law.\n \n\n   \n  The organization’s online video programming featured Manookian five times in late March and early April. One show’s host told viewers they could follow Idaho in its “very smart strategy” of taking a law against COVID-related mandates, “crossing out ‘COVID,’ making a few other tweaks, and you have an incredible health freedom bill after that.”\n \n\n   \n  Children’s Health Defense CEO  Mary Holland  said she’s known Manookian for more than 15 years and pushed the national organization to publicize Manookian’s work. Holland introduced her at the Washington, D.C., event.\n \n\n   \n  Whereas most states put the onus on unvaccinated people to show why they should opt out of a mandate, Idaho’s legislation made unvaccinated people the norm — shifting the burden of accommodation onto those who support vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  Now, parents of infants too young for a measles vaccine can’t choose a daycare that requires immunization. Parents of immune-compromised students must decide whether to keep their children home from school during an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases, knowing unvaccinated children won’t be quarantined.\n \n\n   \n  Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements imposed by states like California and New York.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you could certainly do that in Idaho.” Holland said. “It wouldn’t be a public school. It might be the Church of Vaccinia school.”\n \n\n   \n  The day Idaho’s Medical Freedom Act was signed, a legislator in Louisiana brought forward  the Louisiana Medical Freedom Act . In a hearing later, she pointed to Idaho as a model.\n \n\n   \n  Louisiana followed Idaho once before in 2024, when it  passed a law  that requires schools to describe the exemptions available to parents whenever they communicate about immunizations. Idaho had passed an almost identical law three years earlier.\n \n\n   \n  Herricks, the Louisiana pro-vaccine advocate, said she watched the Idaho Medical Freedom Act’s progress with “a lot of concern, seeing how much progress it was making.” Now it’s set a precedent, Herricks said.\n \n\n   \n  Holland, the Children’s Health Defense CEO, said she looks forward to Idaho’s approach spreading.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to a September announcement by Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo that he intends to rid his state of all vaccine mandates. Holland said she expects other Republican-controlled states to take a serious look at the Idaho law. (Ladapo’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big change,” Holland said. “It’s not just related to vaccines. It’s a blow against the notion that there can be compulsory medicine.”\n \n\n   \n  Some people support the  more-than-century-old notion  that compelling people to be vaccinated or masked will provide such enormous collective benefits that it outweighs any inconvenience or small incursion on personal liberty.\n \n\n   \n  Others, like Holland and Manookian, do not.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of laws like Idaho’s is a sense of, “‘I’m going to do what I want to do for myself, and I don’t want anybody telling me what to do,’ which is in direct contrast to public health,” said Paul Offit, pediatrician and vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n \n\n   \n  Offit, who co-invented a vaccine against rotavirus, is a critic of Kennedy and was removed from a federal vaccine panel in September.\n \n\n   \n  A more fundamental conflict is that some people believe vaccines and other tools to prevent the spread of illness, like masks, are harmful. That belief is at odds with the overwhelming consensus of scientists and health experts, including Kennedy’s own  Department of Health and Human Services  and the  CDC .\n \n\n   \n  Both tensions are at play in Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  As is the case nationally, Idaho’s “health freedom” movement has long pushed back against being labeled “anti-vaccine.” Idaho lawmakers and advocates have stressed that their goals are bodily autonomy and informed choice.\n \n\n   \n  They do not take a stance on the bodily autonomy principle when it comes to abortion, however. Almost all state legislators who voted for the Idaho Medical Freedom Act also voted to ban abortion, if they were in office at both times.\n \n\n   \n  “Every action has to be evaluated on its individual morality,” not on whether it does the most good for the most people, Manookian said.\n \n\n   \n  But Manookian’s rejection of vaccine mandates goes beyond a libertarian philosophy.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian has said publicly that she thinks vaccines are “poison for profit,” that continuing to let daycares require vaccination would “put our children on the chopping block,” that measles is “positive for the body,” that the virus protects against cancer, and that it can send people “into total remission” — an assertion she made on an Idaho wellness center’s podcast in April.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian told ProPublica she believes infectious diseases have been made “the bogeyman.”\n \n\n   \n  Against those claims, research has shown that having the measles  suppresses immunity to other diseases , a phenomenon dubbed  “immune amnesia”  that can make children who have recovered from measles  more susceptible to pneumonia and other bacterial and viral infections . About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected will die from complications of the disease,  according to the CDC .\n \n\n   \n  And while researchers have studied using engineered measles viruses in a cancer treatment,  those same researchers have written that  they were “dismayed to learn” their research has been misconstrued by some who oppose vaccination. They said they “very strongly advise” giving children the measles vaccine, that there “is no evidence that measles infection can protect against cancer” and that measles is “a dangerous pathogen, not suitable for use as a cancer therapy.”\n \n\n   \n  (Manookian said she believes she has evidence for her cancer remission claim but couldn’t readily produce it, adding that she may have been mistaken.)\n \n\n   \n  The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, meanwhile, is safe and highly effective, according to  the American Academy of Pediatrics ,  the Infectious Diseases Society of America  and  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , among others. The CDC says the  most common negative reactions  are a sore arm, fever or mild rash. Two doses of the vaccine provide near total protection, according to the CDC.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian said she doesn’t believe the research on vaccines has been adequate.\n \n\n   \n  She will have another chance to spread her views from a prominent platform in November, when she’s scheduled to speak at the  Children’s Health Defense 2025 conference  in Austin, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  She’ll share the stage with celebrities in the anti-vaccine movement: Del Bigtree, communications director for Kennedy’s past presidential campaign; actor Russell Brand; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson; and Ladapo, the Florida surgeon general who made headlines for his push to end vaccine mandates in Florida, months after Idaho wrote that concept into law.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/style/paris-fondation-cartier-jean-nouvel","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Fondation Cartier’s new home opens in Paris, in a prized spot facing the Louvre","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Fondation Cartier has opened a new, centrally located museum in Paris, directly opposite the Louvre, following a major renovation led by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel.

opens in Paris, in a prized spot facing the Louvre \n       \n  Vivian Song\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After a years-long renovation project, the Fondation Cartier art museum will open its doors on Saturday to its new home, opposite the Louvre in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  While little has changed externally, the stately 19th-century building, which was a former hotel and department store, has undergone a radical redesign within. The Haussmannian building has been transformed by  Pritzker prize-winning  architect Jean Nouvel, who describes his latest project as an “industrial cathedral” of modular spaces.\n \n\n   \n  The dramatic 70,000-square-foot exhibition space features tall bay windows that create a sense of transparency, blurring the boundaries between the inside and outside world.\n \n\n   \n  Pedestrians, bikers and the city’s traffic serve as complementary, theatrical background sets, while curious passersby can peek through the windows to catch glimpses of the artworks. High glass ceilings near the main entrance funnel in natural light.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Dercon, the museum’s managing director, told CNN that the design “is a dialogue with the history and urban context of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  But the most interesting design feature is no doubt the system of five steel, mobile platforms that can be raised and lowered in nearly a dozen ways to reconfigure the exhibition space, in order to “reinvent” the visitor experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing is permanent,” Mathieu Forest, director of production and architectural design at Ateliers Jean Nouvel studios, told journalists at Monday’s press preview.\n \n\n   \n  “Not the floor, not the walls, not the ceiling…next time, maybe this platform will be higher or lower. You will have an entirely new perspective.”\n \n\n   \n  Cables and pulleys have also been left deliberately exposed, he adds, as they are “live tools” for artists and curators.\n \n\n   \n  The adjustable viewing platforms can also offer different perspectives – and experiences – of a single piece. Standing floor level and gazing head on at Colombian artist Olga de Amaral’s monumental textile work, “Muros en rojos,” reveals the fine details of the thousands of wool and horsehair mosaic-like strips.\n \n\n   \n  Climbing up a few flights of stairs for a view from above and afar, however, changes the viewer’s relationship to the tapestry, as it becomes an autumnal, pixelated amber, red and burnt ochre backdrop that evokes the colors of Amaral’s native Bogota landscape.\n \n\n   \n  “Contemporary art takes on extremely varied forms,” notes Emilie Besse, a French journalist who specializes in the intersection of art and luxury.\n \n\n   \n  “And if we want to be able to present absolutely all forms of creative expression, you need a space that can adapt.”\n \n\n   \n  The inaugural show “Exposition Générale,” is a nod to the building’s heritage as a former 19th century department store, the Grands Magasins du Louvre, which showcased the latest trends in fashion, technologies and household items in museum-like exhibits of the same name. Artworks, curated from the foundation’s existing collection, are categorized under four broad themes that explore architecture, the living world, techniques and materials, and the relationship between science and artistic creation.\n \n\n   \n  Where the modular configuration may risk confusion, however, is in the absence of direction or clear signage that can help visitors make sense of the thematically grouped works.\n \n\n   \n    Luxury brands’ influence on French art world\n \n\n   \n  The innovative arts space, which cost more than an estimated 230 million euros ($267 million) to renovate, according to French media, follows in the foundation’s tradition of shaping the city’s the modern art scene.\n \n\n   \n  When the museum first opened in 1984 in the Paris suburb of Jouy-en-Josas under the direction of Alain Dominique Perrin, it became the first corporate foundation in the country to promote contemporary art, paving the way for the likes of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, which opened in 2014, and the Bourse de Commerce, which houses the contemporary art collection of Kering founder François Pinault and opened in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to understand that, unlike other countries, culture in France has been, for decades, and centuries even, something that was supported by the public sector and that belonged to the state,” explains Fabien Simode, president of the French chapter of the Association of International Art Critics.\n \n\n   \n  “When Cartier arrived in the 1980s, they showed that another path was possible.”\n \n\n   \n  While the relationship between luxury brands and cultural institutions is now firmly established in France, Besse acknowledges that it can still cause some discomfort among some critics.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, when the Grand Palais, which has received tens of millions of euros in donations from Chanel, named one of its main entrance ways after the brand’s founder, Gabrielle Chanel, it raised concerns of commercial opportunism and appropriation of a heritage site, Besse said.\n \n\n   \n  “But ultimately there are very strong affinities between luxury and art, as luxury brands have historically been houses of expertise and creation,” she adds. “So there’s a natural bridge between these two worlds.”\n \n\n   \n  Public and private, luxury-branded institutions also have drastically different approaches that decrease the risk of overlap or competition, Simode points out. While public institutions can sometimes be scientific, encyclopedic, even cold in their faithfulness to detail, private institutions often have more freedom to take an aesthetic and dynamic approach, and have proven their legitimacy, Simode adds.\n \n\n   \n    New visitors\n \n\n   \n  For its opening exhibition the foundation has curated 600 works by 100 international artists including David Lynch, Patti Smith and Damien Hirst, to Congolese artist Bodys Isek Kingelez and Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang.\n \n\n   \n  For Jean-Christophe Castelain, director of the Le Journal des Arts, a bimonthly art publication, the Fondation Cartier’s strength is in scouting international, sometimes little known talents who fall somewhere between big commercial artists whose work appeals to the general public, such as Jeff Koons, and the more obscure, experimental artists who can be radically niche.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fondation Cartier is somewhere in between, and that’s also what makes it so strong,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Castelain cites hyperrealist Australian sculptor Ron Mueck as an example of an artist who got a major boost from the foundation in France after becoming the first French institution to host a solo exhibition back in 2005, and then in 2013 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps more than its initial programming, it’s the museum’s newly central location, increased space – five times the area of its former home – and proximity to the world’s most visited museum, the Louvre, that will attract new audiences, notably tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Nouvel was also the architect behind the Fondation Cartier’s previous site, which opened in 1994 in a quieter neighborhood on the Left Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “The foundation has been moving towards the center of Paris over the last 40 years,” says Simode, adding that the move is analogous to the city’s growing importance on the international art scene.\n \n\n   \n  “Paris has returned to the center stage.”\n \n\n   \n   “Exposition Générale” is on view until August 2026. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/atlanta-airport-threat-safety-security","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Apparent Thwarted Attack at World’s Busiest Airport Highlights Ongoing Security Risks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparent thwarted attack at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport — the world’s busiest airport — occurred when Billy Joe Cagle, armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a magazine of over 20 rounds, was arrested after his family alerted law enforcement that he was planning to shoot up the airport while livestreaming.

She approached the 350-pound man who towered over her and arrested him – thwarting what police said was a planned attack at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, police said.\n \n\n   \n  Banks on  Monday apprehended Billy Joe Cagle , whose family alerted law enforcement that   ﻿he was armed and headed to the airport   to “shoot it up,” police said.\n \n\n   \n  The quick and thoughtful actions of the suspect’s family and authorities were lauded by experts and officials alike. Still, the incident highlights vulnerabilities in airport security, especially in crowded areas not overseen by TSA officers.\n \n\n   \n  Cagle is facing charges of terroristic threats, criminal attempt to commit aggravated assaults, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n \n\n   \n  He was also charged with several federal counts: attempted violence at an international airport, interstate communications containing threats to injure and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia  said on Tuesday .\n \n\n   \n  Cagle is from Cartersville, about an hour away from Atlanta, and a family member then drove to the police department and alerted authorities that he was armed and on his way to the airport.\n \n\n   \n  After receiving a description of Cagle and his vehicle, Atlanta Police   Sgt. Tywana Jones communicated the   details to the team at the airport.\n \n\n   \n  Inside his vehicle parked in the departure area of the airport, police found an “AR-15 assault rifle” and a magazine with more than two dozen rounds, police said.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart was beating fast. I’m like, OK, I haven’t heard any gunshots, anything go off. So, you know, we’re good right now. Let’s just get that information out to prevent that,” said Jones, who is six months away from retiring from the Atlanta Police Department with 30 years under her belt.\n \n\n   \n  “The tragedies that we’ve seen play out across our nation didn’t happen here,” Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n   With more than 108 million people flying through in 2024 , Hartsfield-Jackson is the world’s busiest airport.\n \n\n   \n    Airport public areas remain vulnerable\n \n\n   \n  “Public areas of airports are still vulnerable; they’re still at risk. And if someone is looking for large groups of people, ticket counters, the lobby areas, the garages, the bag claims, they are not defended by the TSA,” said Mary Schiavo, CNN transportation analyst and former inspector general for the US Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  Enhanced security, like vehicle inspections, were in place after September 11, Schiavo said. Those strict security measures slowed down traffic and travelers and likely would not be welcome again.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody liked it, but it certainly added security,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the measures could be reinstated if similar incidents like the Atlanta case occur again.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavo praised the suspect’s family for coming forward and preventing a potentially significant   attack.\n \n\n   \n  “They not only saved innocent travelers’ lives, they most likely saved their relative’s life because he would have been gunned down,” she said. “There’s lots of cameras and security at the airport that could have responded very quickly. He wouldn’t have made it out. So the family obviously really did a life-saving measure.”\n \n\n   \n  Heightened security could have made a difference in an attack playing out, too, Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  “Checking the cars and checking the bags, the physical security, is what would have made a difference here, if the horrible thing had unfolded … thank God the family called in time.”\n \n\n   \n    Barriers could help\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s apparent thwarted attack will be studied by airport personnel as a success story, according to Keith Jeffries, a former federal security director at Los Angeles International Airport, who spoke to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The communication capability from family to law enforcement and how quick they reacted, that’s tremendous,” Jeffries said. “The fact that the Atlanta Police Department, airport police, responded like they did, that was an exceptional work, to put it mildly”.\n \n\n   \n  However, having cars idle outside terminals or leaving a car behind, such as what happened during Monday’s incident, does present a security risk, Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  Having barriers, even decorative ones, just outside airport doors could help with that, Jeffries added.\n \n\n   \n  “Anytime there’s a large crowd, if someone has bad intentions and wants to make whatever statement or use violence against crowds, that’s a relatively simple thing to do where there’s a crowded area,” Jeffries said. “Putting those barriers in place will help those vehicles from driving straight into an airport, into a crowd … It serves as a bollard to prevent vehicles from pulling up in there.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries, who now serves as the vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, indicated that new technologies might not be the answer to bolster security at airports, unless there’s a machine that can read people’s minds. “That, to my knowledge, doesn’t exist,” he noted.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes all you need is more boots on the ground, like around major travel holidays, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Having a good overt presence, everyone staying alert, being on the lookout. And I think what this is going to do as we approach an even busier season, as Thanksgiving gets closer, I think this message is going to spread like wildfire to all the airports of the value of good communication,” Jeffries said. “This is going to be a great case study for airports to coordinate with the Atlanta Airport on something that went extremely well. Too many times are we studying things that went horribly wrong and learning from that.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s also imperative for travelers to stay alert, calm and vigilant . \n \n\n   \n  “You also need to calm down, pause, and be very aware of your entire domain awareness, what’s going on around you, because at any given point in time, an emergency can occur of some sort, and always just be prepared,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/americas/maduro-trump-venezuela-military-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:28:00-04:00","title":"Maduro boasts of ‘thousands’ of Russian anti-aircraft missiles as Trump threatens military action inside Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro claims Venezuela has 5,000 Russian-made Igla-S anti-aircraft missiles strategically deployed across the country, including remote areas, as a response to escalating U.S. military pressure.

‘thousands’ of Russian anti-aircraft missiles as Trump threatens military action inside Venezuela \n       \n  By Germán Padinger, Rocío Muñoz-Ledo, Kit Maher and Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:28 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Venezuela has 5,000 Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles in “key air defense positions,” its President Nicolás Maduro claimed on Wednesday, amid growing tension over the United States’ military deployment in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has said he is weighing military action inside Venezuela as part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign and a broader effort to weaken Maduro, a longtime foe of Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “Any military force in the world knows the power of the Igla-S and Venezuela has no less than 5,000” of them, Maduro said during an event with military personnel broadcast by Venezolana de Televisión (VTV).\n \n\n   \n  The Russian Igla-S missiles are short-range, low-altitude systems similar to American Stingers. They can shoot down small aerial targets such as cruise missiles and drones, as well as helicopters and low-flying planes.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro said the missiles, light enough to be carried by a single soldier, had been deployed “even in the last mountain, the last town, and the last city of the territory.”\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed 4,500 Marines and sailors to the Caribbean to strengthen operations against cartels and demonstrate military power. It has carried out several lethal strikes on boats  off the Caribbean  coast that it alleges were trafficking narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers from both parties in the US have questioned the legality of the strikes on the alleged “narco boats.”\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Trump said he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the US was considering expanding its military campaign to land, as part of an intensifying US pressure campaign that officials say is aimed at ousting Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months, by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has been responding by repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia members and denouncing US activity in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The people of Venezuela are “clear, united, and aware,” Maduro said in a televised speech last week.\n \n\n   \n  “They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   \n  According to  Rosoboronexport , the Russian state company that exports Igla-S systems, they have a range of up to 6,000 meters and can reach targets at a maximum altitude of 3,500 meters.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of Igla-S missiles cited by Maduro, but they were known to be part of Venezuela’s arsenal, according to the military balance compiled by the  International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). \n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, has been photographed several times with the launchers in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has contacted Venezuela’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/bessent-sanctions-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"02:41:00-04:00","title":"US sanctions Russia’s two largest oil companies and calls on Moscow to agree to immediate ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration announced new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, and nearly 30 of their subsidiaries, as part of a broader effort to pressure Moscow into agreeing to an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing war with Ukraine.

oil companies and calls on Moscow to agree to immediate ceasefire \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, Kit Maher, Kaitlan Collins, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:41 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies as it called on Moscow to agree to an immediate ceasefire in  the war with Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump had for weeks signaled he could impose penalties against Russia for its continuation of the war but had failed to take major punitive measures until Wednesday. The announcement came as Trump said he had “canceled” an anticipated meeting with Putin because he “didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get.”\n \n\n   \n  In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump explained he “felt it was time” for the sanctions, noting he “waited a long time” to impose them. Still, the US president said he hopes “they won’t be on for long” because the war will end.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement Wednesday that it was “the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire.”\n \n\n   \n  “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent added: “Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions hit Rosneft and Lukoil and almost three dozen of their subsidiaries. The United Kingdom targeted the two oil companies last week, and the European Union formally adopted another package of sanctions, includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports, on Thursday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The EU’s sanctions envoy David O’Sullivan will meet with top Treasury Department official John Hurley on Thursday, a Treasury spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna praised Wednesday’s announcement, which she said “comes after numerous attempts to give Russia a chance to begin real negotiations to end the war.”\n \n\n   \n  “The decision is fully aligned with Ukraine’s consistent position: peace is possible only through strength and pressure on the aggressor using all available international tools,” Stefanishyna said in  a post on X , adding that she also expects “strong decisions from European partners tomorrow, following the meeting of the European Council.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine had been calling for increased pressure on Moscow as the war has raged on. Diplomatic efforts to end the war have stalled and Russia has rejected the notion of freezing the conflict for negotiations – something that Ukraine and Europe have said they support.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said last week that he intended to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. However, Trump said on Wednesday he had “canceled” that anticipated summit, telling reporters, “It just didn’t feel right to me,” although he said they would meet in the future.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier this week  that Trump’s hopes for a quick meeting with Putin had stalled out , with an administration official saying Tuesday there were “no plans” for a summit between the two “in the immediate future.”\n \n\n   \n  The impact of the new US sanctions will be greatly determined by how they are implemented and whether the administration pushes ahead with secondary sanctions, one expert told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “So far what’s come out is these primary sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, but the key then will be if there’s a threat of secondary sanctions on banks, oil refineries and traders in third countries who are dealing with Rosneft and Lukoil,” said Eddie Fishman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the Biden administration announced sanctions on other  top Russian oil companies , but held off on targeting Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  Officials argued at the time that they waited until the waning days of the administration to impose the sanctions in part because of the state of the global oil market and the potential impact on the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously wavered on imposing further sanctions on Russia.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at the G7 in June why not impose sanctions, Trump said, “When I sanction a country, it costs the US a tremendous amount of money,” adding, “Sanctions are not easy. It is not just a one-way street.”\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement came hours after Russia launched a  large-scale air attack  on Ukraine, including Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Wednesday, Bessent previewed the new sanctions as “one of the largest,” noting  Trump’s disappointment  with Putin and the state of talks to end the war in Ukraine, following a  summit in Alaska  more than two months ago.\n \n\n   \n  “President Putin has not come to the table in an honest, forthright manner as we hoped. There were talks in Alaska; President Trump walked away when he realized that things were not moving forward,” Bessent told Fox Business. “There have been behind-the-scenes talks, but I believe that the president is disappointed at … where we are in these talks.”\n \n\n   \n  “These are sanctions, not secondary tariffs,” Bessent added. “These are going to be substantial and powerful, and we are urging our European and G7 allies plus Canada and Australia to come along with us.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/03/11/business/campus-union-organizing-dartmouth-basketball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00.000-04:00","title":"Dartmouth basketball’s union vote is just a small part of the campus organizing wave","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a growing wave of student union organizing in U.S. colleges and universities, with a significant milestone occurring at Dartmouth College where the men’s basketball team became the first college athletes to vote to join a union.

\n        11:24 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If you want to find the most new union members, don’t go to a  Starbucks  or an  Amazon warehouse , despite the high profile organizing wins unions have achieved with those employers in recent years. Head to college and university campuses.\n \n\n   \n  The Dartmouth College men’s basketball team achieved a significant milestone last week when they became the first college athletes to vote to join a union. But they are only a small part of a much larger trend – that of   college and graduate students voting in big numbers to join unions in their on-campus jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Organizing vote wins in higher education have added more new union members than in any other sector of the economy in recent years, said Christian Sweeney, deputy organizing director at the AFL-CIO.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been happening for a while,” he said. “It’s young people saying we’ve got to protect our interests here. It’s really very much grassroots driven.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union representation votes for private sector employers such as Dartmouth, reports 38 separate elections in just the last two years, including the Dartmouth basketball vote, bringing 41,500 student employees into various unions. And that doesn’t include additional students at state schools who are joining unions, but operate under a different labor law.\n \n\n   \n  For example, student assistants at the California State University system voted overwhelmingly to join a union last month, bringing 20,000 into the CSU Employees Union. National totals for those state school union gains are not available, however.\n \n\n   \n  And similar to the 13-2 margin vote in favor of the union at the Dartmouth basketball team last week, the unions are winning these votes overwhelmingly. Overall 90% of the students voting in the NLRB representation elections voted in favor of the unions.\n \n\n   \n    Other union wins at Dartmouth\n \n\n   \n  The Dartmouth basketball vote might never have happened if not for another recent union win at the school, an organizing win by the Student Workers Collective at Dartmouth, which organized 173 students working in food service jobs on campus by winning a vote 52-0 in April of 2022.\n \n\n   \n  It won its first union contract, including big pay raises, about a year later after the newly-formed union voted to authorize a strike. Starting pay, which had been $13 an hour, jumped to $21. More-veteran workers are making between $26 or $28.\n \n\n   \n  “Our entire unit was ready to strike. We let them know it would happen,” said a Dartmouth junior and a leader of the union who asked that her name not be used. “In 24 hours [Dartmouth administration] scheduled a meeting with us and accepted all our demands.”\n \n\n   \n  She said while getting more money was helping students, some workers used the higher pay to work fewer hours.\n \n\n   \n  “Especially at Dartmouth every hour here is precious,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  One of those workers impressed by the pay raise was Cade Haskins, a junior majoring in politics, philosophy and economics who, in addition to his job at a campus snack bar, is a forward on the basketball team.\n \n\n   \n  He started talking to his teammates about how the basketball players, who do not receive a scholarship, should form a union as well. He eventually became one of the leaders of the effort.\n \n\n   \n  The other leader of the union effort has been team captain Romeo Myrthil, who came to Dartmouth from Sweden. He was surprised to find how few Americans belong to unions compared to his homeland, one of the most heavily unionized countries in the world.\n \n\n   \n  “There are many things about America that are tough to adjust to,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Organizing athletes still uphill battle\n \n\n   \n  The vote last week by the Dartmouth basketball team rightly got a lot of attention as the first group of college athletes to vote to join a union. But the union efforts for the team aren’t yet over. Dartmouth basketball players don’t get a scholarship, and the college has announced it will seek to overturn the union vote, arguing that they are not employees.\n \n\n   \n  “We have productive relationships with so many unions. We believe our athletes are students,” Dartmouth President Sian Beilock told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an  interview last month . “We don’t give athletic scholarships. We are student-athletes here, and we believe our students should be thought of in that way.”\n \n\n   \n  But the NLRB regional director ruled that because Dartmouth “has the right to control the work performed by the Dartmouth men’s basketball team, and the players perform that work in exchange for compensation,” they could be considered employees. That compensation includes “room and board for part of the year, equipment, apparel, tickets to both home and road games, footwear, access to nutrition and medical professionals, exclusive use of certain facilities, and academic support.”\n \n\n   \n  Haskins and Myrthil said they’re not expecting big dollars for playing basketball. Dartmouth testified that the team only brings in revenue of $458,000 a year.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to have a voice at the table is what’s important to us,” Haskins said.\n \n\n   \n  Haskins, who’s from Minneapolis, said his grandmother is the only member of his family that has been in a union before, and only briefly just before she retired.\n \n\n   \n  “Initially my mom was telling me, ‘Don’t do it, don’t get kicked off the team,’” he recalled when he told his parents about his union efforts. But he said they eventually came around and supported him.\n \n\n   \n  Some Dartmouth alumni at a recent game   also had mixed feelings about the union effort. At a recent Dartmouth road game at Columbia University, Douglas Murphy, Dartmouth class of ’78 and a former basketball player at the school, said he was happy to see the union effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I take my hat off to them,” said Murphy, who was a union member himself for 36 years as a state employee in New York. “I wish we had a union when I was playing. We had some big problems with staff when I was playing. We needed it.”\n \n\n   \n  One section away in the Columbia bleachers, Ed Burns, Dartmouth class of 1985, said he’s worried about what unionization would mean to schools that aren’t in big dollar athletic conferences, such as the Ivy League where Dartmouth plays.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not talking about Michigan football or Alabama football,” he said, referring to two of the most profitable college sports teams. “Will the Ivy League schools get together and say, ‘We’ll just offer club sports?’ I hope not, but that could be the long-term implications of this.”\n \n\n   \n  Burns, who has worked in management and never been in a union in his career, said he’s a sports fan and doesn’t object to professional sports unions that have helped athletes to earn millions.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re probably good for sports,” he said. “They were probably inevitable.”\n \n\n   \n    Will union effort spread to other teams?\n \n\n   \n  Haskins and Myrthil said they hope the victory of the union vote at Dartmouth will spark union votes on many other teams, including the big dollar programs. It will be an uphill fight, especially at many major sports programs that are most often found at state schools, not private schools, and are under different labor laws that can make organizing more difficult, depending on the state.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA has long sought to prohibit students from receiving any compensation for athletics, other than scholarships and some modest stipend money. But the Supreme Court opened the door for  greater compensation  for student athletes in 2021 when it ruled unanimously that NCAA rules prohibiting compensation to student athletes violated antitrust laws. The ruling opened the door for college athletes at the big money sports to start getting money from use of their  name, image and likeness , or NIL, in endorsement deals. But proposals to  allow direct pay  from the schools has yet to be approved by the NCAA.\n \n\n   \n  And the idea of union representation for college athletes was endorsed by a coach at least one major sports powerhouse. In a press conference soon after winning the college football championship, then-University of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said it was time for athletes to get a share of the wealth being produced by college sports, and that unions would be the way for that to happen. Michigan reported football revenue of $131 million in the most recent year to the Department of education.\n \n\n   \n  “And it’s long past time to let the student-athletes share in the ever-increasing revenues. I mean, it’s billions,” said Harbaugh, who has since taken a coaching position in the NFL. “And there needs to be a voice for the young people, the student-athletes. Right now, there is no voice… I have nothing against unions. That’s the next step, fellas. I think that’s the way you’ve got to go. That’s what I’d like to see change in college athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  But in all these cases, both in sports and with   campus jobs outside of sports, the students being asked to join a union movement are only going to be around for a limited number of years.\n \n\n   \n    Clock ticking on campus union fights\n \n\n   \n  An organizing drive can take a year, and a first contract can take longer than that. It’s not like trying to organize workers at a factory where the staff could be looking at long-term careers and expect to benefit from any contract that is reached.\n \n\n   \n  Another recently organized student union at Dartmouth is still seeking its first contract. The Graduate Organized Laborers of Dartmouth represents graduate teaching and research assistants. It is affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, one of the non-academic unions that has been very active in organizing in higher education.\n \n\n   \n  Logan Mann, a third-year graduate engineering student who is on GOLD-UE’s bargaining committee, said the initial organizing effort for the union started in fall of 2021, and that while it would have liked to have reached a contract already, they went into the effort knowing it could be a long fight.\n \n\n   \n  But that they had no choice, given their working reality, Mann said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re surrounded by so much wealth and don’t have any of it ourselves,” he said. “There’s a crushing cost of living and rent increases with no pay increases in sight.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though many union supporters will be graduating and leaving the school soon, he said the union is there for however long the fight for a contract takes.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an interesting challenge,” he said. “We have 25% turnover every year. The turnover, along with the fact that everyone will leave eventually means that our primary mission is one, to get a contract, and two is to develop future leaders in the union.”\n \n\n   \n   Update: This story was updated in October 2025, after one of the students interviewed in the story asked that her name be removed for personal reasons. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/asia/myanmar-starlink-scam-centers-spacex-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:23:00-04:00","title":"SpaceX disables thousands of Starlink devices being used by Myanmar scam centers","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink devices near scam centers in Myanmar, following reports that cyberfraud networks operating in the country's border regions have been using the satellite internet service to conduct large-scale online fraud.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:23 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink devices being used by cyber scam syndicates operating in a lawless corner of Myanmar, the   Elon Musk-led company said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite regional authorities’ highly publicized  crackdowns on the cyberfraud centers  along Myanmar’s border with Thailand this year, the scamming networks have continued to proliferate in the civil war-afflicted nation.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX said it works to identify violations in all markets where Starlink operates.\n \n\n   \n  “On the rare occasion we identify a violation, we take appropriate action, including working with law enforcement agencies around the world,” said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX’s vice president of business operations for Starlink, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “In Myanmar, for example, SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected ‘scam centers’.”\n \n\n   \n  Dreyer did not provide a date for when the consoles were disabled, but the announcement comes after the Myanmar military junta said it discovered 30 sets of Starlink “receivers and accessories” during a raid on one such scam compound this week.\n \n\n   \n  There are about 30 sprawling, purpose-built compounds dotted along the Myanmar-Thai border that are dedicated to scamming victims, including Americans, out of billions of dollars every year, according to  a recent report  by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Workers in the scam centers are often lured by the promise of well-paid jobs,  or trafficked, and are routinely held against their will and forced to carry out online fraud schemes in the heavily guarded compounds, where former detainees have  previously told CNN  beatings and torture are common.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, concerns have been raised by the United States that criminal networks in Myanmar were using Starlink to access the internet and carry out their scams.\n \n\n   \n  Starlink has more than 6 million global users, according to its website. It provides high-speed internet service using a network of thousands of satellites at low-Earth orbit, enabling it to reach remote communities.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the news agency Agence France-Presse this month found that Starlink receivers had been installed on the roofs of the scam compounds at a “huge scale.”\n \n\n   \n  The US Congress Joint Economic Committee has begun an investigation into Starlink’s alleged involvement in the centers, according to the AFP investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The move by SpaceX comes as the global scam industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, with criminal groups adopting  artificial intelligence  and using online cryptocurrency markets to move vast amounts of stolen money undetected.\n \n\n   \n  Southeast Asia is a hotspot for these romance or investment scams known as “pig butchering,” named for the practice of fattening up prey before the slaughter. And Myanmar has become an attractive destination for the cybercrime networks, who are shielded by corruption and the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  Since taking power in a 2021 coup, the military administration – which does not control all of the country – has fought a civil war against a patchwork of anti-junta and regional ethnic groups.\n \n\n   \n  In February, Thailand  cut electricity supplies  to several areas in Myanmar that are home to the scam sites, to try and disrupt their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, about 7,000 workers and victims  were released  from scam centers along the border and repatriated in a major operation by Thai authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Between January 30 and October 19, Myanmar’s military junta said it had arrested 9,551 foreign nationals from the scam compounds, repatriating most of them.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have warned that represents a tiny fraction of people trapped and working in the centers.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Monday its raid on KK Park, a notorious scam compound near the country’s southeastern Myawaddy border town, uncovered more than 2,000 workers.\n \n\n   \n  Footage filmed for CNN from inside KK Park in April shows paved roads lined with trees and manicured lawns, giving the image of a legitimate business district, complete with a hotel and billboards advertising gambling sites.\n \n\n   \n  But a source who works in the anti-human-trafficking field told CNN the raid on KK Park has not stopped operations.\n \n\n   \n  While the impact of ceasing Starlink operations “is not nothing,” there were still “many victims trapped inside” other buildings of the compound   who “confirmed last night they’re still being forced to scam,” said the source.\n \n\n   \n  Transnational crime expert Jason Tower said the military raid on KK Park was “more of a publicity stunt than a crackdown” and that it was “business as usual” for dozens of scam compounds still operating along the Moei River that separates Myanmar and Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  “With international attention and outrage over Southeast Asia’s scamdemic rising, the Myanmar military is trying to skirt accountability for transforming the Myanmar-Thailand border lands into a hub for criminality,” said Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n \n\n   \n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations meets for a summit later this week in Malaysia, and the scourge of scam centers is likely to be a top issue on the agenda. “The military is also trying to position itself as continuing to take action on this issue,” Tower said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive  law enforcement operation  by the US and UK that recently targeted a Cambodian criminal scam network “likely pushed China to increase pressure once again on the Myanmar military regime to take further action,” Tower added.\n \n\n   \n  “It is also likely that the Myanmar military seeks to establish more direct control over some of the scam centers, as it realizes just how much illicit revenue is being brought in by this extremely lucrative form of criminal activity,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the military junta for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"White House Releases List of Donors for Trump’s Multi-Million-Dollar Ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House has released a list of donors contributing to President Donald Trump’s proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which Trump claims is privately funded and costs taxpayers nothing.

Other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the University of Arizona declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and seven schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter addressed to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, University of Arizona President Suresh Garimella said, “We seek no special treatment and believe in our ability to compete for federally funded research strictly on merit.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Arizona’s refusal comes after the University of Virginia rejected the offer after a meeting at the White House on Friday. UVA has since reached a separate agreement with the administration aimed at ending federal investigations into admissions practices and civil rights.\n \n\n   \n  The Universities of Southern California and Pennsylvania, Brown University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Vanderbilt University and the University of Texas at Austin have said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an  unprecedented level of control over universities  – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, the   University of Kansas and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with those of Vanderbilt, Dartmouth, Texas at Austin, Arizona and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements. Harvard University is the only university to take on the White House directly in court, and while the school has had some judicial victories, the Trump administration continues to seek new and creative ways to apply pressure to the school.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  In declining the offer, University of Arizona President Garimella said, “We have much common ground with the ideas your administration is advancing on changes that would benefit American higher education and our nation at large.” But, “a federal research funding system based on anything other than merit would weaken the world’s preeminent engine for innovation, advancement of technology, and solutions to many of our nation’s most profound challenges.”\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College declined the offer Saturday morning. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock maintained the school needs to set its own policies according to its mission and values, she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a compact—with any administration—is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves, and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas,” Beilock said.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  last week, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, the school reached  a separate agreement  with the Trump administration. ﻿UVA agreed to a Justice Department mandate that it end what the Trump administration cast as unlawful racial discrimination in its programming, admissions and hiring.\n \n\n   \n  Importantly, the deal does not include a monetary settlement, and UVA will not have an outside monitor overseeing compliance. In return, the Trump administration will pause ongoing investigations into UVA on admissions practices and civil rights.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education on Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Education Secretary McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n  Vanderbilt University Chancellor Daniel Diermeier rejected reports that the Nashville university had been asked to accept or reject the compact. “We have been asked to provide feedback and comments as part of an ongoing dialogue, and that is our intention,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that “academic freedom, free expression and independence are essential for universities to make their vital and singular contributions to society.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. Officials didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/france-louvre-director-heist-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"03:42:00-04:00","title":"No security cameras covered Louvre balcony where thieves entered, director says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris experienced a major heist on October 1, 2025, when thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to enter the Apollo Gallery through a gap on the eastern balcony, which was not monitored by any security cameras due to the camera's orientation.

Nicholls, and Hilary Whiteman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:42 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  No security cameras were monitoring the second-floor balcony where thieves gained access to the Louvre to steal historic  jewels worth over $100 million , the museum’s director told a French Senate committee hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Laurence des Cars told senators Wednesday that the eastern balcony of the Apollo Gallery, where  robbers broke into the building on Sunday  using an angle grinder, was not covered by the museum’s aging camera system.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, on the Apollo Gallery side, the only camera installed faces west and therefore does not cover the balcony affected by the break-in,” des Cars told the hearing, as French investigators raced to recover the stolen jewels.\n \n\n   \n  Four days after the heist, investigators are yet to publicly identify any suspects as experts warned the  jewels were likely to be dismantled for their raw materials , destroying artifacts dating back to the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  The ease with which thieves gained access to the building – during opening hours via a truck-mounted ladder – has shocked the nation and raised questions about the vulnerability of the country’s museums to criminals deploying new tactics.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars told the hearing that the “absolutely obsolete, even absent, technical infrastructure” to monitor the country’s most valuable treasures was a “terrible observation” for the world’s largest museum. She said she’d offered her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati after the robbery, but it was rejected.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars, who took the role in 2021, said the museum’s weakness lies in the lack of perimeter protection, which she said was a result of “chronic underinvestment in equipment and infrastructure.”\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre’s last major renovation was in the 1980s under former French President François Mitterrand, who commissioned Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei to design an entrance befitting the historic venue.\n \n\n   \n  The glass pyramid that now forms the entrance to the museum opened to the public in 1989, putting a modern face on a storied institution known for its exhibition of the world’s finest art.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars said that renovation project may have created an illusion of momentum behind the museum being fully modernized. However, she said: “This major modernization project is now 40 years old, with facilities that have outperformed and are at the end of their tether.”\n \n\n   \n    How it happened\n \n\n   \n  The heist unfolded at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday when robbers parked a truck with a mobile ladder outside the gallery. At 9:34 a.m. they triggered an alarm on the second-floor door, which sent a signal to a security post.\n \n\n   \n  A security officer inside the auditorium radioed to report an intrusion and staff began evacuating members of the public. Alarms on two high-security display cases were triggered as the thieves cut holes in the glass to grab the jewels.  At 9:36 a.m. police were called. A minute later, a message was broadcast requesting that the doors be closed. By 9.38 a.m. the thieves had left the building.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance teams outside the museum prevented the suspects from setting their vehicle alight but could not prevent their escape on scooters along the banks of the Seine. A law enforcement official said investigators combed the truck for any traces of DNA. One of the two scooters had been retrieved as well as a helmet worn by one of the suspects, the official added.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars said Wednesday the security system inside the Apollo Gallery “worked perfectly” – but that it was designed several years ago to protect against the greatest risks of that time. For example, the high-security display cases that housed the jewels were designed to withstand bullets.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, this was the dominant modus operandi for this type of attack, for precious objects, jewelry, attacks in jewelry stores,” des Cars said. “That’s what the Louvre is protecting itself against.”\n \n\n   \n  She said what’s needed now is to adapt the system to a  “new type of attack, to new operating methods that had not been envisaged.” \n \n\n   \n  The theft had “profoundly shocked” the museum’s staff, French citizens and “all those who love the Louvre,” des Cars said.\n \n\n   \n  She suggested measures that could be put in place to enhance the museum’s security, such as fortifying the outer edges of the Louvre and prohibiting cars from parking in the vicinity.  Des Cars said she’s also considering whether it would be possible to install a police station inside the museum.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/asia/south-korea-president-lee-jae-myung-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-04:00","title":"South Korea’s President Downplays US Trade Rift and Welcomes Trump as ‘Peacemaker’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung downplays tensions with the United States during a CNN interview, welcoming incoming U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential peacemaker in efforts to achieve dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea.

risk, reiterating the need to pursue peace and dialogue – and raised the possibility of Trump bridging the gap between the two Koreas.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope that (Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un) will be able to engage in dialogue,” he said. “I also believe that President Trump wants to achieve world peace, and that is why I have made the recommendation for him to take on the role of a peacemaker.”\n \n\n   \n  While the chances that  Trump will meet Kim  during his multi-stop visit to Asia later this month remain low, Lee said it would be “a good thing” if the “leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump met Kim  several times during his first term , holding landmark summits that ultimately failed to produce a meaningful breakthrough. But earlier this summer in a White House meeting with Lee, the US president said he was  willing to meet Kim again .\n \n\n   \n  Trump is also expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping next week when South Korea hosts the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit  in Gyeongju, attended by leaders and delegations from across the region.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said as recently as Friday that he intends to meet Xi on the sidelines of the key summit, though it’s not clear where or when this will happen. Tensions remain high between  the two rival powers , after another trade spat and slew of tariff threats.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea has always walked a fine line in navigating its relationships with the US and China. Seoul and Washington have been staunch allies for more than seven decades – drawing closer in recent years in a joint effort to combat growing Chinese influence in the Asia-Pacific region. South Korea is also home to the US military’s largest overseas base, which houses 41,000 people including troops and their families.\n \n\n   \n  But South Korea and China have also maintained a strong trading relationship.\n \n\n   \n  “We have different ideologies and also a different system of government … (but) we cannot shut out China,” Lee said, adding that the “vital” US alliance made managing the China relationship “a bit delicate.”\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to relationships between countries, you cannot cut it clean with a knife and say: ‘This country is our friend, and this country is not.’ It’s just not that simple – it’s much more complicated and complex,” said Lee.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambitions and growing capabilities in high-tech industries present a challenge to South Korea, long seen as a global leader in such critical sectors.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that Chinese companies were catching up with (and in some cases overtaking) South Korean ones, Lee said there remained “many areas where Korean firms can win,” such as semiconductors and automobiles.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea is   committed to sharing this expertise with the US too, Lee said, emphasizing their bilateral relationship included economic, technological, and military cooperation.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past we have received a lot of assistance from the United States, and so we are willing to provide assistance for the US’ efforts to  revamp its manufacturing industry  to the extent possible,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  His tone was notably warm, despite the US-South Korea relationship being strained in recent months by Trump’s immigration crackdown. Nearly  500 people , mostly Korean nationals, were arrested and detained during an ICE raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia last month, sparking outrage back home. The car maker is one of South Korea’s largest companies.\n \n\n   \n  After the detainees were flown back to South Korea, Trump posted online that he didn’t want to “frighten off or disincentivize investment into America by outside countries or companies.”\n \n\n   \n  South Korea has also had to contend with Trump’s tariff demands, which came as the country was dealing with the fallout from Lee’s predecessor  briefly declaring martial law , then cycling through a revolving door of interim leaders as the economy spluttered.\n \n\n   \n  In late July, barely a month into his tenure, Lee  negotiated a trade deal  with the Trump administration to avert high tariffs on Korean exports, including a $350 billion investment flow from South Korea to the US. But detailed negotiations have dragged out, leaving the country’s key auto making industry at a disadvantage – subject to 25% US tariffs while its rivals in Japan and Europe have already secured much lower rates.\n \n\n   \n  Lee acknowledged there are “differences in opinion” between South Korea and the US in the ongoing talks, but said he believed “that eventually we will get there because the United States is the leading country when it comes to the values of democracy and the free market system.”\n \n\n   \n  Some critics have slammed Trump’s tariff demands as extortionate – especially for longtime allies and friends like South Korea. When asked what he thought of this, Lee simply laughed.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that we will, in the end, be able to reach a rational result that can be acceptable,” he said, smiling.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-potential-230-million-doj-payment-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:34:00.000Z","title":"Trump’s potential $230 million DOJ payment would be astonishing — even for him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump is reportedly seeking $230 million in damages from the Department of Justice over alleged rights violations during the Russia investigation and the classified documents probe, which were filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

for him \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:34 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The idea of a president convincing his own Justice Department to furnish him with nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in taxpayer cash seems too absurd to take seriously.\n \n\n   \n  Putting aside unfathomable ethical implications, such a move would be one of the most glaring examples of a political tin ear in modern times, as many Americans struggle to pay rent or buy groceries.\n \n\n   \n  For this reason, there must be a good chance that  Donald Trump’s reported claims for damages  over the DOJ’s past investigations into his conduct is a step too far even for him.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has often fashioned a new normality with his outlandish moves. His life in business and politics has been one long and lucrative attempt to apply leverage for personal or financial gain and to sate his thirst for payback. In an inverted political world, where he’s destroyed curbs that constrain presidents and turned the DOJ into a boutique personal law firm, the notion of a bumper personal payout cannot be immediately dismissed as a fantasy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump declined the chance to do so himself in the Oval Office Tuesday after  the New York Times  reported on the claims. While he initially seemed hazy on details of the two claims, he didn’t rule anything out,  saying they “could be”  something he’d pursue.\n \n\n   \n  And in his unique way, in which he sometimes seems more like a commentator on his own presidency than its perpetrator, he put his finger on what makes this situation so bizarre — without apparently computing why people are worried about the idea. “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself,” the president mused before his political antennae kicked in and he pledged to donate any money he might get to charity.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has often described himself as the nation’s top legal officer, he wouldn’t in theory have the final say on the matter. That would fall to officials including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. But since Blanche is Trump’s former personal lawyer, that distinction may not matter very much.\n \n\n   \n  A full 24 hours after the Times story broke, there was still no full on-the-record denial from the White House. The complaints were filed as an administrative claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act — a first step to see whether a settlement is possible before someone can sue for damages. The Times reported Trump was seeking $230 million in total compensation in claims filed before his reelection over alleged rights violations in the Russia investigation during his first term and the probe into his alleged hoarding of classified documents.  CNN previously reported on that claim , which sought $100 million. Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump or his 2016 campaign conspired with Russia. The classified documents case was dropped when Trump won the 2024 election on the grounds that presidents cannot be prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n    One word that rarely worries the White House: ethics\n \n\n   \n  Trump would face multiple political and ethical hurdles if he decided to push his claims to a conclusion. The role of Blanche — who acted for the president and presumably billed him for his services in the classified documents case — is only one of the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  To begin with, the symbolism of a billionaire president lining his pockets with taxpayer money would be jarring, especially when  the government is shut down , thousands of essential workers are showing up without pay and  nutrition benefits for needy Americans  are in danger of running out.\n \n\n   \n  “Particularly right now, we’re talking about a quarter of a billion dollars transferring, maybe, to the president when we’re in a shutdown posture, so it’s at very best bad timing, but I think it’s horrible optics,” said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who is more prone to speaking out than many of his Trump-fearing colleagues since he’s not seeking reelection.\n \n\n   \n  Even a Democratic Party that has struggled to pin down Trump with an effective counteroffensive could surely make hay with such a spectacle, especially amid a shutdown they triggered  over high health care costs . Trump would risk a voter backlash in testing economic times. A CBS News poll earlier this month found that the economy, jobs and inflation were top concerns. Some 75% thought Trump wasn’t focusing enough on the price of goods and services at a time when he’s threatening to send troops into US cities, conducting  lethal strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats  on the oceans, and pursuing personal vanity  architectural projects .\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump has never shown great concern about reaching beyond his political base. And many of his voters share his view that he was persecuted by the Justice Department, despite substantial evidence of wrongdoing — which the president denied — and two grand jury indictments. He’s often proved he’s got more leeway than many pundits think.\n \n\n   \n  “Taxpayers pay for a lot of things … about $2 trillion more than they should every year,” Trump loyalist and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Wednesday. “But I hope they work it out. And I know the president is just trying to put pressure on the DOJ, to say, ‘Listen, this was wrongly done.’”\n \n\n   \n    An increasingly profligate administration\n \n\n   \n  Any decision to pay Trump would underscore the president’s felling of the traditional wall between the White House and Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Normally, the officials involved might be expected to recuse themselves. But the fate of Jeff Sessions, the Trump first-term attorney general who recused himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation — and bought himself  a ticket out of the administration  — offers a cautionary tale. And can there be any expectation that Blanche or Attorney General Pam Bondi would risk their jobs to defy Trump after multiple examples of Justice Department obedience to a president who is using the  machinery of government  to pursue his  political enemies ?\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s one more example where Donald Trump is using the Justice Department as his private playground, trying to fleece his pockets,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday. “He’s just going to just see if his puppets that he put in that Justice Department are going to perform for him … he doesn’t think they should conflict themselves out. Perhaps they will. But he deliberately put his personal lawyers in there.”\n \n\n   \n  If Trump did snag a big payout from the DOJ, he’d exacerbate criticisms that he’s using his post to  boost his personal and familial wealth , despite his past vows to “drain the swamp.” Democrats have complained that Trump and his clan made hundreds of millions of dollars in a  cryptocurrency boom  unleashed by his government’s friendly policies toward the industry. The US has meanwhile taken delivery of  a jumbo jet from Qatar  that he plans to use for his new Air Force One and that raised massive ethics concerns, given the Gulf nation’s role in US foreign policy. And first lady Melania Trump will feature in a  big-budget Amazon documentary .\n \n\n   \n  A DOJ award to the president would be the latest example of an administration increasingly willing to throw huge amounts of money at its pet projects while slashing government programs.  The Washington Post reported  last week that the Coast Guard plans to spend an estimated total of $200 million on two private jets to be used by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top officials. And Trump is planning a  $20 billion bailout of Argentina , conditional on voters supporting his populist friend and MAGA hero President Javier Milei.\n \n\n   \n  A huge Justice Department payout to Trump might top all that. But surely, given all the political liabilities and ethical nightmares, he wouldn’t go ahead.\n \n\n   \n  Or would he? Before this week, no one can have imagined that the wrecking-ball president would have demolished a beloved part of the White House, without consulting the people, the true owners of the home where he’s just a temporary resident.\n \n\n   \n  But the historic ghosts of elegant quarters once graced by Jacqueline Kennedy now lay buried in the  rubble of the East Wing , before Trump’s vast new ballroom rises — a kind of Mar-a-Lago on the Potomac.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/ukraine-sweden-gripen-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00-04:00","title":"Ukraine Could Get 150 Advanced Swedish Fighter Jets Under Just-Signed Deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine has entered into a letter of understanding with Sweden to receive up to 150 advanced Saab Gripen-E fighter jets, marking the first major fighter jet offer from a NATO member to Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion.

just-signed deal \n       \n  By Brad Lendon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:49 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New NATO member Sweden has said it is willing to sell Ukraine up to 150 of its most advanced fighter jets, the first offer from a member of the alliance to supply significant numbers of jets to Kyiv, which is seeking to upgrade its small and ageing air force.\n \n\n   \n  The deal signed on Wednesday by Volodymyr Zelensky and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson is a letter of understanding, meaning exact terms, costs and delivery dates for 100 to 150 Saab Gripen-E jets are yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  But both leaders said it has the potential to be a game changer, not only for Ukraine –   which desperately needs more air combat capabilities in its fight against Russia – but for NATO and European security overall.\n \n\n   \n  “We are opening an entirely new and truly meaningful chapter in our relations — relations between Ukraine and Sweden, and more broadly, overall security relations in Europe,” Zelensky in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “These are very cool planes, powerful aviation platforms that allow for performing a wide range of tasks,” Zelensky said.\n \n\n   \n  “This will strengthen both Ukraine, Sweden and Europe,” Kristersson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Sweden joined NATO in 2024 along with its Nordic neighbor Finland. Their accession to the alliance – which ended longstanding policies of non-alignment – was spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Fighter jets have been a critical need for Ukraine since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of its neighbor. At the time, Ukraine’s air force consisted largely of Soviet-era aircraft. While Western countries have come to Kyiv’s aid with older US-made F-16 models as well as a handful of French Mirages, those have not been enough to counter Russian air superiority.\n \n\n   \n  But the Gripen-E is considered by experts to be well-suited to operating conditions in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Gripen fighters have the reputation of being relatively cheap and easy to maintain and arm, and able to operate in austere conditions – using roads or even dirt roads for runways.\n \n\n   \n  While the first version of the jet dates to the late 1980s, the E model just entered service with the Swedish Air Force earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Gripen-E models have so many upgrades that they are “in many respects a new aircraft type,” with new radar and communication systems, better sensors and the ability to deploy new weapons, the Swedish Armed Forces said in a release at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Manufacturer Saab calls the single-engine Gripen-E “the game changer” with the ability to network sensors and coordinate missile launches among the fleet. At the same time, the jets have embedded AI capability, Saab says.\n \n\n   \n  Each jet has 10 “hard points” to attach missiles that can strike other air and ground targets.\n \n\n   \n  The Gripen-E will be familiar to pilots who have flown earlier models, it said.\n \n\n   \n  That could become important as Ukrainian pilots have tested and trained on older Gripen jets and simulators, the communications chief for Ukraine’s air force said Wednesday in  a report from RBC-Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  With that training, some observers have raised the possibility of Ukraine getting older Gripen models to tide them over until the E models arrive in about three years.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Zelensky told a press conference in Sweden that he hoped his country could receive and start using the Gripens next year.\n \n\n   \n  “For our army, Gripens are a priority,” he said,  according to Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  If the deal is completed with 150 jets eventually going to Ukraine, Kyiv could become the top operator of the Gripen-E worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  Besides Sweden, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand fly Gripens.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement came just days after Zelensky’s attempt to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles to use in strikes deep into Russia was rebuffed by US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Wednesday that one of the reasons he denied Zelensky’s request is that Tomahawks require a long training period.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with the Tomahawk that a lot of people don’t know, it’ll take a minimum of six months, usually a year, to learn how to use them. They’re highly complex,” Trump said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/middleeast/analysis-trump-bibisitting-netanyahu-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Trump’s babysitting of Netanyahu puts the US in charge on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a dramatic reversal of a decades-old political metaphor, the United States—under President Donald Trump—is now acting as the 'Bibi-sitter' to ensure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complies with the Gaza ceasefire deal.

This marks a shift from previous U.S. solidarity visits to active management and micromanagement of Israel’s war strategy, raising concerns among Israeli military and political leaders about erosion of sovereignty. While Netanyahu and U.S. officials deny the existence of a 'client state,' critics like Yair Lapid argue that such close control undermines Israeli independence, especially given the far-right coalition’s resistance to peace. The situation is further complicated by a military clash in Rafah, a temporary suspension of humanitarian aid, and unresolved challenges in defining post-war governance.

of Netanyahu puts the US in charge on Gaza \n       \n  Analysis by Tal Shalev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An American official called it “Bibi-sitting” – a revolving door of the highest-ranking members of the Trump administration to make sure Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , frequently known as “Bibi,” sticks to the US-brokered ceasefire deal.\n \n\n   \n  It flipped the narrative on a  decade-old campaign ad  in which Netanyahu was the “Bibi-sitter,” watching a couple’s children on a date night.\n \n\n   \n  Now it’s the US taking on that role, shuttling envoys, Cabinet members and even the president to ensure the implementation of the nascent Gaza ceasefire agreement.\n \n\n   \n  In short, the “Bibi-sitter” has become the babysat.\n \n\n   \n  In the span of just two weeks, an extraordinary parade of top US officials has descended on Israel in a diplomatic blitz.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump launched the charm offensive, visiting Israel last week to oversee the signing of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Then, on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance landed at Ben Gurion airport to monitor the deal’s implementation. On Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to arrive as well. Meanwhile, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff have conducted multiple missions to Israel, shaping and forging the agreement into a diplomatic reality.\n \n\n   \n  High-level American visits to Israel during times of crisis are not unprecedented – President Joe Biden rushed to Tel Aviv days after October 7, 2023, in a powerful solidarity visit, warning Israel’s enemies not to get involved, with his Secretary of State Antony Blinken following multiple times. But those visits were more about solidarity and deterrence; Trump’s are about management and compliance. This United States is not merely mediating the Gaza ceasefire – it is actively managing it.\n \n\n   \n  “We intend to stay engaged every single day to make sure peace takes hold,” Vance said at a news conference on Tuesday, unveiling a new US coordination center to monitor and assess real-time developments of the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n \n\n   \n  “The event is being managed by an external entity, by the Americans, and this is a very problematic matter,” former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen Gadi Eisenkot told Israel’s Kan Radio on Tuesday. “As we progress with the agreement, more international forces will enter, and this will limit the IDF.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington’s micromanagement of the deal’s implementation underscores its determination for the ceasefire to succeed. The Trump administration is spending an incredible amount of political capital to force the ceasefire to survive its first few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But it also reflects concern about the intent of Netanyahu’s political partners. His far-right allies have opposed an end to the war and called for a complete occupation of Gaza. Netanyahu was able to get the first phase of the deal through, including the return of the hostages in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n \n\n   \n  The second phase is far more challenging: defining post-war governance and security forces in Gaza, as well as establishing what roles the Palestinian Authority, Arab states and other international stakeholders will play.\n \n\n   \n  The fragility of the truce was exposed earlier this week, after a military clash in Rafah in which two Israeli soldiers were killed. Jerusalem was quick to declare this a ceasefire violation. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich tweeted one word: “War.” Israel carried out strikes across Gaza that killed more than 40 Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday afternoon, Netanyahu announced a suspension of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. But he reversed course two hours later under American pressure, according to an Israeli source with knowledge of the matter. Three days later, Vance said there would be “inevitable skirmishes,” but that the ceasefire would last.\n \n\n   \n  The post‑war phase also marks a recalibration of regional roles. Despite deep Israeli skepticism, Turkey and Qatar are central to Washington’s framework for reconstruction and mediation in Gaza. Vance stated pointedly in Jerusalem that “what troops are on the ground in Israel – or Gaza – is for Israelis to approve,” even as he praised Ankara and Doha for their “constructive” influence.\n \n\n   \n  “The rules of the game are being written while we speak, but it’s already clear that the US is calling the shots and Israel is playing by its rules,” Amos Harel, Haaretz’s senior military analyst, told CNN. “Netanyahu will never admit it, but to a large extent, Israel mortgaged some of its independence, with US generals controlling the wheel.”\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military is accustomed to incredibly close cooperation with the US, which has been on full display repeatedly throughout the war. But Harel says this is more than cooperation – it is management. “The Israeli military leadership does not necessarily like to have another authority hovering over their head,” he told CNN. But the military, whose chief of staff pushed to accept an earlier ceasefire, understands it’s the only way to end the war.\n \n\n   \n  “The US track, even if it’s full of holes, is the way to get there,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This dynamic is reflected in the Trump administration’s repeated interventions in Israel’s strategic decisions over the past several months. In June, Trump ordered the Israeli Air Force to recall jets en route to a strike on Iranian targets. In September, he forced an apology to Qatar after a failed strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Days later, he publicly instructed Israel to halt aerial operations in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  For some Israeli observers and politicians, the magnitude of American involvement could entrench the perception that Israel is dependent on US permission, eroding its sovereignty and freedom to apply force. “Netanyahu has single-handedly turned us into a protectorate, which accepts dictates regarding its security,” opposition leader Yair Lapid charged on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu rejected the criticism. Standing alongside Vance in Jerusalem on Wednesday, he said the idea that Israel is an American client state is “hogwash.”\n \n\n   \n  “One week they say Israel controls the US, a week later they say the US controls Israel,” he said sarcastically. Vance echoed his position, saying, “We don’t want a vassal state, and that’s not what Israel is. We don’t want a client state and that’s not what Israel is. We want a partnership, we want an ally here.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Trump and Netanyahu have repeatedly declared they intend to push the Middle East beyond conflict management toward a renewed Abraham Accords expansion. It is the carrot that Trump has dangled in front of Netanyahu, and the White House is trying its best to will it into existence.\n \n\n   \n  But the main Israeli political barrier persists: how to reconcile the demand for a viable pathway for Palestinian statehood with Netanyahu’s hardline coalition. Here, the American babysitting might play to Netanyahu’s advantage – Trump’s pressure can provide him with domestic political cover and an excuse for concessions his coalition would never otherwise accept.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/ncaa-college-athletes-pro-sports-betting","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:32:00-04:00","title":"NCAA Allows College Athletes to Bet on Professional Sports Starting November 1","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA has approved a rule change allowing college athletes and athletic department staff to bet on professional sports, effective November 1, 2025.

campaign against alleged drug trafficking \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Rashard Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:46 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military conducted lethal strikes against two boats in the eastern Pacific this week, killing all people on board each vessel, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The two strikes on vessels in the Pacific — the eighth and ninth known strikes by the US military on alleged drug-smuggling vessels since the start of September — appear to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, with all seven previous strikes targeting boats in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  At least 37 people in total have been killed in the nine strikes, officials have said.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said on X Wednesday, noting a Tuesday strike in the Pacific had killed both people on board.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said the boat in that strike was “being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific” and “was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route, and carrying narcotics.”\n \n\n   \n  Later Wednesday, Hegseth said the US conducted a lethal strike on a second suspected drug boat in the eastern Pacific, killing all three people on board.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO),” Hegseth wrote in  the post. \n \n\n   \n  The secretary added that no US forces were hurt in the two Pacific strikes and compared the traffickers to al Qaeda.\n \n\n   \n  “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our

Jeff Merkley now holds the record for third longest Senate floor speech in modern history, after delivering remarks for more than 22 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Merkley began speaking on the Senate floor after announcing he would protest what he called  President Donald Trump ’s “grave threats to democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We’re in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” the Oregon Democrat, who turns 69 on Friday, said after kicking off his remarks at 6:24 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  In total, the senator spoke for 22 hours and 36 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after his remarks came to an end, Merkley told CNN’s Manu Raju that he almost fainted at one point and noted that he had been dehydrating himself since Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “It is about dehydration. My last sip of anything — well, I might have had a micro-sip – was breakfast on Monday morning on the plane. That was my last food too. And I wasn’t really sure that was going to work out, and I said, ‘I hope I’m not fasting for no reason.’ I love to eat,” said Merkley, later adding that he had a slice of pizza just off the floor.\n \n\n   \n  He said “there was one moment” where he thought he might faint, and noted that he had injured his back while running a few weeks ago. “My back hurt the whole damn time,” said Merkley.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about gallery staff and Capitol Police, who are working without pay during the shutdown, being forced to work through the night during his speech, Merkley said it was “outrageous” that there are no negotiations happening to end the shutdown, and noted, “having this speech tonight or not having this tonight isn’t going to speed up paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added that after he finished speaking, “I went around and thanked everybody who had been on the floor, including the pages, including the floor staff, including everybody, because I do realize it was such an imposition.” He said that he also thanked the Republicans in the chair for presiding over his speech.\n \n\n   \n   Senate rules do not permit lawmakers to take bathroom breaks or sit down without yielding their time – though there was a short interruption Wednesday at noon for the daily prayer and pledge before the senator began speaking again.\n \n\n   \n  Merkley’s marathon speech stands as a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as his party remains in a standoff with Republicans over health care subsidies amid the government shutdown. The shutdown is expected to drag on with the impasse entering a fourth week Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have so far held their position, blocking the GOP stopgap bill to reopen the government 12 times until their demands are met.\n \n\n   \n  The senator in his speech pointed to the Trump administration’s previous  halting of research grants  for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the  recent indictments  of several of the president’s political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there’s a rebellion. And if there’s a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Early Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  His comments on the situation in Oregon come after  an appeals court  on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court’s permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Democratic  Sen. Cory Booker  of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, warning against the harms he said the administration was inflicting on the American public. The effort broke the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  This was also not Merkley’s first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017  against Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court .\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris  Murphy  on gun control in 2016;  Rand Paul  over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and  Ted Cruz  against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This headline and story have been updated to reflect the record held by Sen.

The president has shown visitors two flat tabletop models, at times quizzing the room on which version they preferred: the smaller one or the larger one. Most answered that the bigger one was better, to which Trump agreed.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s not clear how much larger, Trump did say Wednesday that the ballroom is expected to cost a projected $300 million, seemingly in line with a larger structure. Previously, the administration had  put the cost at $200 million .\n \n\n   \n  The project has  drawn outcry  and led to questions about whether the president was within his legal authority to dismantle entire sections of the executive mansion. Not all of Trump’s own team was set on the project at the start, one source familiar with the internal conversations told CNN. At the beginning, some aides and advisers thought it was too big of a task to undertake, and attempted to explain how difficult and lengthy the process was likely to be. But once it became clear the president wasn’t going to give up on the idea — which he’s been musing about for the better part of 15 years — everyone quickly got onboard.\n \n\n   \n  The White House says it will submit plans for the ballroom construction to the National Capital Planning Commission, but insists the body doesn’t have purview over the decision to knock down the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  Some former members of the panel have questioned that assessment. And one of the nation’s premier historic preservation organizations is calling for an immediate halt to the leveling of the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  But there appeared little standing in the way of the president’s decision to move ahead with the audacious, multi-year project. Now  the demolition  is well underway, it seemed unlikely the plans would be reversed.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure,” Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office when questioned about the project. A scale model of the White House grounds — with the ballroom prominently jutting out from the East Colonnade — sat on the table in front of him.\n \n\n   \n  He said after a “tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world,” the determination was made of the East Wing that “really knocking it down” would be necessary.\n \n\n   \n  “It was never thought of as being much,” he said. “It was a very small building.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, track excavators continued their work ripping into the former home of the office of the first lady, the White House calligrapher and some military aides. The demolition was proceeding quickly, with roughly half the structure now reduced to a grey pile of cement and twisted rebar. Staffers in those departments have been relocated to other areas on the complex.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing’s wood-paneled foyer has long been the main point of entry for visitors attending social events at the White House, as well as those going on tours of the building. The section emerged in its current form in 1942.\n \n\n   \n  The rest of the East Wing is likely to be demolished by the end of the week, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways, the cries of disapproval are coming too late. Renderings released by the White House in July showed the ballroom sitting atop where the East Wing used to sit, and an  official press release  at the time stated it would sit “where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said anyone outraged or concerned he was taking steps without being frank about his intentions were misplaced.\n \n\n   \n  “I haven’t been transparent? I’ve shown this to everybody that would listen,” he said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Still, images of the building torn to pieces this week have caused shock, particularly as Trump tests his authority in nearly all aspects of the presidency — not least of which is the building he lives and works in.\n \n\n   \n  The project began ramping up over the summer, one source said, and weekly meetings to discuss the project began. The president himself has been involved in these meetings, which also have included Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, the White House Military Office, the Secret Service, an architecture team and other staffers internally who have been tasked with helping move the project along quickly, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House said in late July that McCrery Architects and its CEO James McCrery would take the lead in the design of the addition. A few days later, McCrery was spotted alongside Trump on the White House roof surveying the area on the South Grounds where the ballroom will go.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s aides were prepared for pushback on the ballroom and sought to review what was legally required to complete the project, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, administration officials determined the White House would only need approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal construction projects in Washington and its neighboring states, Virginia and Maryland. But officials said the commission has jurisdiction only when “vertical” construction begins, and does not oversee demolition.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently  appointed White House staff secretary and loyalist Will Scharf to chair the commission . White House deputy Chief of Staff James Blair and another Trump aide were also appointed to the commission at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  Scharf said during a meeting of the commission last month the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The commission, which is closed amid the ongoing government shutdown, was created by Congress in 1924 and is comprised of 12 members. Three are appointed by the president, along with the chairman, with the rest of the seats reserved for federal agencies, such as the National Park Service, and representatives from the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  Projects reviewed by the NCPC in recent years include changing the perimeter fence around the White House grounds and a tennis pavilion Trump installed during his first term. The fence, in particular, took several years before it was ultimately approved; officials said it was a necessary change because people kept jumping over the previous one and running toward the North Portico.\n \n\n   \n  L. Preston Bryant Jr., who served as chairman of the NCPC for nearly a decade, described a three-stage process that typically unfolds for federal projects, beginning with early consultations that he described as collaborative.\n \n\n   \n  “The Commission staff very much wants a potential project to get started on the right foot. This early consultation stage is very important,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The project goes through subsequent phases — conceptional, preliminary approval and final approval — before the process is complete.\n \n\n   \n  Bryant said he couldn’t remember a time when demolition was separated from the approval process in the way the Trump White House has done.\n \n\n   \n  “That was not my experience during my time at NCPC,” Bryant said. “If there’s to be demolition, that’s part of the project. The demolition element is inherent in the overall project. Demo is not separated from construction. It’s part of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Rebecca Miller, the executive director of the DC Preservation League, said demolishing the East Wing before a formal submission of the ballroom plans essentially starts the project before a formal review process.\n \n\n   \n  “Most concerning is that they’re just tearing down the East Wing without any public submission as to what is going to be built in its place,” she said. “And that’s where the National Capital Planning Commission, or the Commission on Fine Arts, or the public, would have their input into the design of the property, its compatibility with the White House, and how to mitigate or minimize the impact on the current historic resource.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this kind of zone where there’s nothing that prevents the demolition, but we’ve also not seen what the submission is,” Miller added.\n \n\n   \n  Other laws and rules also appear not to apply to the White House. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the  National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 , which details the process by which stakeholders should be brought in for large public projects. But the law excludes the three pillars of US government – the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the White House — from its provisions.\n \n\n   \n  The  Shipstead-Luce Act of 1930  also requires that alterations to buildings in the national capital area, including the White House, must be presented to the Commission of Fine Arts. The language, however, refers to buildings facing the White House and not the White House itself.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the concerns about the new ballroom appear unconvincing. Sitting in the newly gilded Oval Office as the machines were working away outside, he held up a pile of paper renderings showing the plans, including the Louis XIV-style interior that closely resembles the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “You see it goes beautifully with the White House,” Trump proclaimed. “I mean, the mix is beautiful.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/cars/gm-self-driving-tech","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"GM to Introduce 'Eyes-Off' Driving Technology in 2028","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"General Motors, the 100-year-old automaker, is announcing its plan to introduce 'eyes-off' driving technology in 2028, beginning with the Cadillac Escalade IQ SUV.

  \n  By Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:58 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  General Motors, the 100-year-old car company that has struggled with its expensive modernization efforts, plans to offer Americans hands-free driving and the freedom to watch a movie on the go.\n \n\n   \n  The company unveiled new “eyes-off” driving technology that will be available starting in 2028, part of a new technology initiative revealed by GM executives in New York Wednesday. The automaker said the initiative includes a conversational AI technology that will be introduced into   vehicles next year.\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine you step into your vehicle, you push a button, and it drives you to the office. You catch up on work, send emails, or watch an episode of your favorite show,”   said GM CEO Mary Barra. “The car drops you off … then it goes to get your dry cleaning, take out for dinner, and it comes back in time so you can drive your kids to their soccer game.”\n \n\n   \n  The version of the future imagined and described by Barra is years away, but in three years GM is promising the “eyes-off” driving experience will be available in their Cadillac Escalade IQ SUV.\n \n\n   \n  This year GM will take a $1.6 billion hit to their electric vehicle business because of government policy changes and the termination of consumer EV tax credits. GM has poured tens of billions of dollars into their EV fleets but has struggled attracting like-minded consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “Customers want immersive tech in their vehicles and to stay connected wherever they go. We’re drawing from our rich heritage, our design, our engineering, our manufacturing expertise, and we’re doing something entirely new,” said Barra.\n \n\n   \n  This technology may be new for General Motors, but it’s far from the first car company to release this type of tech. Stellantis, Tesla, and Waymo already have driverless cars on the road. (Stellantis – along with Mercedes and Volkswagen – also have conversational AI capabilities.)\n \n\n   \n  No company has yet achieved wide-scale commercialization of self-driving cars, so GM believes an opportunity for leadership still exists. But it has a tremendous amount of ground to make up.\n \n\n   \n  “When we launch this, we’ll see what happens. We may be the first to have a personally owned self-driving vehicle that works, that’s safe and that’s important. I don’t view it as catchup. I view it as leapfrog,” said Sterling Anderson, Chief Product Officer at GM.\n \n\n   \n  Barra and GM’s President Mark Reuss, who both began their careers at General Motors in the 1980’s, presided over Wednesday’s unveiling. They were joined by Anderson, who started six months ago and previously worked at Tesla, and Dave Richardson, the company’s SVP of Software Engineering, who joined almost two years ago from Apple.\n \n\n   \n  “The juxtaposition on stage is not an accident, (it’s) stark,” Anderson said of his Tesla background.\n \n\n   \n  Both hirings reflect that General Motors – the car company – must be a technology-first company to compete.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just sort of a recognition that the company does need to get more technology forward and focused. But that just takes a little bit of time for people to get on the same page,” Richardson said.\n \n\n   \n  Time is not on GM’s side. Cars from Chinese companies like BYD and Zeekr are rapidly gaining market share in Europe due to their lower prices and technology-forward designs. A 100% US tariff on Chinese cars has kept them out of the US market.\n \n\n   \n  But if that changes, those companies could present a real challenge for GM. But Reuss thinks GMs offerings can compete.\n \n\n   \n   “It’s not going to be taking apart Chinese cars and copying Chinese cars,” said Reuss. ”We went through technology investment and R&D and we’ll continue to do that and we have got to be the best, period. I think that wins with the customer.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/us/sonya-massey-shooting-trial-sean-grayson","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:48:00Z","title":"Sheriff’s Deputy ‘Got Mad’ and Fatalily Shot Sonya Massey Without Justification, Prosecutor Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In July 2024, 36-year-old Black woman Sonya Massey was fatally shot by Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson in her Springfield, Illinois home during a confrontation over a pot of hot water she removed from the stove.

deputy ‘got mad’ and fatally shot Sonya Massey without justification, prosecutor says \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:48 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The Illinois sheriff’s deputy who killed  Sonya Massey  in her Springfield home last year eschewed his training and the principles of policing when he shot the Black woman who had called 911 for help, a prosecutor said Wednesday in Sean Grayson’s murder trial.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, who is white, faces three counts of first-degree murder for  shooting the 36-year-old single mother  on July 6, 2024, during a confrontation over her handling of a pot of hot water she removed from her stove.\n \n\n   \n  The jury watched unedited  body camera video  of the encounter, prompting some jurors to recoil and cover their mouths while Grayson looked down for much of it. Massey’s mother left the courtroom in tears.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser told the jury that the video would show Massey posed no threat when Grayson and fellow Sangamon County Sheriff’s Deputy Dawson Farley entered her home. Massey, who had mental health problems, had called 911 about a suspected prowler.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s a little scattered, but she’s nice and kind and talking to him and you’ll see that interaction,” Milhiser said during opening statements. “You will see what happens when the defendant gets mad at a woman who is in her kitchen and has called for help. He gets mad and shoots and kills her without lawful justification.”\n \n\n   \n  “He did not follow his training. He did not follow police principles.”\n \n\n   \n  Grayson’s attorney, Daniel Fultz, told the jury that when Massey approached with the pot of water, Grayson repeatedly demanded she put it down before “making a decision no police officer wants to make.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Massey lifted the pot of water above her head and the evidence will show that the use of force was reasonable under the circumstances without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight,” Fultz said. “What happened to Ms. Massey was a tragedy, but it was not a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  The killing has prompted continued questions about US law enforcement shootings of  Black people in their home s  and generated a change in  Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, 31, has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of murder, he faces 45 years to life in prison. Prosecutors dismissed single counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and Farley had entered Massey’s home to report they had found no suspicious activity when Grayson noticed the pan on the stove and ordered it removed.\n \n\n   \n  The body camera video shows Grayson and Massey joking about how the deputy backed away as she moved the pot before Massey said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Grayson later told sheriff’s investigators he thought Massey’s statement  meant she intended to kill him . He yelled at her to drop the pot. In the subsequent commotion, he fired three shots,  striking her just below the eye .\n \n\n   \n  Farley testified that he drew his weapon after Grayson did because department policy calls for a deputy to do so when a partner does.\n \n\n   \n  “She just never did or said anything that made me think she was a threat,” Farley said. “Looking across the room and seeing my partner draw his gun — it was the defendant’s actions that made me have a heightened sense of awareness.”\n \n\n   \n  Under Fultz’s questioning, Farley acknowledged that his initial report days after the shooting claimed he feared for his safety from the hot water and that Massey held the pot chest high. Farley said that after Grayson was indicted he sought to amend his statement to the Illinois State Police to “clarify” that it was Grayson’s response, not the hot water, that rattled him and that it was an oven mitt, not the pot, that Massey held chest-high.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Farley was serving a one-year probationary period and subject to firing for any reason. He said his union representative advised against further state police contact.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Illinois State Police Lt. Eric Weston, a crime scene investigator, told defense attorney Mark Wykoff that he collected two shell casings from Grayson’s 9 mm pistol at Massey’s home the morning of the shooting. The third casing was picked up days later, when he learned three shots had been fired. But the pot sat untouched in the house for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “You knew an hour after the event occurred that the pot was basically employed as a weapon, but you didn’t collect it then,” Wykoff said. “You didn’t collect it during the second search when the third cartridge was collected. You collected it about two weeks later.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/russia-nuclear-drills-putin-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00-05:00","title":"Putin supervises readiness drills for Russian nuclear forces","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian President Vladimir Putin personally oversaw a comprehensive nuclear readiness drill involving all three branches of Russia’s nuclear triad — land (via a Yars missile from Plesetsk), sea (via a Sineva missile from a Bryansk submarine in the Barents Sea), and air (via Tu-95MS bombers launching cruise missiles).

getting paychecks this week \n       \n  By Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration’s move to issue paychecks this week to some but not all federal law enforcement employees during the government shutdown is sowing division in the ranks and does little to resolve the harm being done to ongoing investigations, current and former law enforcement officials tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under special accommodations from the Trump administration, agencies are providing paychecks on schedule to criminal investigative agents, including those who work for Justice Department agencies such as the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and at the US Secret Service, which is part of the Homeland Security department.\n \n\n   \n  But intelligence analysts and support staff at those agencies won’t be receiving their paychecks during the shutdown. The administration is limiting the paychecks to those categorized as 1811 employees, a reference to the code used for the White House’s budget office for criminal investigative agents.\n \n\n   \n  “You can imagine what that is doing to morale,” one current senior federal law enforcement official told CNN. “Our intelligence analysts are doing crucial work; without them cases don’t get made. So, to do this doesn’t send the right message.”\n \n\n   \n  Dan Brunner, a retired FBI agent who worked through a previous government shutdown says that paying only agents and not analysts and other staff will damage morale.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact is that analysts and professional staff all play a vital role in the entire FBI investigations. That’s why they have to continue working because they have an integral part. Every single person not just 1811s play a crucial role in the lifespan of an investigation,” Brunner said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House hasn’t said how they’re funding the paychecks for these criminal investigative agents.\n \n\n   \n  The impact is made worse because during the shutdown, investigators are limited in spending money on certain investigative activities.\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI can’t pay informants, they can’t do drug buys, they can’t travel. There’s no money. It’s not just the pay, it affects investigations. It stalls them,” Brunner said.\n \n\n   \n  At the FBI, employees were told last week that the bureau would pay agents for at least the next two paychecks, while other employees would not be paid during the shutdown. What’s more, agents will get not only their regular salaries but also the extra incentive pay that they receive on top of their salary for being available for unscheduled duty.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s really pissing people off,” one employee told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI Agents Association thanks President Donald Trump for ensuring special agents are paid, noting it “reflects the essential role FBI Agents play in protecting the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  The association added: “The FBI’s success, however, depends on more than its Agents. Analysts, professional staff, and other personnel — who continue to work without pay — play a vital role in confronting threats from terrorism and cyberattacks to violent crime and corruption.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN in a statement Wednesday that it is “actively pursuing options to pay all employees during the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n   “The FBI is made up of special agents, intelligence analysts, technical experts, and support personnel – all of whom are critical to our mission of defending the homeland and protecting the American people,” the statement said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/tesla-earnings","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00-22:30","title":"Tesla’s Best Quarter Isn’t Enough to Impress Investors: Profit Drop, Tax Credit Expiry, and Investor Skepticism","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tesla reported record car sales in Q3 2025, driven by a surge of buyers taking advantage of a federal tax credit that expired on October 1, 2025.

Because they know it won’t last \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:30 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  You’d think after a tumultuous year for Elon Musk’s car company, Wall Street would be cheering Tesla’s record quarterly sales. They’re not.\n \n\n   \n  That’s for two main reasons: First, Tesla’s profit fell from a year ago and missed analysts’ estimates.\n \n\n   \n  Second, Tesla’s sales were largely booming last quarter because customers scrambled to nab electric cars before a US tax credit expired.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of Tesla ( TSLA ) fell 2% in after-market trading following the report, but ahead of a call for investors scheduled for 5:30 pm ET.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla has a difficult road ahead, and investors know that. The ones still cheering and buying Tesla shares are those who aren’t focused on car sales. Instead, they believe in Musk’s promise of a future based on self-driving cars and robotics.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, neither Musk nor CFO Vaibhav Taneja spent significant time talking about car sales or profits during an hour-long call with investors and analysts on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Instead they spent most of the time talking about the promise of self-driving vehicles, robotaxis and humanoid robots, without much insight on when those thing will contribute to Tesla’s bottom line.\n \n\n   \n  Judging by after-market stock trading, investors were not impressed. Shares were down a bit less than 2% as the call got underway but fell steadily during the first half, hitting a low of down   about 5%. While shares climbed back, they were still down more than 3% when the hour concluded.\n \n\n   \n  As for the barely discussed financial results, the company earned adjusted income of $1.8 billion in the third quarter, down 29% from a year ago. That was a slightly bigger drop in earnings than analysts had forecast, and net income tumbled 37%.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the earnings miss, it was still the company’s best quarter so far this year.\n \n\n   \n  The drop in earnings came even after Tesla reported  record sales  of nearly 500,000 cars during the quarter, as Americans rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  But electric vehicle sales in the US are widely expected to plunge in the fourth quarter. That’s because people who would have normally bought EVs later in the year flocked to buy cars early to lock in the tax break. The loss of the tax credit is expected to hurt demand among American buyers going forward. Tesla gets nearly half of its revenue from US customers.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla is also facing increased competition for EV sales globally, particularly from Chinese automakers. Those automakers not only dominate their own domestic market, but are also moving into Europe. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs this year, despite the fact that it does not sell any cars in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla sales worldwide fell 13% during the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier both due to increased competition, as well as backlash to Musk’s political activity.\n \n\n   \n    Drop in key source of profits\n \n\n   \n  But the removal of the EV tax credit is only part of Tesla’s problem. The Trump administration also eliminated what has been a key profit driver throughout the company’s history – the  sale of regulatory credits .\n \n\n   \n  In years past, the federal government set emissions limits on the total greenhouse gases that came out of all the cars a company sold in a given year. If a car company sold too many gas-guzzling pickups, as opposed to economical hatchbacks or cars with no emissions at all, it would have to buy “credits” from companies like Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration’s massive tax and spending bill passed in July eliminated the federal penalties for violating emissions rules, and thus the need for automakers to buy regulatory credits.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the change in the law, the company still reported $417 million in regulatory credit sales in the third quarter. But that was $322 million less than a year ago, and the revenue loss caused a direct hit to the company’s bottom line. CFO Taneja did say the company entered into new regulatory credit contracts in the quarter, but did not give any details on those contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Regulatory credit sales have brought in $11.4 billion for Tesla since 2019. Sometimes they were   the only thing keeping the company profitable at all – including in the first three months of this year.\n \n\n   \n    Robots and robotaxis\n \n\n   \n  Tesla launched the company’s long-promised  robotaxi  offering with limited service in late June, with Musk promising much grander things to come.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Musk said he thinks the robotaxi service would be operating in eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. But that’s a long step back from the last earnings call in July ,  when he said the service would be available to half the US population by the year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  Musk said Tesla is still set to start production of the Cybercab, a vehicle for the robotaxi service that does not have a steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, by the second quarter next year. ﻿But the service now requires has a human safety driver sitting in the driver’s seat during each ride.\n \n\n   \n  “So so our goal is to be actually paranoid about deployment because obviously even one accident will be frontpage headline news worldwide,” he said. “So it’s better for us to take a cautious approach here. But we do expect to have no safety drivers in the car in Austin… within a few months.”\n \n\n   \n  It also said production lines for the first generation of its planned Optimus humanoid robots are being installed in anticipation of volume production. But it did not give details of when production might begin.\n \n\n   \n    Vote on Musk’s $1 trillion pay package\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s call was also Musk’s first time talking to investors since the company unveiled a new proposed pay package for the CEO, which could award him stock worth  $1 trillion . Shareholders are set to vote on that pay package at Tesla’s annual meeting next month. CFO Taneja took time at the end of the call to urge shareholders to support the pay package.\n \n\n   \n  Musk didn’t get into much detail about the compensation package, characterizing it as necessary for him to be able to keep control of the company.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” he said. “It’s just, you know, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?”\n \n\n   \n  “I just think that there needs to be enough voting control to give us strong influence,” he said near the end of the call, “but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-republicans-redistricting-battle-map-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"19:31:00-20:31","title":"North Carolina Legislature Gives Final Approval to New Congressional Map That Could Give GOP One More Seat in US House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Carolina’s legislature has approved a new congressional map that shifts 11 out of 14 House seats to Republicans, primarily by altering the district once held by Democratic Representative Don Davis.

legislature gives final approval to new congressional map that could give GOP one more seat in US House \n       \n  By Fredreka Schouten, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:31 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The North Carolina House on Wednesday gave final approval to a new congressional map aimed at helping Republicans eke out an additional GOP seat to help shore up the party’s majority in the US House after next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Bill 249 passed on a 66-48 vote. Members of the public were escorted out of the chamber after protests broke out shortly before the vote.\n \n\n   \n  State law does not give Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.\n \n\n   \n  Stein on Wednesday called the move a “disgraceful” abuse of power.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re afraid that they will lose in the midterms and afraid to say no to the president. So, they’ve turned their backs on you to silence your vote in the 2026 election. It’s outrageous,” Stein said in a video message posted after the vote. “When a candidate or a party loses an election, you’re supposed to work like hell to connect better with voters so that you can win the next time. You do not rig the rules of the game to guarantee your victory, the voters be damned.”\n \n\n   \n  The new map targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines are explicitly drawn to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina. Under the map used in last year’s elections, Republicans control 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  “While families in eastern North Carolina face real struggles and concerns, our state has prioritized passing a new congressional map that affects only our region, with the intention of predetermining the outcome of an election 377 days away,” said Davis in a statement released Wednesday evening. “It is not only one of the darkest moments in our state’s history, but the way it was done—offering limited public participation by those affected and ignoring the voices of those who did participate—is morally wrong on all fronts. Still, I remain committed to ensuring every voice in eastern North Carolina is heard, no matter how the lines are drawn.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now here we are in North Carolina, doing a fifth redistricting in five years. It’s not because of the census. It’s not because of a court order. It’s because of a command from a president. Unprecedented in U.S. history,” state Rep. Marcia Morey, a Democrat from Durham, noted, calling the process “map warfare.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans acknowledged the motivation behind the new map was helping President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Please support this legal proposal to help North Carolina help President Donald J. Trump make America great again,” said Rep. Jimmy Dixon from Warsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The final vote came just two days after Republican lawmakers, who control North Carolina’s legislature, formally opened debate on the map.\n \n\n   \n  The state joined  Texas  and  Missouri  in drawing new lines to benefit the GOP, bringing to seven the total number of new Republican-friendly districts created this year.\n \n\n   \n  The Tar Heel State was the latest state to begin work on a once-rare, mid-decade redistricting. The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip just a handful of seats to take control of the House after next year’s congressional elections.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican who helped oversee the map-drawing, described the high stakes in stark terms.\n \n\n   \n  “The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular: draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the congressional delegation,” he said. If Democrats take control of the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” Hise added.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans in North Carolina acted swiftly to accede to Trump’s wishes. State lawmakers held the first open meeting about the new map on Monday morning and approved it in the state Senate the following day – despite sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the public who showed up at the state Capitol in Raleigh to protest the move.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is a politically competitive state. And Democrats such as Stein and his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, have captured statewide offices in recent election cycles. But Republican leaders this week framed the lopsided congressional map as an outcome Trump deserved given his electoral success in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times,” the state Sen. Phil Berger, the top Republican in the Senate, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    State-by-state battle\n \n\n   \n  Legislators in deep-red Texas kicked off the political arms race this year with a  map that seeks to send five more Republicans  to Congress. Missouri Republicans also have drawn new lines aimed at adding  an additional GOP member  to the state’s congressional delegation. Both face court challenges, and activists in Missouri are seeking to overturn the map through a petition drive.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the biggest pushback from Democrats comes from  California, which launched a redistricting effort in response to Texas . A multimillion-dollar advertising and get-out-the vote campaign now is underway to persuade voters to temporarily override congressional maps drawn by an independent commission next month and create as many as five new US House seats for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have a clear advantage over Democrats in the number of states that could redraw maps. The GOP holds control of the governor’s office and both chambers of the legislature in 23 states, compared to Democrats’ 15.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in other Republican states also are contemplating new maps, including Kansas, where legislators have  approved  $460,000 to fund a special session that would target the lone Democrat representing the state in Washington, four-term Rep. Sharice Davids. Two-thirds of the state House and Senate must agree to call a special session.\n \n\n   \n  In Indiana, where Republicans hold a 7-2 edge in the US House, the White House has repeatedly urged the GOP lawmakers in the majority in the state legislature to target at least one of the Democratic-held seats. Vice President JD Vance has twice visited the state to lobby legislators.\n \n\n   \n  Two other Republican-controlled states, Ohio and Utah, also are in throes of redistricting battles that began before Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  In Utah, a judge found that an existing map hadn’t followed guidelines imposed by a citizen ballot measure. Earlier this month, the GOP-dominated legislature passed a new congressional map that could give Democrats a slim chance of breaking the GOP’s monopoly on the state’s congressional delegation.\n \n\n   \n  That map needs to go back before the judge for her approval, with a final decision expected in early November. At the same time, Republicans in the state have launched a signature-gathering petition in the hopes of blocking the new map.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, the redrawing of its congressional districts is an outgrowth of a state law that requires maps approved without bipartisan support be redrawn after four years. Crafting new maps will ultimately fall to the Republican-controlled General Assembly, likely next month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are vowing to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrat in the US House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is weighing an effort to counter Republicans in Ohio. If the map is passed along partisan lines, state law allows a voter referendum that could invalidate the map, and Jeffries is prepared to go all-in to support that effort — including raising money, according to a person familiar with his planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose internal deliberations.\n \n\n   \n  John Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Democrats will mount lawsuits, protests and citizen-led ballot initiatives to push back on the actions in GOP-dominated states.\n \n\n   \n  “Republicans are openly stating that they need to take away the voting power of the American people through gerrymandering in order to win the 2026 midterms,” Bisognano said in a statement. “That alone is a sign of incredible weakness. The fact that they are taking the gerrymandering crisis to even more states beyond Texas and Missouri underscores just how scared they are of the opposition they are facing from the American people – even in deep red states.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic fury in North Carolina\n \n\n   \n  Trump has praised the new lines, writing last week on Truth Social that it “would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ district representing a swath of eastern North Carolina is the only competitive US House seat remaining in North Carolina after previous rounds of redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump won the district last November even as Davis won a second term by less than two percentage points. The new map makes the district more favorable to Republicans by swapping out several counties with more conservative communities on the coast.\n \n\n   \n  Some North Carolina Republicans argued that actions in California – and other deep-blue states – required them to respond. “This is a political arms race that Republicans did not start,” Hise said, pointing for former President  Barack Obama ’s support of the California redistricting initiative.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic state lawmakers along with multiple members of the public who spoke during the elections committee meeting denounced the map as a brazen power grab.\n \n\n   \n  “California hasn’t redistricted a thing,” Mark Swallow of Democracy Out Loud, a liberal activist group, said during the public comment period in a Senate committee meeting. “What they’ve done is respond to Texas, which started this fiasco for our country, and put an initiative on the ballot to ask Californians if they should be redistricted.”\n \n\n   \n  “You should do the same,” he told legislators, “but I doubt that you will because you know that North Carolinians will never approve this scheme. So, you are liars and cheats. That’s what this boils down to. You’re liars and cheats.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic state Sen. Val Applewhite said Republican lawmakers were going along with Trump’s “coordinated national effort to reshape this country’s political map in his image to guarantee one thing: that Donald Trump and only Donald Trump remains in power.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/uva-trump-administration-settlement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:20:00Z","title":"Trump administration announces agreement with UVA","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has reached a landmark agreement with the University of Virginia (UVA), marking the first public university to settle federal civil rights investigations without paying a financial penalty or accepting external monitoring.

administration has reached  an agreement  with the University of Virginia, according to an announcement from the Department of Justice, marking the first public university to reach a deal with the White House after months of turmoil.\n \n\n   \n  The university has signed on to Justice Department guidelines on federal funding and discrimination and has agreed to “not engage in unlawful racial discrimination in its university programming, admissions, hiring, or other activities,” the Wednesday announcement said.\n \n\n   \n  Under the terms of the deal, UVA will not pay any financial settlement, unlike previous agreements reached with schools like  Columbia University  and  Brown University  to restore those schools’ federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  Nor will UVA have an outside monitor ensuring compliance – which was a key provision of Columbia’s agreement, and one that drew criticism about the federal government’s role on campus. Instead, the Justice Department said, “UVA will provide relevant information and data to the Department of Justice on a quarterly basis through 2028.”\n \n\n   \n  “The agreement does not require the University to make any monetary payments. Importantly, it preserves the academic freedom of our faculty, students, and staff. We will be treated no less favorably than any other university in terms of federal research grants and funding. The agreement does not involve external monitoring,” UVA interim President Paul Mahoney said in a letter to the school community Wednesday evening. “Instead, the University will update the Department of Justice quarterly on its efforts to ensure compliance with federal law.”\n \n\n   \n  In return, the Trump administration will pause ongoing investigations into the school, including its “admissions policies and other civil rights concerns,” the department said. Pending changes to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, the department “will close its investigations against UVA.”\n \n\n   \n  The agreement, which the New York Times first reported earlier Wednesday was close, marks the latest development in the Trump administration’s broader battle over campus oversight, federal funding and academic freedom.\n \n\n   \n  In June, the school’s president, James Ryan,  announced his resignation  amid pressure from the Department of Justice to dismantle the university’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Ryan’s resignation, the university’s board of visitors unanimously voted to scrap its Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Partnerships,  according  to Virginia GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office.\n \n\n   \n  But the university’s actions didn’t go far enough for the Justice Department and some conservative groups. Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, told CNN at the time that the university began “using a series of euphemisms to simply rebrand and repackage the exact same discriminatory programs that are illegal under federal law.”\n \n\n   \n  Dhillon praised Wednesday’s agreement as “notable” and said in a statement it would “protect students and faculty from unlawful discrimination, ensuring that equal opportunity and fairness are restored.”\n \n\n   \n  UVA is one of seven universities to reject what the Trump administration deemed a “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” that would unlock preferential access to federal funding. The offer, initially presented to nine schools earlier this month, included a series of demands, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with the Department of Justice’s announcement of an agreement with UVA.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/beef-argentina-republicans-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:35:00-04:00","title":"GOP Pushback Grows Over Trump’s Call to Buy Beef from Argentina","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has suggested a deal to purchase beef from Argentina to lower consumer prices, a proposal that has triggered widespread criticism from American farmers and Republican lawmakers.

I don’t see anything in this that puts America first,” Armstrong told CNN. “It’s hypocritical.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s stories from farmers like Armstrong that have come into Rep. Erin Houchin’s office.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve heard concerns from constituents,” Houchin, a Republican, said in a statement to CNN. “For now, this remains only a suggestion from President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  And it has Republicans on Capitol Hill frantically raising alarm bells with the White House and even the president directly. The potential for such a move is testing the support of one of Trump’s most loyal group of supporters as his policies could risk their livelihoods. The unfolding episode also marks a rare moment on Capitol Hill where many Republicans are publicly breaking with the president and demanding he reverse course.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a topic that has dominated the conversation with Trump — from Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, who told CNN he has spoken “extensively” to the president on the issu, on down to freshmen like Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana. And the issue was raised by GOP senators in a private meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday.   \n \n\n   \n  “What we’re hearing from Montana ranchers and American ranchers and farmers generally is, ‘Give us a chance to do this with American products, with American producers first, before we turn to foreign markets’,” Sheehy told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A handful of House Republicans led by GOP Rep. Julie Fedorchak of North Dakota also sent a letter directly to Trump asking for more details and clarity.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson shared that House Republicans raised concerns about the Argentina beef proposal on their private call Tuesday and said GOP Rep. Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, who represents a lot of cattle ranchers, has been connected with administration officials and the office of the United States trade representative.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re having those thoughtful discussions,” Johnson said at a press conference Wednesday. “The White House doesn’t want any unintended consequences. What they’re trying to do is improve the lives of everyday Americans, make our economy work again, and make sure that we are treated fairly by trading partners around the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The concerns from prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill come after Trump recently suggested he’s considering a deal to purchase beef from the economically struggling Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  “We would buy some beef from Argentina. If we do that, that will bring our beef prices down,” Trump said. “The one thing that’s kept up is beef. And if we buy some beef, I’m not talking about that much from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country.”\n \n\n   \n  The president of the US Cattlemen’s Association, Justin Tupper, told CNN his phone has been ringing off the hook from cattle ranchers across the country since Trump floated the idea on Sunday. He’s spoken with Thune’s staff and has sent a letter to the president requesting a meeting to urge him not to buy more beef from Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  American farmers have been having a tough year in no small part because of Trump’s trade war. Farmers across the country have been  issuing increasingly urgent warnings  that they’ll face grim consequences if they don’t get help selling this year’s bumper crop that many have begun harvesting. The White House is  gearing up  to extend farmers a multi-billion-dollar bailout, but that has yet to materialize. And farmers are warning that Trump’s idea of buying Argentinian beef to try and lower consumer prices could make matters worse.\n \n\n   \n  “Beef cattle were the only thing that’s keeping us afloat. If the prices drop, it’s going to affect us right now. It’s going to affect generations to come,” Randy Roberts, a beef and crop producer in Indiana, told CNN. “It will be hard for younger generations to get into the cattle business.”\n \n\n   \n  Even as criticisms from Republicans to the idea of the US buying Argentinian beef are pouring in, some are hopeful that the idea ultimately does not come to fruition.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska, who represents a significant number of cattle feeding operations in his district, said he has been told by Trump administration officials that the president is being briefed on the issue and taking it seriously.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hesitant to suggest this is anything but a blip on the radar because there’s no real identified plan,” Flood told CNN. “That said it is something we are paying very close attention to, and I am going to work every day on behalf of Nebraska farmers and ranchers. I prioritize Nebraska farmers and ranchers. I will stand up for farmers and ranchers. Right now, I’m expressing concern about anything that’s disrupting our beef market in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Already, the pushback to the administration’s proposal online has been fierce.\n \n\n   \n  Meriwether Farms, a Wyoming based beef company, called Trump out directly in a  social media post .\n \n\n   \n  “Dear @POTUS Trump, we love you and support you— but your suggestion to buy beef from Argentina to stabilize beef prices would be an absolute betrayal to the American cattle rancher,” the post reads.\n \n\n   \n  The blowback mounted quickly after Trump floated the idea for a deal to purchase beef from Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Even amid growing opposition, the president appeared to double down on his position Wednesday, posting on Truth Social that cattle ranchers don’t understand why they are “doing so well,” citing his tariff policy.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” Trump posted.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the day, the president argued again that his administration’s tariff policies have greatly benefited US cattle ranchers.\n \n\n   \n  “I helped them a lot,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “I put tariffs on things coming in to the country, including beef, and that gave them a chance to finally have a decent industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The president added that he’s now trying to balance aiding the industry with bringing down consumer beef prices.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been able to have an industry, but I also want to keep the beef prices low,” Trump said. “We’re going to do something very quickly and easily on beef to get it down.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump is planning to speak with ranchers about the initiative, he said, though he didn’t specify which groups within the beef industry he planned to hear from.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/white-house-east-wing-demolition-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:24:00-20:00","title":"Why Trump’s sudden East Wing demolition is extraordinary — and dicey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has ordered the demolition of the East Wing of the White House, which was initially promised not to interfere with the existing structure.

He noted his New York projects often took years to break ground.\n \n\n   \n  “They said, ‘Sir, you can start tonight,’” Trump said. “I said, what are you talking about? ‘You have zero zoning conditions. You’re the president of’ – I said, you got to be kidding.”\n \n\n   \n  The president continued to marvel: “He said, ‘Sir, this is the White House. You’re the president of the United States. You can do anything you want.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has now done what he wants — in ways that are causing plenty of consternation.\n \n\n   \n  Images of the  demolition of the existing East Wing , where the new ballroom will be located, have  spurred apoplexy  among Trump’s detractors and growing criticism from architectural and preservation groups.\n \n\n   \n  The optics have also, perhaps tellingly, set off some metaphorical damage control at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The Treasury Department, which sits next to the East Wing, has instructed employees not to share photos of the demolition. (The department claimed in a statement to CNN this was to protect sensitive information.) The administration has railed against the “manufactured outrage” about the demolition in a series of social media posts and TV interviews. And the White House on Tuesday published  an extensive blog post  recapping previous renovations to the grounds.\n \n\n   \n  But there are a number of reasons why this situation is remarkable — and different from your usual presidential renovation.\n \n\n   \n  A big one is that the scenes this week fly in the face of how this was billed.\n \n\n   \n  When the project was announced in late July, Trump assured it “won’t interfere with the current building.”\n \n\n   \n  “It won’t be — it’ll be near it but not touching it,” he said at the time\n \n\n   \n  Much of the East Wing has now been torn down. While many Trump defenders wagered early this week photos made the demolition look more extensive than it actually was, the Washington Post reported late Tuesday that “ it appeared that what remained was also headed for demolition , with no evidence that the structure was being protected and only jagged damage visible in the exposed building.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked to account for Trump’s past comments, White House aide Will Scharf effectively acknowledged that plans had changed.\n \n\n   \n  “The scope and size was always subject to vary as the project developed,” Scharf, who also oversees federal construction as head of the National Capital Planning Commission,  told Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  The White House also assured that the construction planning would go through a robust process.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement when the project was announced, chief of staff Susie Wiles said Trump and the White House were “fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserve the special history of the White House.”\n \n\n   \n  There is very little evidence that’s actually happened.\n \n\n   \n  A number of groups that you might expect to be involved in such a process have criticized the lack of consultation or pushed for more.\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, on Tuesday  requested a pause in the demolition . It urged the White House to “go through the legally required public review processes … and to invite comment from the public.”\n \n\n   \n  The Society of Architectural Historians last week expressed “ great concern ” about the ballroom project. The group said it generally limited “its advocacy to matters of national and international import,” while urging a more “rigorous and deliberate design and review process.”\n \n\n   \n  And the American Institute of Architects back in August urged a number of steps that don’t appear to have been followed, including a rigorous search for the best architect and transparency about the process and its funding.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has said the $200 million project, which he said last week has been fully funded, is being paid for by private donations. Some donors have been named. But the White House has  not yet released a comprehensive list  or a breakdown of the donations.\n \n\n   \n  “This is more than an addition to a building,” the American Institute of Architects   wrote in August , arguing that it should be “ guided by a process that is preservation-first, performance-driven, and accountable to the public.”\n \n\n   \n  As recently as last month, Scharf suggested that even the National Capital Planning Commission he leads hadn’t been involved up to that point. He noted that it had no specific role in the demolition aspect.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” Scharf said.\n \n\n   \n  And the last point is that, yes, other presidents have overseen renovations. But the scale of this is on another level.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the  projects listed by the White House  Tuesday were much smaller and included no structural changes — like building swimming pools, internal refurbishments and restorations, landscaping and hardscaping.\n \n\n   \n  The list even included President Barack Obama installing a garden for the White House kitchen and converting a tennis court so that it could be used for basketball.\n \n\n   \n  The Society of Architectural Historians said the new White House ballroom will be the first “major change to its exterior appearance” since 1942. And even then, that project was merely adding to the existing East Wing, with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt adding a second story featuring additional office space and an emergency bunker.\n \n\n   \n  Even that relatively minor change led to criticisms from Republicans, who called the project wasteful and accused Roosevelt of doing it for political purposes, according to  the White House Historical Association .\n \n\n   \n  The ballroom will also be massive. It was initially described as accommodating 650 guests, but Trump told NBC News last month that it would wind up  being “a little bigger” than initially billed . He has more recently said that number could stretch to nearly 1,000.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often exaggerates the size of properties, so it’s not clear whether the ballroom will now actually be bigger than the initially planned 90,000-square-foot facility. But the National Trust for Historic Preservation cautioned Tuesday that even the initially planned size would “overwhelm the White House itself,” given the main White House building is 55,000 square feet.\n \n\n   \n  And again, that calls into question how this project was billed.\n \n\n   \n  In between his boasts about his power to make this happen quickly last week, Trump expressed that he “didn’t want to dwarf anything.”\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION:  This story has been updated to remove a quote that the  Associated Press  inaccurately attributed to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/trump-doj-request-230-mil-explained","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:07:00Z","title":"What we know about Trump’s bid to claim $230 million from his own Justice Department","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has filed two administrative claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, seeking $230 million in compensation from his own Justice Department.

$230 million from his own Justice Department \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn  Polantz, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:07 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s demand that his own  Justice Department hand over $230 million  as compensation for federal investigations into his behavior is an unprecedented example of how his past indictment lingers over the presidency.\n \n\n   \n  His ask, made through administrative claims filed in 2023 and 2024 — and reported as of Wednesday to be still on the table by the  New York Times  —   also shines a light on the possible ethics conflicts that arise from his decision to install his former defense lawyers to run the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Trump now has the ability to sue the federal government and leave the courts to decide whether he was harmed and deserved compensation. But, the saga could also end with his own Justice Department negotiating with him, and choosing to cut a deal that would likely require approval from one of his former attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear why these claims have resurfaced now.\n \n\n   \n  One person who had worked with Trump in the past simply said Trump doesn’t forget.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s going down the list and checking it twice. And he doesn’t really need to decide to be naughty or nice,” said the person, who was familiar with Trump’s decision making when the most recent claim, related to the  search of his Mar-a-Lago home , was filed.\n \n\n   \n  There is no final word on whether Trump will receive that payment, and the DOJ is not required to publicly announce settlements it reaches over administrative claims.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s $230 million demand, though, far dwarfs past DOJ payouts to the victims of sex abuse and mass shootings whose murder or exploitation were attributable to mistakes by the government.\n \n\n   \n     The claims \n \n\n   \n  Trump filed his two complaints to the Justice Department in the form of an administrative claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act — a first step to see whether a settlement can be reached before suing the government for damages.\n \n\n   \n  Claims are filed on something called a Standard Form 95, in which a person outlines how they were injured by the federal government and what financial compensation they are seeking. Should DOJ officials reject the claim, the person could then file a lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s case, his attorneys filed two separate administrative claims over allegations that he was damaged by the several federal investigations and prosecutions he faced both during his first term as president and while he was out of office, according to the New York Times and the forms they have published.\n \n\n   \n  The first claim, filed in 2023, seeks damages over the investigations into whether his 2016 presidential campaign had worked with Russia to help him win the election. The second, filed in 2024, accuses the FBI and DOJ of violating Trumps privacy during a search of his  Mar-a-Lago  estate and of malicious prosecution for the subsequent charges he faced over mishandling classified documents.\n \n\n   \n  While neither investigation resulted in Trump’s conviction (he was never charged in the Russia investigation and a federal judge tossed the classified documents case), the president has pointed to both as evidence that democratic officials weaponized the justice system against him.\n \n\n   \n  In the Mar-a-Lago claim, Trump says he was wronged especially in the decision by the FBI and Justice Department to search his house without his cooperation.\n \n\n   \n  “[Then-Attorney General Merrick] Garland and [then-FBI Director Christopher] Wray should have never approved a raid and subsequent indictment of President Trump because the well-established protocol with former U.S. presidents is to use non-enforcement means to obtain records of the United States,” his claim letter said.\n \n\n   \n  In that claim, Trump requests compensation for his legal costs, which he says were about $15 million related to being a criminal defendant charged in court. Trump also says in his claim he deserves a $100 million compensation for punitive damages.\n \n\n   \n  The lawyer who filed the Mar-a-Lago complaint on Trump’s behalf, Daniel Epstein, hasn’t responded to multiple inquiries from CNN.\n \n\n   \n     Settlement negotiations \n \n\n   \n  Though Trump filed the claims while out of office, the Justice Department did not act on it under the previous administration because of its practice to pause any civil litigation, including administrative claims, while there is a criminal investigation pending, a person familiar with the process told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s settlement requests reportedly amount to $230 million — a number that far surpasses the  $138.7 million settlement  made to the victims of convicted sex abuser Larry Nassar, the $144.4 million settlement made with the families of victims in the Sutherland Springs mass shooting in Texas, and the  $88 million settlement  made to the families of victims in the Mother Emanuel church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  So far in 2025, the federal judgment has paid out only $207 million for settlements in claims made against the Justice Department, according to federal data from the Treasury Department.\n \n\n   \n  That total number represents more than 250 total claims, many of which received payments of less than $2 million each, and are linked to issues of employment discrimination, incidents with the Bureau of Prisons system and environmental hazardous waste cleanup.\n \n\n   \n  If the DOJ agrees to Trump’s staggering request,  taxpayers  would likely foot the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Trump acknowledged reports of settlement negotiations Tuesday,  saying  in the Oval Office that he “could be” seeking $230 million from his own Justice Department as compensation for past investigations into him. He professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it,” Trump said. “All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of negotiations between Trump’s attorneys and the Justice Department are not clear. Trump acknowledged Tuesday the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump does not have the authority to personally approve the settlement, however. Such a decision would need to be made by Todd Blanche, his former attorney and current Deputy attorney general, or Stanley Woodward, the associate attorney general who previously worked as counsel to one of Trump’s senior aides charged in the classified documents case.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin told CNN that “all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials” should top officials be conflicted in the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi fired her top ethics advisor in July, CNN  previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  “He has vacated almost all the internal oversight offices, not only within the Department of Justice, but across the government,” John Dean, President Richard Nixon’s White House Counsel, said in an interview with CNN. Dean said the move was “clearly intentional” and means that “there’s no check here.”\n \n\n   \n  “That doesn’t mean that everybody isn’t watching,” Dean said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/barack-obama-california-redistricting","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:29:00Z","title":"Barack Obama joins Gavin Newsom to promote California Democrats’ effort to redraw US House maps","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former President Barack Obama joined California Governor Gavin Newsom in a virtual event to promote Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment that would empower Democrats to redraw U.S. House maps in response to Republican-led gerrymandering.

one of the most iconic battlefields in American history suffered recent damage, prompting a law enforcement investigation.\n \n\n   \n  A National Park Service ranger, who asked not to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN there is extensive damage to a stone wall by a parking lot in the Devil’s Den area of  Gettysburg National Military Park  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  The ranger says the damage was reported to the National Park Service on the morning of October 14, and the park service’s law enforcement arm is investigating.\n \n\n   \n  On its Facebook page, the  Gettysburg Foundation , a non-profit partner of the park,  posted  pictures of the wall with a section collapsed, and parts of stone strewn on the ground. The post implores the public to help protect the park. “Remember that we are all stewards of National Park Service sites! Our priority is the safety of our visitors, as well as the protection of our National Parks. Think like the cavalry and be the eyes and ears for the National Park Service during the government shutdown. If you see something, say something,” the post says.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Gettysburg Foundation told CNN there is no video of the incident and there were no eyewitnesses, so they are not sure if it was vandalism or an accident.\n \n\n   \n  The park ranger noted “this isn’t just a little bump or dent” caused by a vehicle over-shooting its parking space. “This is significantly more than that.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if the wall could be repaired, the ranger said, “It can be repaired to its original state, but it’s going to take time and money, neither of which we have right now.”\n \n\n   \n  While the Gettysburg Foundation spokesperson says that the stone wall itself has no historical significance, Devil’s Den was the scene of intense fighting between Union and Confederate forces on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, with both sides suffering heavy casualties at the location.\n \n\n   \n  A  National Park Service  spokesperson told CNN in a statement, “preliminary indications suggest the wall was struck by a vehicle. The wall serves as a parking barrier and has been damaged before by vehicles attempting to turn or park in the small lot… The surrounding landscape and boulder formations remain intact and protected.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident has raised anxieties for the  National Parks Conservation Association .\n \n\n   \n  “These Civil War battlefields are open-air museums”, said Ed Stierli, Mid-Atlantic Senior Regional Director of the NPCA.  “We’re really concerned.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Park Service contends the parks are protected. “Our law enforcement rangers are at 100% capacity as we continue to prioritize critical functions that protect life, property, and public health, including law enforcement, emergency response, and visitor access. During this time, all of our law enforcement rangers are on duty and conducting regular patrols,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation comes as park advocates and local business proprietors have said there are increased reports of trash buildup and other problems at national parks during the government shutdown. CNN has received accounts of park-goers flying drones and base-jumping at locations like Yosemite National Park in California. These actions are generally illegal inside national parks.\n \n\n   \n  The National Park Service spokesperson said that at Gettysburg, “There has been no increase in vandalism, trash buildup or visitor misconduct unique to the shutdown period.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/weather/tropical-storm-melissa-caribbean-track","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:03:00Z","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Forecasts to Become Major Hurricane, Threatens Caribbean","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, currently 300 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, is moving slowly at 2 mph and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane by Saturday, possibly reaching Category 4 by Monday.

concerning track \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Mary Gilbert, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:03 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa is crawling through the Caribbean Sea, threatening to unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides across parts of the region later this week. It’s proof this year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  is not over yet, and Melissa has plenty of time and fuel ahead.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was about 300 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was churning forward at an agonizingly slow 2 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rain is already spreading north Wednesday as Melissa moves at a snail’s pace toward Jamaica and Haiti. A foot or more of rain is possible in southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through this weekend. That much rain over mountainous terrain in the area could trigger catastrophic flash flooding and landslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is moving over water that’s so warm it’s essentially rocket fuel for storms this late in the season, and is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday morning.\n \n\n   \n  When that happens, it will be the 2025 Atlantic season’s fifth hurricane and the first to spin up inside the Caribbean. It’s also now forecast to become the season’s fourth major hurricane — Category 3 or greater.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica. There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Two possible outcomes, neither good\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios. The possibilities have changed slightly from initial forecasts, but both place Hispaniola and Jamaica in harm’s way.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring close to a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, which is the island that houses the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as it drifts closer to the island through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still unclear exactly what parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. Jamaica could also receive torrential, flooding rainfall beginning later this week.\n \n\n   \n  The islands will also face strong, potentially damaging winds from Melissa, especially after it reaches hurricane strength Saturday, according to the hurricane center’s forecast.\n \n\n   \n  Slow-moving storms like Melissa hit the same areas with torrential rain and strong winds for days, significantly increasing rainfall totals and   the likelihood of   power outages. Melissa will start moving quicker at some point, and exactly when and where that happens is extremely important to determine its impacts. It’s also still quite unclear.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa’s current forecast track holds and the storm moves slowly west toward an area south of Jamaica into early next week, it could end up where the atmosphere and extremely warm water align to boost the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is now expected to become at least a Category 4 major hurricane by Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Its anticipated explosion in strength from tapping into that energy is something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  A stronger Melissa would eventually turn northeast next week and threaten other portions of the Caribbean, like Cuba.   That scenario would increase the intensity of all of Melissa’s impacts from rain to wind and dangerous seas.\n \n\n   \n  Alternatively, there’s still a chance that another weather pattern could pull Melissa north toward Jamaica or Haiti early next week. This path would likely prevent Melissa from reaching the strength it might in the first scenario, but could also mean a direct landfall and more concentrated impacts in either location.\n \n\n   \n    Is this a threat to the US?\n \n\n   \n  A direct hit on the mainland US is unlikely, but not impossible. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  Florida could be in play if Melissa takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.\n \n\n   \n  The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently,  Hurricane Nicole  slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and  Hurricane Zeta  smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.\n \n\n   \n  As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.\n \n\n   \n  Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/middleeast/icj-israel-humanitarian-aid-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00Z","title":"UN’s top court rebukes Israel over Gaza aid restrictions during war","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations’ top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), issued an advisory opinion stating that Israel, as an occupying power, is legally obligated to permit and facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza, rejecting claims that the blockade is justified by security concerns.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United Nations’ top court issued a legal opinion Wednesday stating that Israel, as an occupying power, is obligated to work with UN agencies   to facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza, a rebuke of the  blockade  it imposed on the Palestinian enclave earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The International Court of Justice also said in its advisory opinion that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the main UN body serving Palestinian refugees, has not violated impartiality rules and that Israel must support the agency’s relief work.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion was requested by the UN General Assembly in December after  Israel passed laws banning UNRWA,  from operating in the country, significantly curtailing its ability to deliver aid to Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The occupying power may never invoke reasons of security to justify the general suspension of all humanitarian activities in occupied territory,” Judge Iwasawa Yuji said while delivering the opinion, which also said Israel is obliged to ensure the basic needs of civilians in Gaza are met. “After examining the evidence, the court finds that the local population in Gaza Strip has been inadequately supplied.”\n \n\n   \n  The advisory opinion – aimed at addressing Israel’s obligations to the UN, aid organizations and third-party states in the occupied West Bank and Gaza – is non-binding, but it does carry political weight and is expected to increase pressure on Israel to cooperate with the UN and other aid agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s ambassador to the UN criticized the court’s opinion as “shameful.”\n \n\n   \n  The US State Department called the opinion “corrupt” and claimed that it “unfairly bashes Israel and gives UNRWA a free pass for its deep entanglement with and material support for Hamas terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel has accused UNRWA of having more than a thousand employees affiliated with Hamas, and of teaching hate against Israel in its schools. UNRWA has repeatedly denied the accusations, saying there are no grounds for “a blanket description” of the whole institution as being infiltrated by Hamas. A  UN investigation found  that nine employees from UNWRA’s 13,000 staff in Gaza “may have” been involved in the Hamas-led October 7 attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But the court said Wednesday that Israel has not substantiated allegations ﻿“that a significant part of UNRWA employees are members of Hamas or other terrorist factions.”\n \n\n   \n  “The court concludes that in the present circumstances, the United Nations, acting through UNRWA, has been an indispensable provider of humanitarian relief in the Gaza Strip,” the judge said, also criticizing the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which Israel has claimed was a replacement for some of UNRWA’s work.\n \n\n   \n  “The court recalls Israel’s obligation not to use starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare as an occupying power,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli officials have accused the UN court of being politicized and weaponized against Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “They are blaming Israel for not cooperating with UN organs … They should be blaming themselves. Those organs became breeding grounds for terrorists,” Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the UN, claimed Wednesday in response to the opinion, which he described as a “political document.”\n \n\n   \n  A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been in place for more than a week, and Israel is allowing increased aid into Gaza in line with the truce agreement’s goal of 600 trucks per day, according to US and Israeli officials.\n \n\n   \n  Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General, welcomed the “unambiguous” legal opinion in a post on X and stated that the UN has the resources to “immediately scale up” the humanitarian response in the territory.\n \n\n   \n    More international court cases pending\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s opinion is one of several cases related to Israel that the UN court has weighed in on since the war began in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024, the ICJ said that Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an  unprecedented move  that called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories that Palestinians want for a future state.\n \n\n   \n  The sweeping opinion ran through a list of Israeli practices that the ICJ said violated international law, including confiscating land, building Israeli settlements in the territories, and depriving Palestinians of natural resources and the right to self-determination. In a case that predated the Israel-Hamas war, the court said Israel abused its position as an occupying power and called on it to cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians firmly rejected that ICJ opinion at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The ICJ also issued a series of emergency measures related to Gaza in 2024, including ordering Israel to  immediately halt  its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, classifying the humanitarian situation there as “disastrous.”\n \n\n   \n  Those measures are part of a broader case brought by South Africa against Israel, which accuses Israel of breaching its obligations under the genocide convention – a claim Israel has vehemently and repeatedly denied.\n \n\n   \n  The ICJ case on genocide is ongoing and expected to last several years. It comes against a backdrop of an  independent UN inquiry ’s conclusion in September that found Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which echoed the findings of other  genocide experts  and  human rights groups , and which Israel rejected.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli government has maintained that it conducted the war in Gaza in compliance with international law. The government has also repeatedly accused the UN of anti-Israel bias.\n \n\n   \n  The UN court’s proceedings are separate from the investigation into alleged war crimes in Gaza being carried out by  the International Criminal Court  – another international legal body based in The Hague, Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  Late last year, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and a now-deceased senior Hamas official, Mohammed Deif, who Israel has said was one of the masterminds of the October 7 attacks, and others.\n \n\n   \n  Israel doesn’t recognize the ICC, but it is bound by the statute of the ICJ as a UN member state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-curtis-sliwa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-04:00","title":"Curtis Sliwa uses a 'Braveheart' reference to explain why he won’t drop out of the NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for mayor of New York City, is refusing to drop out of the mayoral race despite mounting pressure from business allies and political figures, including WABC owner John Catsimatidis and investor Bill Ackman, who want to create a direct matchup between Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo.

‘Braveheart’ reference to explain why he won’t drop out of the NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:29 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for mayor of New York, can hardly believe the position he finds himself in.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past few weeks, I feel like I’m watching an Eddie Murphy movie, ‘Trading Places,’” he said during a fiery appearance Wednesday morning on the New York radio station where he hosted a show before taking leave to run for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  “Cuomo is on WABC all the time now,” he said, “while I’m out on the campaign trail, pinching babies, shaking hands. He’s become the radio guy; now I’m the politician.”\n \n\n   \n  A longtime fixture in New York City politics, Sliwa now has a key role in one of the most consequential mayoral races in decades. Heading into the second general election debate Wednesday at 7 p.m., Sliwa is likely to be at the center of the discussion, even as he runs third in the polls.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa is the target of a frantic pressure campaign to drop out of the mayoral race from opponents of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani who want to create a one-on-one matchup between Mamdani and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. Among the people pressuring Sliwa is WABC owner John Catsimatidis, a top New York Republican and ally of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a Queens native himself, has all but written Sliwa off. Several of Sliwa’s former colleagues at WABC have urged him to drop out. And Cuomo on Monday predicted his “collapse.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, however, insists he will not exit. He colorfully maintained his defiance Wednesday, accusing former WABC colleagues of “stabbing” him in the back and vowing that he would never come back to the station.\n \n\n   \n  Using another cinematic metaphor, Sliwa rejected any potential partnerships with Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  “Remember that scene in ‘Braveheart?’” Sliwa asked. “Mel Gibson at the end, when the executioner was impaling him?  If all of a sudden, the executioner would’ve stopped, and I was on that gurney, and said, ‘Hey, you can work for Mayor Andrew Cuomo,’ I would say, ‘Finish the job. Impale me.’”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, has alarmed some moderate Democrats with his  progressive ideas ,  past criticisms of police  and relative lack of experience. Some Jewish voters are concerned about his  criticisms of Israel  and question his commitment to fighting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  But the upstart progressive has been consolidating his support since the primary, opening a double-digit lead over Cuomo and Mamdani in public polling. He’s won the endorsements of several key Democrats, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and  met with Jewish groups  and  police officers  as he tries to shore up perceived weaknesses.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s backers have watched with frustration and blame Sliwa for splintering the anti-Mamdani vote. The investor Bill Ackman, among the most vocal Cuomo proponents on social media,  claimed  that Mamdani “is actively working” to keep Sliwa in the race. Mamdani has mocked Ackman and dismissed that claim.\n \n\n   \n  In tearing into Cuomo and the business interests backing him, Sliwa at times seems to echo Mamdani, the democratic socialist, with his sharp criticism of billionaires and elites. In an interview with the journalist Nate Friedman released over the weekend, the GOP nominee told Ackman to “stay in your lane.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa’s Republican supporters in the city have signaled their intention to stand by the party’s nominee. On Tuesday ahead of the final debate, a collection of county Republican Party chairs – including Catsimatidis’ daughter Andrea, the Manhattan GOP chair – issued a joint statement affirming that “our party is united behind Curtis Sliwa.”\n \n\n   \n  Previous Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani has also maintained his support for Sliwa and hosted the candidate on his own show. “Curtis Sliwa has my complete and total endorsement,” he  said .\n \n\n   \n  “The undecided ones, if this is like any other political situation, are going to break the same way, or they’re not going to vote,” Giuliani said Monday. “Remember, it’s a poll. And it’s not just they’re unfair to Trump, they are, that’s given. They’re also very often completely useless.”\n \n\n   \n  And on WABC Wednesday, Sliwa dismissed hypothetical outcomes if he continued his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “To me they’re the same,” Sliwa said, when asked if he’d prefer Cuomo or Mamdani to become the next mayor. “First day of voting is on Saturday. I’m going to be there, before the polls open up, to cast my vote for Curtis Sliwa and every Republican downballot.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/entertainment/bon-jovi-tour","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00Z","title":"Jon Bon Jovi Returns to Tour After Vocal Surgery","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jon Bon Jovi, lead singer of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame-inducted band Bon Jovi, is returning to live performances for the first time since undergoing vocal surgery in 2022.

underwent vocal surgery, the beloved band that was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2018 has announced they’re heading back out on the road.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s tour will kick off in July 2026 at Madison Square Garden in New York City and include stops in London, Dublin and Edinburgh.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a lot of joy in this announcement – joy that we can share these nights together with our amazing fans and joy that the band can be together,” Jon Bon Jovi said in a statement. “And I’ve spoken extensively on my gratitude, but I will say it again, I’m deeply grateful that the fans and the brotherhood of this band have been patient and allowed me the time needed to get healthy and prepare for touring. I’m ready and excited!”\n \n\n   \n  The lead singer’s recuperation from 2022 vocal surgery was the focal point of the Hulu docuseries titled “Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story.”\n \n\n   \n  The band will release “Forever (Legendary Edition)” on Friday.

I was singing well enough in the studio for the recording, but the vocal demands and rigors of touring were still out of reach for me,” he said. “Without the ability to tour or promote an album we were all very proud of, I decided to call on some friends to help me in my time of need. All are great singers, artists, and also just great people.”\n \n\n   \n  The tour dates are as follows:\n \n\n   \n  Concert goers can sign up at  bonjovi.com  to access the artist presale, which begins at 10 a.m. ET on October 27.

Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:14 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Federal Reserve was already facing one of its most difficult battles, steering a shifting economy through a weakening labor market and stubborn inflation. The government shutdown just made that fight even harder.\n \n\n   \n  To make determinations about its rate policy and other decisions to help the economy, the Fed relies heavily on official economic statistics that are collected and disseminated by the government. The shutdown has effectively  cut off access to that data  — from the unemployment rate to retail sales — since the beginning of October.\n \n\n   \n  With just one week to go before the Fed’s next decision on interest rates, officials are flying partially blind as they assess whether the labor market requires additional support, after data through August showed  the weakest pace of hiring since 2010  and rising unemployment among young Americans and minorities.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest wrinkle for policymakers as they tackle a continued attack from the Trump administration on their independence, an ongoing housing affordability crisis that the Fed doesn’t have all the tools to fix, the potential effects of AI, persistent inflation, uncertainty around tariffs and a slowdown in the job market.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed and the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of government data, Fed officials have turned to other sources to gauge the labor market and consumer spending — two important drivers of the US economy and the focus of the Fed’s so-called dual mandate to balance economic growth with keeping prices in check.\n \n\n   \n  The problem is that government data is undisputedly the “gold standard” of how the world’s largest economy is measured. Without it, the Fed’s decision making is not fully informed. And the Fed might have even less access to private employment data this time around, after payroll software provider ADP ended its data-sharing agreement with the Fed in August, according to  The American Prospect .\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that the Fed misjudges where the state of its dual mandate sits, whether inflation or the labor market is the bigger concern,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at asset manager Glenmede, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Fed officials set monetary policy without key economic data was during the 2018-2019 shutdown. Minutes from the Fed’s  January 2019 meeting  showed how officials turned to figures on card transactions and vehicles sales in the absence of the Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t call it a data drought,” New York Fed President John Williams told the New York Times in an interview published on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still getting a significant amount of data,” he added, pointing to surveys from the Conference Board, the New York Fed and the Institute for Supply Management. Those surveys measure trends in prices, demand, production and overall economic activity.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release the Consumer Price Index for September, having recalled staff to ensure the report can be used as a basis for  Social Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustments. \n \n\n   \n  Still, that leaves the Fed in the dark on the labor market’s true health and trajectory. Economists widely agree that private-sector figures cannot fully replace government data, especially considering that the government’s numbers serve as the benchmark for much of the private data.\n \n\n   \n    A housing affordability crisis the Fed can’t fix\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s main tool — its key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs more broadly — is particularly effective at making borrowing cheaper or more costly, depending on whether the Fed is trying to tamp down inflation or boost employment. So, it’s pretty good at changing how much consumers demand goods and services.\n \n\n   \n  But it does nothing to balance the “supply” side of the supply and demand equation, which is precisely what continues to drive up prices in some parts of the country, such as the Northeast.\n \n\n   \n  Sales of previously owned homes have been sluggish for the third-straight year, and persistently elevated mortgage rates have certainly played a role in keeping buyers on the sidelines. But so has the housing shortage.\n \n\n   \n  “Sales of affordable homes are constrained by the lack of inventory,” National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement last month.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed has already acknowledged that there’s only so much it can do to alleviate America’s housing woes.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a long-term housing shortage,” Powell said in a news conference after the Fed’s July meeting. “This is not something the Fed can help with.”\n \n\n   \n    The impacts of AI and economic uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s aggressive bid to reshape global trade has forced many businesses to put hiring plans on ice as they wait to see how everything plays out. And at the same time, many companies are actively trying to figure out how to implement AI into their operations.\n \n\n   \n  The result: unusually weak hiring, largely driven by businesses feeling paralyzed. But for some workers, it’s also because of AI.\n \n\n   \n  “The labor market has been frozen up because people are just having a hard time making decisions,” Laura Ullrich, an economist at Indeed, told CNN. “And AI is certainly having some impact on entry-level tech jobs.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate cuts should function like a tide that lifts all boats by making borrowing cheaper, allowing companies to expand head count. But that might not be enough to shore up demand for workers in roles that are increasingly being automated by AI.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, while the Fed is poised to lower rates further, “so long as economic uncertainty is high, it’s hard to know exactly how many people you should hire,” Ullrich said.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment is borne out by businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management, who continue to express frustration over Trump’s significant policy changes and their ensuing effects on demand and planning.\n \n\n   \n  “Client demand in professional services remains steady, though decision-making timelines are lengthening due to continued economic uncertainty and interest-rate concerns,” one business said in ISM’s September services survey.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed is set to announce its latest monetary policy decision at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting ending on October 29, with a post-meeting news conference by Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET that day.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/russia-air-attack-kyiv-ukraine-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:58:00-04:00","title":"Deadly Russian Air Attacks Force Power Cuts Across Ukraine, as Trump-Putin Summit Shelved","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia launched a large-scale air attack on Ukraine, using drones, missiles, and fighter jets, targeting key cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv.

October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russia launched a large-scale air attack on Ukraine early Wednesday, causing power outages across most of the country, setting homes ablaze and killing at least six people, including a six-month-old baby, Ukrainian authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  The attack, which involved drones, missiles and fighter jets, targeted vast swathes of the country, including the capital Kyiv, and came as uncertainty swirled over a proposed Putin-Trump summit . \n \n\n   \n  CNN reported Tuesday, citing a Trump administration official, that there were “no plans” for such a meeting in the immediate future. Trump said later he didn’t want the summit to be “a waste of time,” despite the US president saying last week the two leaders would be meeting in Budapest, Hungary, “within two weeks or so, pretty quick.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite Trump’s comments on Tuesday, Moscow said the following day that preparations were continuing.\n \n\n   \n  “Preparations for the summit are ongoing. They could take various forms,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, according to state news agency RIA Novosti, adding that there were “no significant obstacles” to the Russia-US top-level meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said energy infrastructure, as well as “ordinary cities” were targeted in Wednesday’s attacks. The strikes had killed six people and wounded 17 across Ukraine, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Another night proving that Russia does not feel enough pressure for dragging out the war,” Zelensky said on X.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s state-owned energy operator Ukrenergo said emergency power cuts have been introduced across most regions of Ukraine because of the attack.\n \n\n   \n  DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said there was “significant” damage at one of its facilities in the Odesa region, and that energy workers were working to restore power.\n \n\n   \n  Several residential areas in Ukraine’s capital and the broader Kyiv region were struck, sparking fires in high-rises as residents scrambled to escape, according to city officials.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed and 10 had to be rescued after debris from a drone attack hit a 16-story residential building in Kyiv’s Dniprovskiy district, igniting a fire, according to Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko and the Kyiv city office.\n \n\n   \n  A woman, a 12 year old girl and a six-month-old baby were killed in Brovary district, east of Kyiv, after strikes caused their home to catch fire, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of Kyiv regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n  An 83-year-old woman was rescued from a burning house in the same district, Kalashnyk said.\n \n\n   \n  As of 12.40 p.m. local time, a total of 25 people had been injured in Kyiv city alone due to the overnight Russian attacks, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city’s military administration. More than 10 in the city have been hospitalized, including four children, Tkachenko said.\n \n\n   \n  In northeastern Kharkiv, a 40-year-old man was killed in Russian strikes, according to Oleh Synehubov, head of the region’s military administration, adding that six people had been injured.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky, who was visiting Norway and Sweden to discuss defense cooperation on Wednesday, said a Russian drone struck a kindergarten in Kharkiv, “after a night of massive attacks.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “All children have been evacuated and are in shelters. According to preliminary information, many are experiencing acute stress reactions.”\n \n\n   \n  In his daily address Wednesday, Zelensky said Trump’s call for Ukraine and Russia to stop at the current frontlines was a “good compromise,” but added he doubted Putin would support it.\n \n\n   \n  Katarina Maternovak, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, described a “night of horror” overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I spent that night on the floor of my hotel bathroom, turned into a shelter.

for ‘all interactions’ between military officials and Congress \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:47 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is barring nearly all Defense Department personnel, including military commanders, from talking to Congress or state lawmakers unless they have received prior approval from the agency’s office of legislative affairs, according to a memo signed this month by  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth  and obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Unauthorized engagements with Congress by [Defense Department] personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives,” says the memo.\n \n\n   \n  The directive applies to the civilian leaders of each military branch, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all combatant commanders and Defense Intelligence offices. The memo, dated October 15, does carve out an exception for the Pentagon Inspector General office, the agency’s internal watch dog.\n \n\n   \n  Breaking Defense  first reported  the details of the policy.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told CNN that the memo is “a pragmatic step to internally review the Department’s processes for communicating with Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Department intends to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency,” Parnell said. “This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information.”\n \n\n   \n  The memo is the latest in a series of steps by Hegseth to control information at the Pentagon and how the Pentagon communicates with those outside the agency. Hegseth,  whose tenure  has been beleaguered by leaks, has also moved to restrict engagement by Defense Department personnel with think tanks or other outside events and conferences. The memo was signed the same day that dozens of reporters  turned in their badges  rather than sign a document the Pentagon had produced that included restrictions on their work.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Pentagon official told CNN that the memo is consistent with longstanding Defense Department policy that has not been enforced in the past. A 2006-era directive states that all legislative activities “shall be centrally directed and carefully coordinated with the [assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs] prior to execution,” and that the assistant secretary would have “overall supervision” of legislative affairs for the department.\n \n\n   \n  And while the memo says explicitly that engagements must be coordinated or approved with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs), the senior official said some engagements can also be approved by the military services’ legislative offices instead of pushing them all the way up to the Pentagon’s legislative affairs office.\n \n\n   \n  However, a separate defense official told CNN on Wednesday that further internal guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense made clear the policy would restrict and centralize all communications with elected officials, and that even service legislative affairs staffers would need approval from OSD before responding to congressional inquiries.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not business as usual … They have been very clear across the military that this is a restriction, and they want to control it all centrally,” the defense official said.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says the Pentagon “relies on a collaborative and close partnership with Congress to achieve our legislative goals,” which requires “coordination of alignment of Department messaging.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously reported that Congress has had limited engagement with Hegseth to the frustration of lawmakers and staffers; a Senate aide told CNN there has been “significantly less” communication than what lawmakers expect.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways the memo is reminiscent of efforts by other administrations to control engagement with Congress, the Senate aide told CNN. For past administrations that has been in the form of a temporary pause in interactions or review.\n \n\n   \n  The aide said, the memo fits “a disturbing pattern of attempting to stifle communication with Congress and the public that is unique and characteristic to Pete Hegseth,” but that in practice it could be less restrictive than the language initially appears.\n \n\n   \n  “There is so much required and frankly beneficial interaction between Congress and the Department … There are very responsible and professional people who are doing their jobs and liaising with Congress, and 99% of it is business as usual,” the aide said. “I think this is a bad misunderstanding and frankly just another example of their paranoia to try to clamp down in this way.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior Pentagon official said the memo is not meant to be restrictive, but an effort to coordinate the Pentagon’s messaging to Congress to avoid mistakes like officials contradicting themselves to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  “When we go and we don’t coordinate our messaging, we run the risk of being in direct conflict with our budget request and our proposals on behalf of the Department,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been frustration with officials who are not in legislative affairs responding to questions from lawmakers or staffers on Capitol Hill, who are “answering on behalf of the Department and they’re not coordinating their messaging,” the senior official said.\n \n\n   \n  A former senior Pentagon official pointed to the logistical challenges of doing what the memo says is required, telling CNN that the Defense Department does thousands of engagements with Congress and state officials a month, talking with staffers regularly on everything from personnel and military installation issues to operational details. It would be logistically challenging to get prior approval and coordination for every one of those engagements.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says that the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, Dane Hughes, will conduct a review of all congressional affairs activities and submit a report to Hegseth detailing how to streamline activities, current issues with the congressional engagement process and more.\n \n\n   \n  Hughes said in a memo signed October 17 that he would be convening a working group as part of his review and directed senior leaders and combatant commanders to provide a senior official from their office who oversees legislative functions to participate.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/graham-platner-tattoo-senate-candidate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:07:00-04:00","title":"Maine Senate Candidate Platner Says Tattoo Recognized as Nazi Symbol Has Been Covered","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maine, has covered a skull and crossbones tattoo he obtained in 2007 while in Croatia, as it has been widely recognized as a symbol associated with Nazi police.

cuts are fueling the rise of the far right globally, the UN finds \n       \n  By Ana Nicolaci da Costa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:43 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Cuts to social protection for people living in poverty have created “fertile ground” for far-right movements around the world, according to a United Nations report.\n \n\n   \n  Popular support for the far right has grown globally in recent years. In Europe,  Giorgia Meloni  became Italy’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini in 2022, while the far-right  Alternative for Germany  is now Germany’s largest opposition party. The Trump administration has  endorsed far-right parties  in Europe, and in Argentina far-right libertarian Javier Milei won the presidency in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The UN report, unveiled Wednesday, says changes to  welfare systems  have made it harder to access benefits by tightening eligibility rules or imposing stricter conditions, contributing to the kind of economic precarity and alienation that drives people to the far right.\n \n\n   \n  “These punitive welfare systems increase economic insecurity, erode trust in public institutions and leave millions feeling humiliated and abandoned by mainstream politics,” the report’s author, Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said in a  press release .\n \n\n   \n  “It is in this void that far-right populists thrive, presenting themselves as champions of those left behind by the ‘elite.’”\n \n\n   \n  But he warned: “Their agenda is not to empower people in poverty – it is to further dismantle protections for their own gain.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s  One Big Beautiful Bill Act  illustrates this type of “populism of the privileged,” the report argues. The package includes historic reductions to America’s safety net programs, particularly Medicaid and food stamps, and at the same time slashes taxes, resulting “in a massive transfer” of resources from the poorest households to the richest.\n \n\n   \n  Growing gaps in incomes are a “major factor” explaining the rise of right-wing populism, says the 19-page report, citing several studies, including one that established “an almost perfect correlation” between income inequality and support for populist parties.\n \n\n   \n  The report also notes European Social Surveys – tracking public attitudes, beliefs and behavior – which show that there is a 25% chance unemployed people at the lowest levels of jobless benefits will vote for the far right versus 15% for those who are employed.\n \n\n   \n  Higher pension levels, better child allowances and minimum wage legislation also have a “statistically measurable impact” in reducing the likelihood of a vote for the far right.\n \n\n   \n  “Thousands of people in poverty I speak with tell me they feel stigmatized and monitored rather than supported,” De Schutter said. “Unless social protection is taken seriously as a human right, far-right populists will continue to reap what has been sown.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/melania-trump-ukrainian-children-putin","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:08:00-04:00","title":"‘Language matters’: Advocates worry about Melania Trump’s rhetoric around returned Ukrainian children","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump has publicly advocated for the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces, engaging in direct communication with President Vladimir Putin.

rhetoric around returned Ukrainian children \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:08 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While praising  first lady Melania Trump’s  work to return Ukrainian children from Russian captivity,  President Donald Trump  last week seemed to downplay the estimates of the number of children allegedly abducted since the war began.\n \n\n   \n  Seated across the table in the White House Cabinet Room, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not try to correct his counterpart, nor did he answer a reporter’s question about whether he appreciated the American first lady’s efforts. Instead, he turned, cocked his head and silently nodded.\n \n\n   \n  The moment underscored deep sensitivity around a complex issue that the first lady has sought to resolve through direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Melania Trump, who has made the well-being and safety of children a priority, advocacy on this issue appeared to be a natural fit and an opportunity to use her massive global platform to make a difference.\n \n\n   \n  But in the week after  she announced  the return of eight Ukrainian children to their families, some advocates who have lauded the children’s return also raised concern in conversations with CNN about the way the first lady got involved — and especially her passive-voice characterization of how the children ended up in Russia, fearing that it will only end up playing to Putin.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from the White House earlier this month, the first lady described “Ukrainian children residing in Russia” and said they’d been “displaced to the Russian Federation because of front-line fighting” — but did not talk about the war crime that many advocates see in Moscow’s alleged abduction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is moving very carefully, but everyone is clear on the point that the first lady’s office needs to hear: Thank you — but it is 35,000 kids, not seven or eight,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, whose Ukraine Conflict Observatory is operating on private donations through the end of the year after the Trump administration  cut its funding .\n \n\n   \n  “It is kids who were taken as a war crime and kids who are being militarized and were abducted by a state — not lost in the war. Language matters,” Raymond said.\n \n\n   \n  A  September report  from the Yale lab found children have been taken to at least 210 locations, including military bases, orphanages and camps, where they have been reeducated in alignment with pro-Russian narratives and in some cases trained for combat. Many of them have had their identities changed, making them increasingly difficult to track over time.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady’s language ignores the reality of the situation — and could play in Putin’s favor, some advocates for the children told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Bill Taylor, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, applauded Melania Trump’s personal involvement while also noting that Putin likely has ulterior motives.\n \n\n   \n  “Every returned child is wonderful for that family and that child, so that is good. But there are more than 19,000 of these, and I do think that Putin is cynically using this in an attempt to make the Trumps more sympathetic to him,” Taylor told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The estimates of how many children have been allegedly abducted vary, depending on the source and who’s being counted.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump, a day after a  two-hour phone call  with the Russian leader last week, offered his own take on the number. “Some people say it’s 20,000 and some people say it’s 300,” he said during his Friday meeting with Zelensky at the White House. “So, nobody really knows, but she felt very strongly about the children.”\n \n\n   \n  Taylor doesn’t doubt Melania Trump’s compassion for the Ukrainian children — but he does question the Russian leader’s.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the first lady is genuinely interested in getting the Ukrainian children home. But the fact is that Putin is not. He could return all of these kids and end the war tomorrow if he wanted,” Taylor said.\n \n\n   \n  Melania Trump’s efforts came amid mounting pressure from the Ukrainians, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers and evangelicals to get the Trump administration involved in returning the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska, for example,  traveled to New York  last month with a pressing mission to raise awareness among the international community. Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, she warned that at the current rate, it would take 50 years to return the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  The American first lady, who employs a skeletal staff, kept the news of the eight children’s release to an extremely small circle of aides before revealing it publicly, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Some Ukrainians at the working level who have been focused on the issue were taken aback by the first lady’s involvement. They welcomed her efforts, but worried about Putin working with her only as part of an effort to downplay the enormity of the problem, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian official dismissed those concerns and said Volodymyr Zelensky was grateful for the US first lady’s intervention.\n \n\n   \n  In her initial announcement, Trump said she and Putin “have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children for the past three months.” She pointed to backchannel meetings and calls following a letter she wrote to the Russian leader, hand-delivered by her husband in  Alaska in August , that obliquely referenced the “darkness” around children impacted by war.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, a group of key Senate Republicans and Democrats had been pushing for a  resolution  making the return of the abducted children a prerequisite for any negotiated peace agreement to end the war. But despite the first lady’s announcement, the White House has not yet stated a position on the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  While one Republican congressional aide said there is some skepticism regarding Melania Trump’s involvement, for now, there is no appetite on Capitol Hill to push the White House on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  “If there needs to be conversations with the White House on this, there will be, but I have no indication that Melania believes what Putin says,” the aide said, adding that there are some concerns about Putin using a direct line to the first lady to shift the narrative on the allegedly abducted children.\n \n\n   \n  Evangelical groups that have lobbied the White House and the first lady’s office on the issue praised Trump’s receptiveness and argued that the return of eight children was an important turning point.\n \n\n   \n  And Chelsea Sobolik, director of government relations at World Relief, an evangelical humanitarian organization, noted that the effort also marked a critical recognition from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Up until recently, Russia was denying this issue — or they were giving all these false narratives. So I think the fact that this is making waves at the top levels of our US government does mean there’s movement. I view this as a first step, not a last step. There’s so much more work that needs to be done,” Sobolik said.\n \n\n   \n  She signed onto a letter from a group of evangelical leaders thanking Trump — but also encouraging her to keep her foot on the gas.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to urge the Trump Administration to ensure that this remains a central issue and that all estimated 35,000 children are returned as a precondition to any peace talks,” they  wrote .\n \n\n   \n   This headline has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-pro-bowl-moves-to-super-bowl-week","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:43:00-04:00","title":"The NFL’s Pro Bowl is moving to Super Bowl week","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NFL has announced that the 2026 Pro Bowl will be moved to Super Bowl LX week, taking place on February 3, 2026, at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.

Delhi plunged into toxic darkness and world’s most polluted air \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul and Esha Mitra, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:21 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Around 20 million people in  India’s  capital woke up on Wednesday breathing the most polluted air of any major city in the world, a day after celebrations for the  Diwali festival , during which revelers typically set off fireworks and firecrackers.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday, New Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration – a measure of pollutants in the air – was more than 40 times the World Health Organization’s annualized guideline level, according to Swiss air quality monitoring company IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi grapples with severe year-round pollution, but the winter months are typically worst, when millions of farmers in surrounding regions burn stubble in their fields to clear the way for the next crop.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp deterioration in air quality this week comes following celebrations for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which traditionally involves the widespread use of firecrackers which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, as well as harmful heavy metals.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, authorities enacted a complete ban on making, selling or using firecrackers in New Delhi, citing hazardous pollution levels.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of so-called “green” firecrackers – which manufacturers claim are less polluting – but only within a certain time window. However, residents reported that this curfew was poorly enforced, with people bursting firecrackers long after the deadline, and that “non-green” firecrackers still appeared to be available.\n \n\n   \n  “Year on year, it goes from bad to worse,” said resident Anushka Singh.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old graphic designer said she usually stays at home at Diwali with her dog, to “help him through the incessant noise that doesn’t stop until late at night or early morning.”\n \n\n   \n  She described how her throat becomes scratchy, and her eyes begin to burn as she steps out of her home the day after Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  “Living in Delhi is a pain… I just wish that given the decades of data we would at least have stricter rules, ones that are actually implemented,” Singh said.\n \n\n   \n  Chandra Tandon, 52, who owns a corner store in the capital, said bursting crackers are “part of the fun and happens once a year,” but agreed that it becomes “difficult” for people who must endure the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  “I was breathing in those fumes throughout and it’s definitely not good,” she said. “It would be good if we left the crackers burning to the kids… If you’ve lived in Delhi long enough, you know how bad it gets every year with the pollution. So, adults at least should do their part.”\n \n\n   \n    A long-term crisis\n \n\n   \n  Despite the city being the political heart of the country, officials have had little success in cleaning up Delhi’s toxic air.\n \n\n   \n  Previous attempts to curb pollution have included sprinkling water on the roads, restricting traffic by requiring vehicles with odd or even license plates to travel on alternating days, and constructing in 2018 two smog towers worth 200 million rupees ($2.4 million), intended to act as giant air purifiers.\n \n\n   \n  But a lack of strict enforcement and coordination means progress has been slow, experts suggest.\n \n\n   \n  India is also desperate to fuel its booming economy and meet the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, three Indian cities, including New Delhi, were ranked among the world’s most polluted, according to air quality tracker IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  Kolkata in the east was in fourth place, while Mumbai in the west ranked number 10.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/former-president-sarkozy-police-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"09:23:00-04:00","title":"Former French President Sarkozy Accompanied by Police Officers Overnight as He Starts Prison Sentence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began serving a five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors.

criminal conspiracy, would continue to receive protection in prison on account of his status and “given the threats he faces.”\n \n\n   \n  The minister, who was speaking Wednesday to radio station Europe 1, added that the safety measures would remain in effect “as long as it is deemed necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m in charge of the security of individuals, of high-ranking officials,” Nuñez said as he explained that it was his decision to extend Sarkozy’s protection while he serves his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a decision aimed at ensuring his security in addition, obviously, to everything implemented by the prison administration,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Nicolas Peyrin, deputy secretary general of the prison guards’ union, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that the additional security

\n        10:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Astronomers have spotted a quasi-moon near Earth — and the small space rock has likely been hanging out near our planet unseen by telescopes for about 60 years, according to new research.\n \n\n   \n  The newly discovered celestial object, named 2025 PN7, is a type of near-Earth asteroid that orbits the sun but sticks close to our planet. Like our world, 2025 PN7 takes one year to complete an orbit around the sun.\n \n\n   \n  Quasi-moons differ from temporary mini-moons that occasionally orbit Earth such as  2024 PT5 , which circled the planet for two months in 2024 and could be an ancient fragment that was blasted off of our primary moon.\n \n\n   \n  The newly found 2025 PN7 is just one of a handful of known quasi-moons with orbits near our planet, including  Kamo‘oalewa , which is also thought to be an ancient lunar fragment. Kamo‘oalewa is one of the destinations of  China’s Tianwen-2 mission  launched in May, which aims to collect and return samples from the space rock in 2027. Currently, there are seven known quasi-satellites near Earth, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  The Pan-STARRS observatory located on the Haleakala volcano in Hawaii captured observations of 2025 PN7 on August 29. Archival data revealed that the object has been in an Earth-like orbit for decades.\n \n\n   \n  The quasi-moon managed to escape the notice of astronomers for so long because it is small and faint, said Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, a researcher on the faculty of mathematical sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid who recently authored a paper about the space rock. The paper was published on   September 2 in the journal  Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society , which is for timely non-peer-reviewed astronomical observations.\n \n\n   \n  The space rock swings within 186,000 miles (299,337 kilometers) of us during its closest pass of our planet,   de la Fuente Marcos said. For reference, 2025 PN7 is 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth on average, according to  NASA .\n \n\n   \n  “It can only be detected by currently available telescopes when it gets close to our planet as it did this summer,” de la Fuente Marcos explained. “Its visibility windows are few and far between. It is a challenging object.”\n \n\n   \n  Finding and studying quasi-moons can reveal more about our corner of the universe, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Solar System is full of surprises so we keep looking,” he wrote in an email. “For Earth’s neighborhood, the existence of 2025 PN7 suggests that there may not exist a lower limit to the size of a quasi-satellite.”\n \n\n   \n    A temporary companion\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are still trying to figure out 2025 PN7’s size. About 98 feet (30 meters) across is a reasonable estimate, de la Fuente Marcos said. It also has the potential to be 62 feet (19 meters) in diameter, according to  EarthSky .\n \n\n   \n  The space rock is currently the smallest-known quasi-moon to have orbited near Earth, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, 2025 PN7 switches between a closer, more circular Earthlike orbit and a horseshoe orbit, similar to Kamoʻoalewa’s. During the horseshoe orbit, the space rock can reach a distance of 185 million miles (297 million kilometers) from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  The quasi-moon is expected to remain in its current near-Earth orbit for about another 60 years before the gravitational tug of the sun pulls it back into a horseshoe orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Questions remain about the space rock’s composition, which is currently unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on what little we know so far, it’s almost certainly a rocky and natural object — sometimes old satellites and rocket junk end up in these very-near-Earth kinds of orbits, but we can often tell ‘natural’ (e.g., asteroidal) from ‘artificial’ (e.g., satellite) based on how their orbits evolve on short timescales,” wrote Dr. Teddy Kareta, assistant professor in the department of astrophysics and planetary science at Villanova University, in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Kareta, who has previously studied mini-moons and quasi-moons, was not involved in the research   and said   bad weather has thus far interfered with his plans to observe it.\n \n\n   \n  While 2025 PN7, like Kamoʻoalewa, may also be a piece of the moon, more data is needed to confirm that, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  De la Fuente Marcos believes that 2025 PN7 came from the Arjuna asteroid belt. Unlike the main asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the Arjuna asteroid is not a distinct belt. Instead, they are a group of small space rocks that have orbits around the sun similar to Earth’s.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, de la Fuente Marcos had proposed that mini-moon 2024 PT5 was also an Arjuna asteroid that could have come from Earth’s moon before becoming part of the belt.\n \n\n   \n  “Now we know that material ejected during lunar impacts may contribute members to the Arjuna secondary asteroid belt,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though   quasi-moons and mini-moons can closely approach our planet, they don’t typically pose an impact risk for Earth,   so 2025 PN7 is no threat, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Sending missions to investigate quasi-moons, as Tianwen-2 is expected to do with Kamoʻoalewa, could reveal the true origin and history of these intriguing space rocks — and provide other opportunities as well, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “These asteroids are relatively easy to access for unmanned missions and can be used to test planetary exploration technologies with a relatively modest investment,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/climate/extreme-weather-disaster-trump-noaa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump ‘retired’ a database tracking the most expensive weather disasters.

Now it’s back — and finding over $100B in losses \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters Database, which the Trump administration  “retired” in May , has relaunched outside of the government using the same methodology. In its first update at the new site, the database shows that the first six months of 2025 have been the most expensive first six months of any year since 1980.\n \n\n   \n  The Billion-Dollar Database tracks the financial costs of property and other infrastructure destroyed by extreme weather disasters in the United States, focusing on events that caused $1 billion or more in damages. So far, 2025 has racked up $101.4 billion in such losses. The climate research nonprofit Climate Central  now hosts the database  and makes this information available to insurers, policy makers, broadcast meteorologists and ordinary citizens.\n \n\n   \n  The database was rebuilt and will be maintained by its previous administrator Adam Smith, a former economist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency which used to host it. Smith found 14 billion-dollar disasters in the first half of this year, including the Los Angeles wildfires in January and a tornado outbreak across the central US in mid-March.   More billion-dollar disasters are likely to be added to the list before 2025 is over.   \n \n\n   \n  Without the database, the public would have no easy way to track the cost of extreme weather events, many of which are becoming more common and severe because of climate change.\n \n\n   \n  But climate change is not the sole reason the database shows an upward trend in both the number of billion-dollar disasters and the amount they cost. Population growth and an increase in the number of buildings in harm’s way are the dominant factors, according to Smith.   \n \n\n   \n  “Either way you look at it, the rise in damages relates to human activities and choices, and so you need to use information in context to better evaluate future choices,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has particularly increased in the last decade, Smith said, occurring nearly twice as often compared to the 30-year inflation-adjusted average.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1980 and 2024, there were nine such disasters on average each year. In the past five years, that annual average has jumped to 24. The  record for a single year  was 28 events in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  In the first six months of 2025, the list of billion-dollar disasters is mostly comprised of severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks, reflecting the conspicuous absence of landfalling hurricanes so far this season.\n \n\n   \n  However, the LA fires in January cost $61.2 billion, making them the costliest wildfires in US history, according to Climate Central.\n \n\n   \n  Climate Central hired Smith after the NOAA economist took early retirement this year, as part of the Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal bureaucracy.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA’s official list stops   at the end of   2024. Climate Central’s version picks up in 2025 and will continue from there.\n \n\n   \n  The relaunched list uses the same methodology as the old NOAA one, Smith said. It relies on data from insurance companies and other sources, some of which is proprietary, to tally up total losses. The decision to discontinue the database was due in part to Smith’s exit from NOAA. It would have been a difficult task for the agency to continue without him, but it could have done it, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The choice to discontinue the database was in keeping with the administration’s focus on cutting climate change datasets and programs across federal agencies. But there were calls for it to continue from multiple sectors.\n \n\n   \n  “This dataset was simply too important to stop being updated. Demand for its revival actually came from several aspects of industry and society, including decision makers in the insurance, reinsurance risk space, academia, Congress and local communities,” Smith said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/jesse-jackson-1988-campaign","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:42:00-04:00","title":"The inside story of how Jesse Jackson almost became America’s first Black presidential nominee","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jesse Jackson Sr., a civil rights leader and outsider, ran for president in 1984 and 1988, challenging the Democratic Party to become more inclusive and economically populist.

Jesse Jackson Sr., a civil rights leader and political outsider, ran for president in two groundbreaking campaigns that changed American politics. A son of the segregated South who went from nothing to eventually becoming one of the most well-known public figures in America, Jackson’s outsider political campaigns challenged the Democratic Party to reform its nominating process, more equitably include women and non-white voters, and appeal to Americans on a platform of economic populism. \n \n\n   \n   In 1984, Jackson lost the nomination but started a movement he called the “Rainbow Coalition.” By 1988, Jackson was a force to be reckoned with. This time, he faced a crowded primary of established political hands. The race, led by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, was heated from the beginning. Jackson, a polarizing but outsized figure, was a magnet for media attention. In both 1984 and 1988, Jackson appealed to Black voters in the South, who formed a critical voting bloc in the Democratic primary. But this time, his appeal among white voters was growing as well. In March 1988, Jackson came from behind to win the Michigan Democratic caucuses and set off a panic in his party. For the first time, the party and Jackson himself, began contemplating: What would happen if he became the Democratic nominee for president? \n \n\n   \n   Below is an excerpt from Abby Phillip’s  new book , “A Dream Deferred,” which publishes on October 28.  \n \n\n   \n  Jesse Jackson convened half a dozen of his closest advisers in his Chicago home. For the first time, he was beginning to lay out what he would have to do to build an actual presidency if he were to become the nominee.\n \n\n   \n  There was plenty of fear, too. In his own mind, the gravity of the presidency — or the potential of it — descended on him all at once. This was the same man who wore a bulletproof jacket provided to him by the Secret Service as a matter of course during both his campaigns. But for the first time, he was discussing with his closest aides what they would do about cabinet positions and White House appointments.\n \n\n   \n  “He was seriously thinking for the first time, ‘Wait a second, this could be doable,’” recalled campaign manager Jerry Austin, a white Jewish man from New York  with a long history of political campaigns in the heartland.\n \n\n   \n  “By that time, we had some momentum, and the issues that we raised were resonating,” Jackson said. “Our issues were on time, issues about economic justice and shared economic security, a connection between family farms and urban workers, how blacks and whites had to relate together, and browns. So, it was in full gear. We used to call it ‘poor campaign, rich message.’ Our message was winning.”\n \n\n   \n  A similar realization had come to Democratic Party officials, who watched in shock as Jackson beat Dukakis 2–1 in a key industrial midwestern state. The Michigan victory also would, potentially briefly, leave Jackson with an outright delegate lead — a nightmare scenario for some in the party. “The party is up against an extraordinary endgame,” Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told The New York Times. “If this guy has more convention votes than anyone else, how can we not nominate him? But how can we nominate him?”\n \n\n   \n  Others were blunter, though unwilling to put their names on the record. They whispered about denying Jackson the nomination if he entered the convention with the most delegates. “I’m not saying that he can do that,” one anonymous party veteran told the Times. “But if he could, we would be in an impossible situation. We’d have the choice of turning our backs on Jesse, and alienating the Blacks, or nominating him and almost certainly losing in November.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dukakis campaign  was suddenly under the microscope. The Massachusetts governor had plenty going for him organizationally, but almost nothing that gripped the hearts of primary voters. “We must acknowledge the strength of Jackson’s message,” one of Dukakis’s supporters, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, said. On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers were skeptical about Dukakis the man and the uninspiring campaign he was running. Even if they wanted to “stop Jackson,” they were trapped. They were deathly afraid of being called racist for opposing a Black candidate but were convinced that if Jackson were the nominee, the Republicans would run away with the race in historic fashion.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They were buying into his campaign’\n \n\n   \n  The relationship between Jackson and Austin, his campaign manager, had been cordial but uneasy until this point. Unlike many people around Jackson, Austin was not a longtime loyalist. Yet the victory in Michigan seemed to act as a pressure valve releasing some of the distrust Jackson may have felt for Austin—at least temporarily.\n \n\n   \n  The campaign finally seemed to be getting its footing. With Austin’s arrival and a more sophisticated finance team being brought on, Jackson was well positioned to take advantage of the financial windfalls that came from his better-than-expected performance on Super Tuesday. He was continuing to run, by far, the leanest of the campaigns still in the field. But the sudden uptick in fundraising among smaller donations and larger checks caught the attention of his rivals. The campaign began using mail solicitations to fundraise. And with each campaign victory, raising money from wealthy donors became easier.\n \n\n   \n  On that front, Jackson was playing catch-up with the other, more establishment candidates in the race. But where none of them could touch his candidacy was with his small-dollar appeal. It was one of the great gifts Jackson had, taken straight from the pulpit. At rallies and campaign events in churches and high school gyms, the ask would start at a thousand dollars. Could anyone spare a thousand? Not one hand in the room went up—nor did Jackson expect that any would. The ask then went down to five hundred, then to fifty, then twenty and ten, until virtually every hand in the room was raised and people put what they had into the collection hat.\n \n\n   \n  “Afterward, I said to him, ‘Why do you start asking for a thousand? There’s nobody in this church with a thousand dollars,’” Austin recalled. “And he said, ‘When I get to “Who will give me something?” everybody would give me something.’”\n \n\n   \n  “They were buying into his campaign,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n    Tranquilizing the establishment\n \n\n   \n  It was past time for Jackson to begin to calm the nerves of the party establishment in Washington. With the help of former DNC chairman John C. White and Bert Lance, former budget director for President Jimmy Carter, the campaign gathered around thirty-five Democrats representing a cross section of fundraisers, party officials, and tastemakers in a ballroom at the Jefferson Hotel in DC. Jackson worked the room. The aim was to “raise the comfort level” of party officials. One attendee called it a “tranquilizer” for the Democratic Party chattering class.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of those kinds of people wind up making up public opinion in a very small subset,” said Ann Lewis. “This was about, at the most basic level, relieving people’s anxiety because I consistently thought Jesse had been so underestimated and not quite caricatured, but unfairly portrayed by the press. … And for people to see him as he really was, which was this smart, thoughtful guy and someone who really wanted the Democratic Party to succeed. They didn’t know that.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson was buoyant as he went into Wisconsin ahead of its April 5 primary. The crowds seemed to validate the growing interest in his candidacy. He and his campaign were confident that he could appeal to the state’s college towns and urban communities. Jackson had high hopes for the state, where his rallies had been enthusiastically received even in white farming communities.\n \n\n   \n  They held a rally on the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Paul Wellstone, who would later become a progressive US senator from Minnesota, was Jackson’s state director there. A crowd nearly the size of the town’s population of 2,800 showed up in rural Amery, Wisconsin, to hear Jackson speak. As they gathered on the Blu-Fay dairy farm, there was almost as much appreciation for Jackson showing up there as for his message. “The truly impressive thing is here’s a Black man coming up to rural Wisconsin, to a community where all the Blacks could fill that barn, and there would still be a lot of room,” said Skip Shireman, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher.\n \n\n   \n  There was interest, no doubt, in Jackson’s candidacy and message, but the campaign was ill-equipped to capture that curiosity and transform it into votes. There were memorable messages, to be sure — “We will choose farms over arms in this generation” — but Jackson was characteristically short on specifics. If anything, his candidacy was beginning to be a repository for disenchantment with the rest of the Democratic field. “The man has something to say,” said Bob Jahnke, an electric plant worker who came out to see Jackson. “We had (US Rep. Dick) Gephardt and Dukakis here last Saturday. Gephardt had somewhat of a message, but Dukakis didn’t say much.”\n \n\n   \n  In more moderate La Crosse, old party hands who had thrown their support behind Dukakis or Gore found discord in their own homes. “My mother is voting for Jesse Jackson, my sister is voting for Jesse Jackson,” a state representative who had thrown his hat in for Gore told a reporter. “I can’t even convince my own family to vote for Al Gore.”\n \n\n   \n  The energy around Jackson’s candidacy was unmistakable and set his opponents’ more traditional campaigns in stark relief. As the April 5 primary approached, Dukakis was feeling the pressure to better define himself and his candidacy in the minds of uninspired voters. “I have no interest in being known as the Great Communicator,” he said. “I want to be known as the Great Builder. I want to make the American dream come alive again.” \n \n\n   \n    Electability concerns win out\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s growing populist appeal was rising just as rapidly as the panic among establishment Democrats and the party faithful. A U.S. News & World Report poll put a Jackson-led presidential ticket far behind Vice President George H.W. Bush in a general election. Meanwhile, a Dukakis-led ticket with Jackson as vice president would narrowly beat Bush. The survey quantified persistent reservations among the electorate about Jackson’s candidacy. Those two forces came crashing together in spectacular fashion on Election Night in Wisconsin.\n \n\n   \n  Thanks to Michigan, the expectations were sky high for Jackson. Austin’s strategy banked on defying expectations by overperforming among white voters in a state where Jackson could not necessarily rely on a large Black vote for credibility. But the Michigan victory changed all that. It refocused attention in the media on the question of “electability” and set victory as the standard that Jackson had to meet.\n \n\n   \n  By Election Day, the tides had turned, and Dukakis pulled out a decisive victory.\n \n\n   \n  “We got creamed,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of securing an easy victory that his large, enthusiastic crowds suggested, Jackson finished second. In a poll around the primary, about a third of primary voters said management skills and the candidate’s experience were the main factors that determined their vote—and that group overwhelmingly supported Dukakis.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin was “the end of the hope that you might actually have this miracle take place,” Borosage said. Dukakis’s message of “competence not charisma” worked. Jackson performed better with white voters, but any momentum he was hoping for after Michigan was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “In Wisconsin there were people who would have voted for Jesse but didn’t want him to be the nominee because they didn’t think he could win,” Austin said. “Dukakis was a safe haven.”\n \n\n   \n   Despite a groundswell of grassroots support for Jackson’s insurgent campaign, it was never matched by elected Democrats and party leaders. Jackson finished second to Dukakis in the 1988 primary but secured leverage at the Democratic National Convention. He used it to push through a series of changes to the Democratic Party’s platform and rules, including one that would become pivotal in another primary where a Black candidate, Barack Obama, sought the nomination against a more establishment figure. Jackson hoped that he would be considered seriously as running mate to Dukakis. The two men and their wives met at Dukakis’ Brookline, Massachusetts, home in the lead-up to the convention. But ultimately, Dukakis chose a white Southerner, Sen.  Lloyd Bentsen  of Texas. After a sharply negative general election campaign against Vice President George H.W. Bush, Dukakis lost in an electoral landslide. \n \n\n   \n   The headline on this story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/entertainment/oscar-race-movies-so-far","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:26:00-04:00","title":"Oscar Nominations Are Already Three Months Away: Where the Race Stands So Far","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article outlines the current state of the 2025 Oscar race, three months before the official nomination announcement.

Here’s where the race stands so far \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:26 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Where has 2025 gone? One way to mark the dizzying elapsing of time: The  Oscar  race is already coming into focus, now that we’re –  gulp  – three months out from nominations.\n \n\n   \n  The competition still has much time to take shape, but there are a few frontrunners emerging, starting with Paul Thomas Anderson’s recently released chaotic opus “One Battle After Another” – which has enjoyed the best word of mouth this year, notching an impressive critic score of 95 on both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. (“One Battle After Another” is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n \n\n   \n  But not far behind are several other titles, including many yet to be released, like “Sentimental Value,” “Marty Supreme,” “Hamnet,” “Bugonia” and “Wicked: For Good,” to name a few.\n \n\n   \n  A preliminary breakdown of top categories follows:\n \n\n   \n    Best picture\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 15 years since the Academy opened up this race to more than the previously fixed number of five nominees – vacillating between eight and ten best picture contenders, and  settling consistently on ten  for the last few years. This year, that leaves the field open to quite a few possibilities. First, there’s “One Battle After Another,” whose director Anderson has frequently attracted Oscar love over the years and is seemingly a shoe-in for scoring a nomination for the night’s top honor. Ryan Coogler’s period-horror hit “Sinners” (also a Warner Bros. Pictures production) is also a solid contender, despite coming out in the summer months, which is a window often overlooked by Academy voters.\n \n\n   \n  At this juncture, other buzzy films generating a fair amount of Oscar buzz are the English-, Norwegian- and Swedish-language “Sentimental Value” (out on November 7) starring Stellan Skarsgård and Elle Fanning, “Hamnet” (out November 27) featuring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and “Marty Supreme” (out on Christmas Day) with Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Let us also not overlook the Palme d’Or-winning  Iranian film “It was Just an Accident,”  out this month.\n \n\n   \n  In the “maybe…could be…you never know!” section, there’s summer actioner “F1,” Netflix’s “Jay Kelly” with George Clooney and  Guillermo del Toro-directed “Frankenstein.”  These are probably in the long-shot category, but hey, Hollywood loves a twist.\n \n\n   \n    Best actress\n \n\n   \n  The Academy certainly favors return nominees, but it also  can’t resist a new arrival . This year, look for newcomer Chase Infiniti – whose quietly explosive performance is at the center of “One Battle After Another” – to be in the conversation. And although not a newbie on the scene, acclaimed Norwegian performer Renate Reinsve could have a place in the race for her work as the resentful daughter of an estranged director in “Sentimental Value,” which would mark her first Oscar nod.\n \n\n   \n  As for returning favorites, there’s Buckley, who was nominated for best supporting actress in 2022 for “The Lost Daughter,” and is all but sure to receive one again this year for her lead role in Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” playing a grief-stricken mother and wife to one William Shakespeare (Mescal). It would also be a major upset if Cynthia Erivo isn’t again recognized for her performance as Elphaba in the sequel “Wicked: For Good,” even though the film has yet to be screened for most anyone.\n \n\n   \n  Other possible contenders who are not new to the Oscar race include Amanda Seyfried in “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Julia Roberts in “After the Hunt,” “Bugonia’s” Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence for “Die My Love.”\n \n\n   \n    Best actor\n \n\n   \n  Let’s assume we’re reserving one chair for “One Battle’s” Leonardo DiCaprio – already an Oscar-winner for 2015’s “The Revenant.” That leaves us four slots to play with in the best actor race.\n \n\n   \n  Actually, make that three, because “Narcos” actor Wagner Moura, who is making waves for his work in the Brazilian film “The Secret Agent,” already won best actor at Cannes for the espionage thriller. In the film, he plays a technology expert in late-’70s Recife who discovers he’s being targeted by some unsavory characters. Notable: Only  16 best actor winners from the ritzy Cannes fest  have gone on to be nominated for an Academy Award.\n \n\n   \n  The three other spots could go several ways. Michael B. Jordan, who plays twins with very different fates in “Sinners,” and Chalamet, who would be returning for a second consecutive Oscar nomination (and his third in total), are strong options.\n \n\n   \n  On their heels, however, might be “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White, whose portrayal of Bruce Springsteen in “Deliver Me from Nowhere” has certainly  generated press  and some voter buzz. Other potential nominees include   Dwayne Johnson for “The Smashing Machine,” Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon” – in which  he plays Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart  – and Jesse Plemons for his turn as a wild conspiracy theorist in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia.”\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actress\n \n\n   \n  The best supporting actress race is a tough one to predict, since as usual, there’s just so much to choose from. Amy Madigan, known to most for ’80s films like “Uncle Buck” and “Field of Dreams,” turned out a bonkers performance in this summer’s breakout elevated horror hit “Weapons” (also from Warner Bros.) and has appeared on several lists as a favorite to be nominated here. It would mark her second Oscar nomination in this same category in exactly 40 years, after 1985’s “Twice in a Lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  While horror doesn’t often get recognized by the Academy, the precedent has indeed been set – Ruth Gordon won Oscar gold in 1969 for playing a somewhat similar character in “Rosemary’s Baby,” and landmark genre films like “The Exorcist” and “Aliens” also received Academy recognition for the actresses who starred in those films.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of that, keep your eyes on Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall, who each shine in “One Battle After Another,” and Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas for their work in “Sentimental Value.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s too early to count out Ariana Grande, who will again portray Glinda in the upcoming “Wicked: For Good,” especially if the movie ends up being great.\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actor\n \n\n   \n  If Sean Penn gets a nomination for his mercenary-like villain Colonel Lockjaw in “One Battle,” he could very well end up joining an elite group of three-time Oscar winners that includes Meryl Streep, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jack Nicholson and Frances McDormand.\n \n\n   \n  But “Hamnet’s”   Mescal, a returning nominee following 2022’s “Aftersun,” also has a strong chance.   While several actors have gotten nominated for playing roles in films based on Shakespeare’s works, no one has been nominated for playing the man himself. (Yes, 1998’s “Shakespeare in Love” was showered with Academy love, but the Bard-playing actor Joseph Fiennes was not nominated.)\n \n\n   \n  Other potential contenders in this category could include Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value,” Adam Sandler for Netflix’s “Jay Kelly,” and Jeremy Strong – who was nominated last year for his chilling portrayal of Roy Cohn in “The Apprentice” – for “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere.”\n \n\n   \n  Oscar nominations will be unveiled on the morning of January 22, 2026. The 98th Academy Awards will be held on March 15.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/serbia-parliament-shots-fired-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:38:00-04:00","title":"Man seriously injured after shots fired outside Serbian parliament","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man was seriously injured in a shooting incident outside the Serbian parliament building in Belgrade on Wednesday, October 22, 2025.

Sununu enters GOP primary race in New Hampshire for the seat he lost in 2008 \n       \n  Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:04 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for US Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators: Republican Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again. I’m a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  National Republicans consider Sununu a strong candidate and one that allows them to go on the offensive as they look to hold their majority in the chamber next year.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in Ohio, Maine and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates. But Republicans are also on the offensive in places like Michigan, Georgia and now, increasingly, New Hampshire — and if they flip one of those seats it will likely put the chamber out of reach for Democrats until at least 2028.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu must first win the primary though, and his past opposition to President Donald Trump could be problematic. While Brown has aligned himself closely with Trump and served as his US ambassador to New Zealand, Sununu backed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, writing an op-ed calling Trump a “loser.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to win New Hampshire’s leadoff primary, but the state’s voters rejected him for a third time in the general election. And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor’s office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire’s congressional seats since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu served three terms in the US House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He was the chamber’s youngest member throughout his term, a fact he emphasized in a 2008 campaign ad that showed him sprinting up a steep mountain path.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s younger, faster, quicker,” a deep-voiced (and somewhat redundant) narrator intones. “Inexhaustible. Tireless. Energetic.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s now the same age Shaheen was when she defeated him and is 16 years older than US Rep. Chris Pappas, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security.\n \n\n   \n  Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Chris Pappas will stand up to corporate special interests and take on anyone to do what is best for New Hampshire, and that’s why Granite Staters will elect him to the US Senate next November,” campaign manager Rachel Petri said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Though Sununu has long been out of office, his name recognition remains high due to his family’s political prominence. His father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor and former White House chief of staff. One of his brothers,  Chris Sununu, served four terms as governor  and flirted with a Senate campaign of his own in 2021. He also shot down a bid this cycle, saying he had spoken to the White House but opted against it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/bessent-argentina-lifeline-warren","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Bessent calls $20 billion lifeline to Argentina a ‘mission-critical’ function of Treasury during shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the U.S. Treasury’s decision to finalize a $20 billion currency swap for Argentina during a federal government shutdown, calling it a 'mission-critical' function essential to global financial stability.

billion lifeline for Argentina using taxpayers’ funds during the government shutdown was an essential action for the agency, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  His remarks came in response to a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, who wrote to Bessent a week prior requesting an explanation as to why the Treasury Department was working on the Argentinian lifeline during a shutdown of the federal government that has restrained resources.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been forced to prioritize mission-critical efforts necessary to the discharge of the President’s constitutional duties — including national security and global financial stability,” Bessent wrote to Warren, in a letter the senator shared exclusively with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent  announced earlier this month  is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity. Effectively, though, it’s a loan from the US government.\n \n\n   \n  The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he’ll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month. Trump said last week future efforts to boost the Argentine economy would be contingent on the election results.\n \n\n   \n  But on top of questions Trump has faced on the rationale for an economic rescue of the South American country, a looming concern is whether the efforts have been successful.\n \n\n   \n  While the Argentine peso initially rose following Bessent’s announcement, the currency set a fresh low earlier this week, suggesting more work could be needed to stabilize it.\n \n\n   \n  Warren also questioned Treasury’s plans to work with private-sector banks to generate a $20 billion loan to Argentina on top of the $20 billion rescue package from the government.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent, in his response, did not directly address her questions regarding private-sector involvement.

More and more workers are using weight loss drugs. It’s costing their employers a fortune \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.\n \n\n   \n  The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual  Employer Health Benefits Survey , which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.\n \n\n   \n  Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also  limited Americans’ access  to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.\n \n\n   \n  Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.\n \n\n   \n  “Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”\n \n\n   \n  One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32 nd  place last year.\n \n\n   \n  A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”\n \n\n   \n  The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the  medications  would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.\n \n\n   \n  Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.\n \n\n   \n  However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.\n \n\n   \n    Rising premiums\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.\n \n\n   \n  But  coverage for 2026  could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/car-payments-late-default-subprime","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:46:00-04:00","title":"A significant group of Americans are falling behind on their car payments - an economic warning sign","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A significant rise in car loan delinquency among Americans with credit scores below 670 — now at 6.43%, double the rate from 2021 — signals deepening economic stress.

    \n  By Matt Egan, Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:46 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A key group of American borrowers is falling significantly behind on their car loans. It’s yet another sign that the US economy is forming some serious cracks, leaving the most vulnerable in financial distress.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers – those with credit scores below 670 – who are at least 60 days late on their car loans has doubled since 2021 to 6.43%, according to Fitch Ratings. That’s worse than during the past three recessions – during the Covid pandemic, the Great Recession or the dot-com bust.\n \n\n   \n  America’s current subprime delinquency rate is at the second-highest level since the early 1990s. The only time it was higher: this past January. Cars are being repossessed at the highest rate since the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a disturbing trend to economists: Car loans are typically the last payments that Americans are willing to miss. They’re too important to their lives: Cars are essential tools to get to work, drive families and access food.\n \n\n   \n    No room for error\n \n\n   \n   Record car prices  and  high interest rates , combined with other  inflationary pressures , have sent average auto payments to record levels and have put significant stress on car owners.\n \n\n   \n  Although the financial stress on subprime car borrowers has stabilized in 2025 after large increases in late payments and repossessions over the past two years, economists fear what might happen if the  labor market  grows considerably weaker and layoffs become more common.\n \n\n   \n  For subprime borrowers, the default rate – those whose cars have been or are about to be repossessed – which stood at nearly 10% in September, according to Cox Automotive data. That’s down from a year ago but above the long-term average.\n \n\n   \n  Those borrowers often have no choice but to default. They can’t sell their cars because they owe so much more than it is worth. They often have already missed payments on other obligations, such as mortgage payments or rent, as well as payments due on credit cards and student loans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no room for error,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.\n \n\n   \n    Surging costs\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of new car leases and more than three-quarters of new car loans made in the second quarter had monthly payments of $500 or more, and 46% of used car loans have payments of $500 or above, according to Experian. For new car loans, more than 17% have payments of more than $1,000.\n \n\n   \n  Repair costs have also surged – at a time when many are holding onto their cars for longer to avoid splurging on a new one. Motor vehicle  repair costs surged 15%  year-over-year in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s the most in nearly two years. And repair costs increased 5% between July and August, the biggest monthly increase on record.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, car insurance rates have increased significantly since the pandemic. In August, car insurance rose by the smallest annual rate in three years – but that still amounted to a hefty near-5% jump, well above the overall inflation rate.\n \n\n   \n    Consumer pain\n \n\n   \n  The increased costs of owning and maintaining a car aren’t happening in a vacuum: They’re taking place after years of rising prices at the supermarket and across the economy. And two years ago, many  student loan payments  that were paused during the pandemic became due again. A year ago, delinquent student loan payments started counting against credit scores again, pushing some borrowers into lower credit ratings that could raise the rates they were charged on other loans, including car loans.\n \n\n   \n  Elevated subprime delinquency rates demonstrate how beneath the surface of blockbuster stock market returns and strong overall economic growth, many consumers are hurting.\n \n\n   \n  Tellingly, Americans with stronger credit scores don’t appear to be struggling to make car payments. The delinquency rate among prime borrowers has increased significantly but remains very low at less than 0.5%.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no alarm bells going off for prime borrowers,” said Rod Chadehumbe, chief asset backed securities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The wide gap between delinquency rates of prime and subprime borrowers is another reminder of the so called K-shaped economy: Many Americans who have money in the stock market and own increasingly valuable homes are doing well and spending aggressively, but many others, especially lower-income consumers, are struggling to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  A number of lenders who specialize in subprime car loans expect a growing percentage of their clients to default and have their car repossessed, said Pamela Foohey, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in both auto finance and bankruptcies.\n \n\n   \n  The repo business has been quite active lately. Subprime lenders build GPS features into cars to make it easier for teams repossessing the vehicles to find them, she said. The lenders can even disable the ignition of the cars to prevent owners from driving them once they’ve defaulted on the loan.\n \n\n   \n  “The (repo) numbers indicate it’s probably close to the Great Recession in volume,” said George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, and is also president of one of his industry’s trade groups. “It’s a target-rich environment at the moment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/los-angeles-immigration-us-marshal-injured","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:43:00Z","title":"US Marshal and Undocumented Immigrant Injured in Shooting During ICE Stop in Los Angeles","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 22, 2025, during an immigration enforcement operation in South Los Angeles, a 44-year-old Mexican national, Carlitos Ricardo Parias—a popular TikTok streamer known as Richard LA—was injured when an ICE agent discharged a weapon during a confrontation.

to rookie passer Jaxson Dart who replaced Wilson as the Giants’ starter after the team began the season 0-3.\n \n\n   \n  “I was talking to John Mara not too long ago and I said: ‘We were hoping that

seasons, failing to make the playoffs in either of them.\n \n\n   \n  Despite throwing for over 3,000 yards with 26 touchdowns during the 2023 season, Wilson was benched after the first 15 games and

contract that assured him $37 million if he could not pass a physical on the fifth day of the new league year in March 2024.\n \n\n   \n  By benching Wilson, Denver made sure that he couldn’t get injured and was consequently able to save money on his release.\n \n\n   \n   Speaking to reporters  at the time, Wilson said he was approached by the team after the Broncos’ Week 8 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and told if he didn’t move back his injury guarantee in his contract that he’d be benched.\n \n\n   \n  “We beat the Chiefs.

that  WNBA  players will get “a big increase” in pay from the league’s new collective bargaining agreement (CBA).\n \n\n   \n   Speaking  on NBC’s “Today” show on Tuesday before the start of the new NBA season, Silver was asked whether players in the WNBA should be receiving a larger share of the league’s revenue.\n \n\n   \n  He initially responded “Yes,” then clarified: “I think ‘share’ isn’t the right way to look at it because there’s so much more revenue in the NBA. I think you should look at it in absolute numbers in terms of what they’re making.\n \n\n   \n  “And they are going to get a big increase in this cycle of collective bargaining, and they deserve it.”\n \n\n   \n  WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has previously said that a new deal will get done between the league and its players, though not necessarily by the October 31 deadline.\n \n\n   \n  Under the  current CBA , players currently get 9.3% of the WNBA’s total revenue, while NBA players receive 49%.\n \n\n   \n  The WNBA has enjoyed  huge growth  in recent seasons, with the 13 franchises increasing in value by an average of 180%, according to research by Sportico released earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Sportico said that TV ratings, merchandise sales, attendance and revenue increases over the last 12 months have led to the league exploding in value, with  Caitlin Clark ’s Indiana Fever growing by 273% to a $335 million valuation.\n \n\n   \n  In the  past season , the WNBA’s salary cap was set at $1,507,100, with a maximum of $249,244 and minimum of $66,079.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s comments appeared to anger the WNBPA, the league’s players’ association, which shared the video of Silver in a post on  Instagram Stories  and commented: “Don’t you want to share, @adamsilvernba?”\n \n\n   \n  WNBA players have long been protesting against the league’s pay, with those competing in this year’s All-Star game  warming up in T-shirts  with the words “Pay Us What You Owe Us.”\n \n\n   \n  The tension between the players and the league’s leadership reached new heights last month when Minnesota Lynx star  Napheesa Collier said  that the WNBA has “the worst leadership in the world” and displayed a “lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  Engelbert  responded  by saying that she has “utmost respect” for Collier and has been “work(ing) tirelessly to transform this league.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/medicaid-work-requirement-apps","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Officials show little proof that new tech will help Medicaid enrollees meet work rules","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a major policy shift in the U.S. Medicaid program under the Trump administration’s tax and spending law, which introduces work requirements—such as working, studying, or volunteering at least 80 hours per month—for enrollees.

They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona.  Mehmet Oz , director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz,  during a television appearance  in August.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a  recent radio appearance  that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs  began under the Biden administration .\n \n\n   \n  And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said  Joan Alker , a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.\n \n\n   \n  “What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  The  Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona , a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.\n \n\n   \n  State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”\n \n\n   \n  One person  doing that development  is Michael Burstein, a software engineer who, until recently, worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called  Digital Public Works  to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”\n \n\n   \n  The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems,  many of which need updating , which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals  roughly four times what it cost  to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.\n \n\n   \n  That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a  temporary extension , despite a  recent report  from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A  complicated sign-up process  has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also allows counties with  high unemployment rates to be exempted , but states must apply for that exemption.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an app that states can use to prove people are eligible for Medicaid, enrollees would still need to know that app existed and how to use it — neither of which is a given, Alker said. There is also no guarantee they’d have reliable cell service or internet access. As  KFF Health News has reported , millions of Americans live in rural areas without reliable internet.\n \n\n   \n  Private vendors also have been working on such apps, said  Jennifer Wagner , who researches Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Wagner said she has seen several vendors demonstrate products they plan to pitch to states for the work rules. Many are limited in scope, she said, like those in the pilot tests.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody has a magical solution that’ll make sure eligible people don’t lose coverage,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/simplified-investment-strategy-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"The benefits of keeping your investing life simple","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes the KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart) investment strategy, arguing that most actively managed funds fail to outperform low-cost index funds over time.

Because, it turns out, “It’s extremely difficult to beat the market,” said Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, data from Morningstar suggest most actively managed funds don’t.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers compared their performance after fees to a composite of passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds.\n \n\n   \n  “Just 21% of active strategies survived and beat their passive counterparts over the 10 years through June 2025,” they wrote in a  mid-year report  about Morningstar’s Active/Passive Barometer.\n \n\n   \n  As just one example of how actively managed funds may disappoint, Morningstar found that over 20 years, only 7.1% of large cap blend funds – which invest in both growth and value stocks and might compare their performance to the S&P 500 – performed better than index funds in the same category.\n \n\n   \n    Picking the right fund(s) for you\n \n\n   \n  If the bulk of your money is in a workplace retirement plan like a 401(k), chances are you will have the option to invest in a  target-date retirement fund .\n \n\n   \n  Such a fund allocates your money across other stock and bond funds – often index funds – to achieve an allocation that best suits your time horizon to retirement. So for someone who’s 40 they might be in a 2050 or 2055 target date fund.\n \n\n   \n  The fund’s allocation will grow more conservative (less in stocks, more in bonds) as you near your expected retirement year.\n \n\n   \n  “A target date fund can be a great option. It builds in portfolio diversification and an asset mix targeted to your age and retirement date,” Arnott said.\n \n\n   \n  If you don’t have a target date fund, or don’t like the one available in your plan, consider investing instead in three broad index funds and adjust how much you invest in each according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  “The average person probably will get better results with a target-date fund. But if you want a slightly more hands-on approach you could put together a basic portfolio of US and international stocks plus investment-grade bonds. Having exposure to those three asset classes is all you really need,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond retirement, for any investing you’re doing to meet intermediate-term goals with a five- to 10-year horizon, she suggests putting money into a high-quality intermediate-term bond index fund or a low-cost, actively managed one, since this is one arena in which actives have had a reasonably good track record against their benchmarks. Or you might also consider a low-cost, moderate-risk allocation fund of funds – which invests in both stocks and bonds.\n \n\n   \n    The psychological benefits\n \n\n   \n  Just as having fewer but better clothes in an organized closet can reduce your decision fatigue about what to wear, adopting a KISS strategy with just one or a few, low-cost funds can reduce the stress of managing your investments.\n \n\n   \n  With a simple, streamlined portfolio, you’ll know what you’re invested in.\n \n\n   \n  It will be easier to review – which you should do once a year to make sure the way your money is allocated still reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  And your portfolio will be easier to explain to a spouse or adult child, who may help you manage it if you become unable to do so alone, or who will eventually inherit it.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve gotten older and my financial situation has gotten more complicated, I’ve come to appreciate the value of simplicity more,” Arnott said. “There’s a lot of value in having a portfolio that is easier for someone to take over when you’re gone. Or if you’re an  older adult with a cognitive impairment .”\n \n\n   \n  And, perhaps most importantly, having a simpler portfolio may make it easier to assess whether you  need to save  more now. Because no matter how well your investments do, if you aren’t saving sufficiently, the best returns in the world won’t get you where you need to go.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/breast-cancer-invasive-lobular-carcinoma-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:25:00-04:00","title":"What to know about a rapidly rising form of breast cancer that’s hard to detect","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the journal Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, reveals that invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), the second most common type of breast cancer in the U.S., has been rising at more than three times the rate of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade.

How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?\n \n\n   \n  To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.\n \n\n   \n  ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the  National Cancer Institute . About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesn’t change the breast’s structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that don’t show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.\n \n\n   \n  These tests aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.\n \n\n   \n  Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Treatment is similar to that for  other breast cancers . Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age or family history, but many  lifestyle choices  can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.\n \n\n   \n  Regular screening and knowing what’s normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/basketball-nba-okc-rockets-warriors-lakers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"NBA Opening Night: OKC wins double-OT thriller against Rockets as they receive championship rings, Warriors topple Lakers","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NBA season opens with two dramatic games: the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrate their first championship since 2008 by receiving rings and raising a banner, then defeat the Houston Rockets in a tense double-overtime thriller, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leading the charge.

Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  On an evening which began with the celebration of the  Oklahoma City Thunder ’s title victory – with players receiving their championship rings and a banner being raised to the rafters of Paycom Center – fans were treated to two exciting games.\n \n\n   \n  First, the Thunder played a double-overtime thriller against the new-look  Houston Rockets , holding on to win 125-124 in an instant classic. And in California, the LeBron James-less Los Angeles Lakers lost their home opener 119-109 to the Golden State Warriors.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know about the two opening games of the 2025 NBA season.\n \n\n   \n    Thunder celebrate title victory, win double-OT classic\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s title victory was the culmination of years of hard work for the Thunder, whether it be through some savvy drafting or creative trades to acquire key pieces.\n \n\n   \n  Those moves all paid off in the form of a dominant regular season and a playoffs which saw Oklahoma City race past most of its opponents, eventually beating the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals in seven games to secure the franchise’s first title since moving from Seattle in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday’s home opener, the victorious Thunder players from last year were serenaded by their fans while receiving their championship rings from Thunder chairman Clay Bennett.\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s  NBA Most Valuable Player , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, was the last to get his ring, with fans chanting “M-V-P!” as he made his way onto the court.\n \n\n   \n  The players then posed for pictures with their new rings – designed by Jostens and which are set in 14-karat gold with more than 800 custom-cut, hand-set gemstones – while the championship banner was raised.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing the banner up there was cool, knowing it’ll be up there forever,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after Tuesday’s game. “Special night.”\n \n\n   \n  After the celebrations were wrapped up, it was time to begin the defense of their crown. First up was the Rockets who, during the offseason, had asserted their own title aspirations by trading for former Thunder star Kevin Durant from the Phoenix Suns.\n \n\n   \n  Durant, 37,  reportedly signed  a two-year extension worth $90 million with the team on Sunday and the move to acquire the 15-time NBA All-Star hints that the franchise is all-in this season.\n \n\n   \n  The game at Paycom Center was a tight affair, with very little to separate the two teams. With 9.5 seconds of regulation time remaining and with the Rockets leading 103-102, Durant had two free throw attempts to potentially put his new team up by three. However, he missed the first and drained the second to give Houston a two-point lead, only for Gilgeous-Alexander to go up the other end and level the score to send it to OT.\n \n\n   \n  Durant almost had another disastrous moment at the end of the first overtime when, with 1.3 seconds left, he caught the ball and signaled for a timeout even though the Rockets didn’t have any left. This usually comes with a one-shot technical free throw for the opposing team but the  officials admitted afterwards  that they missed Durant’s signal and, with the score tied again, the game went to a second overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Ending an action-packed return to OKC for Durant, he played a part in the Thunder eventually securing the victory.\n \n\n   \n  With the Rockets up one, Durant fouled Gilgeous-Alexander with two seconds left, picking up his sixth personal foul and exiting the game.

22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the government shutdown, with more than 1 million of them  going unpaid  while Democrats and Republicans in Congress argue over funding federal agencies for the current fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  But those lawmakers on Capitol Hill aren’t missing any paychecks during the impasse, which began October 1, with no end in sight. They continue to receive their salaries, as directed by the  Constitution  – although some have said they wouldn’t accept their pay or will donate the money.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically fall unevenly on those who work for the federal government. And this time, President Donald Trump is taking additional steps to shield — at least temporarily — certain employees and the  military  from the financial pain, even as he threatens that hundreds of thousands of other staffers may never receive the  back pay  guaranteed to them under a 2019 law that he signed.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Senate GOP leaders will put to a vote a bill that would  pay certain essential workers  during the shutdown, though Democrats don’t seem inclined to support the measure unless it applies to all federal staffers who aren’t being paid during the impasse. Some GOP lawmakers are also questioning the effort, saying it would remove one of the  main pressure points  that could help end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  With many federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, missing even one can be financially devastating. Scores of federal employees have written to CNN about the economic toll the shutdown is taking on them and their families, leaving them at risk of losing their homes or cars or making it difficult for them to feed and provide for their families.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who gets paid\n \n\n   \n  In addition to lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and federal judges will still receive their paychecks, thanks to the Constitution. So will political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate, along with certain other appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Also, roughly 830,000 federal workers are continuing to be paid during the impasse, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of shutdown contingency plans filed by agencies. That’s because their compensation doesn’t rely on annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, they are paid through other spending packages, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, through fees or through other resources.\n \n\n   \n  Only days before the roughly 2 million active-duty and reserve members of the military were set to  miss their first paychecks , the Trump administration announced it would use about $8 billion in Pentagon research and development funds to cover the October 15 payroll. But there isn’t enough money for the next distribution at the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Trump administration has  moved to pay  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, according to Kash Patel, the agency’s director. Plus, 70,000 law enforcement personnel in the  Department of Homeland Security , including in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Secret Service and other divisions will receive their paychecks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  posted on X. \n \n\n   \n    Here’s who doesn’t get paid\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while another roughly 670,000 have been furloughed, according to the latest estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. However, agencies have made changes as the shutdown drags on. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service originally said it would use the Inflation Reduction Act to keep paying all of its roughly 74,300 employees but a week later decided to  furlough nearly half its workforce .\n \n\n   \n   Senate staffers  learned Friday that they will not receive their October 20 paychecks and won’t be paid for the remainder of the shutdown, while the judicial branch announced that it has run out of funding to sustain full operations. Essential staff will stay on the job, working without pay, while other court employees will be furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, federal workers typically received back pay when impasses ended, but Congress made it official in 2019. However, the White House budget office is considering a new interpretation of that law, arguing it doesn’t cover furloughed employees.\n \n\n   \n  Many  federal contractors , including those who handle security, clean offices and staff the cafes in federal buildings, are also laid off during shutdowns. But unlike federal workers, they have no guarantee of being made whole at the end of the impasse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94586","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:12:00-20:00","title":"Vance slams Israel's parliament vote on West Bank annexation, calling it an 'insult'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Vice President JD Vance condemned Israel's parliamentary vote on West Bank annexation as an 'insult' and reaffirmed the Trump administration's opposition to such moves, emphasizing a desire for a partnership with Israel rather than a vassal relationship.

Speaking on the tarmac of Tel Aviv's international airport before departing Israel, Vance said that if the Knesset vote was a \"political stunt, then it is a very stupid political stunt.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I personally take some insult to it,\" Vance said. \"The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.\" An intense U.S. push toward peace Earlier this week, Vance announced the opening of a civilian military coordination center in southern Israel where some 200 U.S. troops are working alongside the Israeli military and delegations from other countries planning the stabilization and reconstruction of Gaza. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Rubio told journalists at Joint Base Andrews late Wednesday that he plans to visit the center and appoint a Foreign Service official to work alongside the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper. The U.S. is seeking support from other allies, especially Gulf Arab nations, to create an international stabilization force to be deployed to Gaza and train a Palestinian force. \"We'd like to see Palestinian police forces in Gaza that are not Hamas and that are going to do a good job, but those still have to be trained and equipped,\" he said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Rubio also criticized efforts by far-right politicians in the Israeli parliament who on Wednesday took the symbolic step of giving preliminary approval to a bill that would give Israel authority to annex the occupied West Bank — a move the U.S. opposes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump \"has made clear that's not something we'd be supportive of right now, and we think it's potentially threatening to the peace deal,\" he said. The bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether the bill has support to win a majority in the 120-seat parliament, and Netanyahu has tools to delay or defeat it. Vance visits Holy Sepulcher Meanwhile, Vance visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the sprawling 12th century basilica where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, died and rose again, in Jerusalem's Old City. He is then expected to meet Israel's Defense Minister, Israeli military leaders and other officials at the army's headquarters in Tel Aviv. On Wednesday, Vance sought to ease concerns that the Trump administration was dictating terms to its closest ally in the Middle East. \"We don't want in Israel a vassal state, and that's not what Israel is. We want a partnership, we want an ally,\" Vance said, speaking beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in response to a reporter's question about whether Israel was becoming a \"protectorate\" of the U.S. Netanyahu, who will meet with Rubio as well, expressed similar sentiments while acknowledging differences of opinion as they push forward the U.S.-proposed ceasefire agreement. Israeli media referred to the nonstop parade of American officials visiting to ensure Israel holds up its side of the fragile ceasefire as \"Bibi-sitting.\" The term, utilizing Netanyahu's nickname of Bibi, refers to an old campaign ad when Netanyahu positioned himself as the \"Bibi-sitter\" whom voters could trust with their kids. Palestinians in Gaza in dire need of medical care In the first medical evacuation since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, the head of the World Health Organization said Thursday they had evacuated 41 critical patients and 145 companions out of the Gaza strip. In a statement posted to X, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on nations to show solidarity and help some 15,000 patients who are still waiting for approval to receive medical care outside Gaza. His calls were echoed by an official with the U.N. Population Fund who, on Wednesday, described the \"sheer devastation\" that he witnessed on his most recent travel to Gaza, saying that there is no such thing as a \"normal birth in Gaza now.\" Andrew Saberton, an executive director at UNFPA, told reporters how difficult the agency's work has become due to the lack of functioning or even standing health care facilities. \"I was not fully prepared for what I saw. One can't be. The sheer extent of the devastation looked like the set of a dystopian film. Unfortunately, it is not fiction,\" he said. Saberton added that Palestinian women cannot get access to a hospital. \"They often don't even have access to a private space in a tent. We have stories of women giving birth actually in the rubble, beside the road,\" he said. Court hearing on journalists' access to Gaza Separately on Thursday, Israel's Supreme Court held a hearing into whether to open the Gaza Strip to the international media and gave the state 30 days to present a new position in light of the new situation under the ceasefire. Israel has blocked reporters from entering Gaza since the war erupted on Oct 7, 2023. The Foreign Press Association, which represents dozens of international news organizations including The Associated Press, had asked the court to order the government to open the border. In a statement after Thursday's decision, the FPA expressed its \"disappointment\" and called the Israeli government's position to deny journalists access \"unacceptable.\" The court rejected a request from the FPA early in the war, due to objections by the government on security grounds. The group filed a second request for access in September 2024. The government has repeatedly delayed the case. Palestinian journalists have covered the two-year war for international media. But like all Palestinians, they have been subject to tough restrictions on movement and shortages of food, repeatedly displaced and operated under great danger. Some 200 Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israeli fire, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. \"It is time for Israel to lift the closure and let us do our work alongside our Palestinian colleagues,\" said Tania Kraemer, chairperson of the FPA. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-week-7-takeaways-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"04:51:00-04:51","title":"Second-year QBs ascending to stardom, Colts duo on historic pace, is Chiefs offense back to its best?

stardom, Colts duo on historic pace, is Chiefs offense back to its best? NFL Week 7 takeaways \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:51 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Outside of arguably the wildest ending to a regular season game in recent NFL history,  Week 7  had plenty of other talking points.\n \n\n   \n  Whether it be the Philadelphia Eagles finally getting their offense back on track or the never-ending struggles of the New York Jets, the unusually parity-filled season in the NFL continues to produce storylines.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the three main takeaways from Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Second-year QBs ascending to stardom\n \n\n   \n  Last season saw 2024 No. 2 overall pick  Jayden Daniels  explode as a rookie sensation with the Washington Commanders.\n \n\n   \n  This year though, the two passers picked either side of Daniels in last year’s draft – No. 1 pick Caleb Williams and No. 3 pick Drake Maye – are having their time in the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  After losing the first two games of the  season , Williams and the Chicago Bears have won their last four games under first-year head coach Ben Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  Although Sunday’s 26-14 win over the New Orleans Saints wasn’t a vintage Williams performance – he threw 15-of-26 for 172 passing yards with no touchdowns, one interception and two fumbles – his overall confidence level appears to have improved in Johnson’s offensive system.\n \n\n   \n  The 23-year-old came into the league as the consensus top pick in last year’s draft but struggled as a rookie, in a season which saw the Bears fire their head coach Matt Eberflus following a  disastrous Thanksgiving Day loss .\n \n\n   \n  After a game where everything wasn’t smooth sailing – Chicago had plenty of pre-snap penalties and Williams’ two fumbles came on botched snaps with the center – the young quarterback says these experiences are important if the team are going to continue improving.\n \n\n   \n  “Days like today are needed, just in the sense of it gives you a little bit more to be able to look back on something and figure out what’s important,” Williams told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “You have these moments, and then you get later in the season and you may start to have one of these moments, and you get to go back to the feeling, go back to what was wrong and what you needed to figure out early in the season. So it’s like: ‘Okay, I remember what it was, I remember how I can fix it.’”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Maye is also thriving in New England under a new head coach with the experienced Mike Vrabel now at the helm and long-time playcaller for Tom Brady, Josh McDaniels, installed as offensive coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  Maye and the Patriots are also riding their own four-game winning streak following a 31-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Maye was almost perfect in the win, throwing 21-of-23 for 222 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 62 yards on eight carries.\n \n\n   \n  As the Pats look for the quarterback to fill the sizable void left by the legendary Brady, Maye’s outing on Sunday hinted he might be just that man; his 91.3% completion rate broke Brady’s single-game franchise record of 88.5%, which he set against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s rare you have three potential star quarterbacks in the same draft but Williams and Maye are showing that together with Daniels, they could make the 2024 class one for the ages.\n \n\n   \n    Colts duo on historic pace\n \n\n   \n  No one could’ve predicted how well this Indianapolis Colts season is going.\n \n\n   \n  Quarterback Daniel Jones was coming off being cut by the New York Giants and spending time as a reserve QB for the Minnesota Vikings. Jones won the starting job after an offseason battle with 2024 fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson but expectations were not high.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Colts have been everything and more through seven weeks of the 2025 campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Their 38-24 win over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday saw them hold onto their spot atop the AFC and improve their record to 6-1.\n \n\n   \n  Indy’s proficient offense, led by Jones and running back Jonathan Taylor, has scored 232 points, averaging a league-best 33.1 per game. The 232-point tally is the most scored by a Colts team through seven games since 1964,  per the NFL .\n \n\n   \n   According to NFL researcher John Todd , Jones is the first player to complete two-thirds of his passes and have 200-or-more pass yards in each of his first seven games of a season since at least 1950.\n \n\n   \n  Jones has undoubtedly been helped by Taylor’s excellence; on Sunday, he rushed for 94 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries. It is his third game this year with at least three rushing scores.\n \n\n   \n  In doing so, he became the  fourth player since 1950  to have at least three games of scoring three-plus rushing touchdowns within the first seven games of the season, joining Derrick Henry, Priest Holmes and Jim Brown.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor  leads the NFL  in rushing yards (697) and rushing touchdowns (10) and is second in the league in rushing attempts (131). He led the league in all three categories in the 2021 season and, if he was to do so again this year, he’d be the first player since Brown to achieve the feat more than once.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s the best back in the league right now, there’s no doubt,” Colts head coach Shane Steichen said of Taylor. “He’s running hard, he’s running physical, he’s got great vision. Yeah, he’s just balling out man.”\n \n\n   \n  The Colts are the surprise playoff contenders, but if Jones and Taylor can keep performing at the highest level, who’s to say a deep postseason run couldn’t be on the cards?\n \n\n   \n    Is the Chiefs offense back to its best?\n \n\n   \n  When Patrick Mahomes exploded onto the scene with the Kansas City Chiefs, he had a revolutionary effect on how offenses operate in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  But as defenses have found ways to slow him down and some of the Kansas City QB’s key contributors have moved on or gotten older, the Chiefs offense has transitioned into more of a dink-and-dunk operation.\n \n\n   \n  That is until this year.\n \n\n   \n  After a slow opening two weeks, the explosive plays are back for Mahomes and the Chiefs, culminating in their 31-0 domination of the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas City has now scored over 30 points in its past four games – in contrast, they had scored 30 points or more six times over the past two seasons combined – and, following the return of receiver Rashee Rice from his  six-game suspension , boasts a plethora of offensive weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Rice was playing at an All-Pro level last year before suffering a torn ACL, second-year receiver Xavier Worthy is always improving and even tight end Travis Kelce is appearing more sprightly than last campaign.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Mahomes threw three touchdown passes – two to the returning Rice and one to Marquise Brown – while Isiah Pacheco ran for another. It was the 28th game of Mahomes’ career where he’s had at least three TD passes and no interceptions, surpassing Russell Wilson for the most such games by a quarterback in their first nine seasons in NFL history.\n \n\n   \n  It was also the 93 rd  regular season victory of his career, passing Peyton Manning for the most regular-season wins ever by a player under the age of 31.\n \n\n   \n  After Sunday’s dominant victory over the Raiders, head coach Andy Reid highlighted the impact of having Rice back on the field to help the offense.\n \n\n   \n  “He did a great job. I was a little cautious with him on how many plays and all that. I thought he came out and functioned at a high level for being gone for all this time,” Reid told reporters. “It’s crazy that he can come back and do what he did and do it at the level that he did it at.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll gradually build him up. We’ll get his reps up here a little bit as we go. You got to be careful with that when somebody’s been off for a while. I thought all of them together did some really good things. … There’s a lot of things happening there that are positive.”\n \n\n   \n  Even though the Chiefs’ 4-3 record is some way off the top of the AFC at the moment – the Colts lead the conference with a 6-1 record with the Patriots and Denver Broncos sitting at 5-2 – this revival in offensive production has put the rest of the league on notice.

\n         By Becky Sullivan \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 1:54 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones were arrested Thursday over their alleged participation in two major illegal gambling schemes — one involving bets placed on NBA games, the other involving underground poker games — investigated  by the FBI . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Federal prosecutors say the two schemes were organized in part by New York crime families and involved hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal, fraudulent wagers. More than 30 people were arrested in eleven states on Thursday, and more are expected to surrender themselves later, Justice Department officials said. \"This is an illegal gambling operation and sports-rigging operation that spanned the course of years,\" said  FBI director Kash Patel  at a Thursday press conference. \"The fraud is mind-boggling. It's not hundreds of dollars. It's not thousands of dollars. It's not even millions of dollars. We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation.\" One indictment —  United States vs. Earnest, et al.  — involved a scheme to place bets on NBA games based on non-public information, such as when a player planned to pull himself out of a game due to injury or illness. Working with organized crime groups, NBA \"insiders\" such as Rozier and Jones would pass along confidential information in exchange for some of the proceeds, said Joseph Nocella, the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. \"They relied on corrupt individuals, including Jones and Rozier. They also used misused information obtained during long-standing friendships they had with NBA players and coaches,\" he said. The indictment highlights seven games in 2023 and 2024 on which hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of illegal bets were allegedly placed. Insider tips came to gamblers from connections on five teams, including two then-active players: Rozier, who at the time played for the Charlotte Hornets, and Jontay Porter, then a player with the Toronto Raptors who was  banned for life  from the NBA last year due to his involvement in gambling.  Other tips came from Jones, the former Cavaliers player and coach who was serving as an \"unofficial\" assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers during the spring of 2023, the indictment says. Jones allegedly sold or attempted to sell non-public information about player injuries to gamblers.   Other insiders, including a Trail Blazers coach and an Orlando Magic player, allegedly provided information to gamblers but were not named in the indictment. The second indictment, called  United States vs. Aiello , involved a series of rigged poker games arranged by organized crime groups in New York. Victims were induced to participate in the games with the promise of playing against prominent former athletes, including Billups and Jones, Nocella said. Then, using a variety of cheating technology — including rigged shuffling machines and an x-ray poker table designed to reveal the victims' hidden cards — the crime groups would cheat the victims out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game, the indictment alleges. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Victims lost at least $7 million in the rigged games, officials say. Other defendants include the games' organizers, suppliers of the cheating equipment and others who allegedly played in the rigged games — including Billups, who participated in a series of games in 2019 in Las Vegas, according to the indictment.  Billups and Rozier each face one count of wire fraud conspiracy and one count of money laundering conspiracy. Jones, who allegedly participated in both schemes, faces two counts of each charge. Billups, 49, played in the NBA for 17 years, winning a title with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. He was  named coach  of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2021 and was elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame last year. Jones, also 49, played for ten different teams over the course of his NBA career from 1998 through 2009, including three seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Billups and Rozier, 31, are expected to appear in federal court later Thursday, Billups in Portland and Rozier in Orlando. They will be arraigned in New York at a future date, said DOJ spokesperson John Marzulli. James Trusty, a lawyer representing Rozier, told NPR in a statement that the player's arrest on Thursday had come as a surprise, as prosecutors had previously communicated to them that Rozier was \"a subject, not a target\" of their investigation. \"It is unfortunate that instead of allowing him to self surrender they opted for a photo op. They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case,\" Trusty said. \"Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2023, when Rozier played for the Charlotte Hornets, the NBA was alerted to \"unusual betting activity\" related to his performance in a March game against the New Orleans Pelicans, the NBA said  in a statement earlier this year . Rozier logged five points, four rebounds and two assists in the first quarter of that game before exiting with what the team described as \"foot discomfort.\" All those totals were well below his season averages, and all of them were under the betting lines set by sportsbooks for proposition wagers. Rozier did not play again that season. He was later traded to the Miami Heat. At the time, the NBA conducted an investigation and did not find any wrongdoing, the league said this year. Meanwhile, the federal investigation had proceeded separately. In the unsealed indictment, Rozier is accused of telling a friend, Deniro Laster, ahead of time that he planned to exit the game early so that Laster could place a bet on the game. Laster then sold that information to other gamblers for $100,000, the indictment alleges, leading to more than a quarter-million dollars worth of bets being placed on the \"under\" in proposition bets involving Rozier's performance. Federal officials said Thursday that the NBA had cooperated with the investigation. In  a statement , the NBA said the league \"will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities\" and that Billups and Rozier had been placed on leave. \"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains a top priority,\" the statement said. Neither the Trail Blazers nor the Heat has responded to NPR's requests for comment. It was not immediately clear who was representing Billups or Jones in the cases.  Prosecutors said another former NBA player, Jontay Porter, had been involved in the organized gambling operation. Porter was banned for life by the NBA in 2024 after an investigation revealed he had manipulated his performances for the Toronto Raptors in two games that year. Later that year, he pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the scheme. Porter is set to be sentenced in December. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5538090","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00-04:00","title":"It's the deadliest year for ICE in decades.

As detentions rise, the trend may continue \n         By Ximena Bustillo, Rahul Mukherjee \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 10:22 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Immigration and Customs Enforcement has recorded its deadliest year since the early 2000s as agency officials push to increase the number of people in its custody. According to a review of deaths by NPR, at least 20 people have died in ICE custody so far this year. The number comes as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years.  Deaths reached a peak in 2025 for the first time since 32 deaths were recorded in 2004, and 20 deaths were recorded in 2005. Former agency officials are warning that increased detention population, decreased oversight, an increase in street and community arrests and continued difficulties staffing medical teams will result in more deaths. This summer, ICE received about $70 billion to hire more staff, including deportation and detention officers, and increase its detention space. Across the country, media and immigration advocates have reported  overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food  and health care access — a byproduct of a rapid scaling-up of immigration arrests. \"Can staffing actually keep pace with the increase in population? And that becomes particularly challenging in more remote locations where it was already difficult to find qualified staff willing to come out and work,\" said Peter Mina, who worked at ICE for nearly a decade including most recently as the deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. \"And that just places risk all across the system, including, unfortunately, individuals in detention facing medical conditions that might result in their death.\" ICE did not respond to an immediate request for comment on the count. Mina's former office at DHS was among those that would conduct investigations following a detainee death. Additional investigations were conducted by the ICE Health Services Corps and the Immigration Office of Detention Oversight. CRCL was among the oversight offices at  the department that saw hundreds of staff cuts earlier this year . Other CRCL employees have previously told NPR that the gutting of their office  could result in more deaths in custody . During the ongoing government shutdown, DHS has confirmed, the Office of Detention Oversight is not working. So far this month, two more detainees have died in custody. Medical conditions surrounding deaths over the last calendar year have included  tuberculosis ,  strokes ,  respiratory failure  and about  three  possible  suicides . Each preliminary report includes a synopsis of the detainees' immigration and criminal histories, as they have for past administrations, as well as the events leading to the time of death. One reason for the rise in deaths, former employees said, is that there are just simply more people in detention. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"With that kind of spike in population, there's going to be a need for additional staffing both on the medical and mental health side, as well as even from an officer standpoint,\" Mina said. The types of arrests being made by federal immigration officers this year are different, too. Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who worked under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said that previously most of the agency's detainees either came from the border or from local law enforcement custody. In these cases, she said, those coming from the border tended to be younger and healthier; or health care records were generally established for those who had been previously detained in prisons or jails. \"Whereas when you pick somebody up on the street, it's a lot of unknowns. Do they have chronic medical conditions they're not even aware of? Do they have addiction issues?\" McNulty said. \"The systems and triaging and maybe even the resources to really appropriately care for people when taking in such a varied population probably should increase.\" Since the early months of the administration,  officials have touted  focusing their arrests in the \"interior\" of the country, as numbers of crossings at the  southern border have steadily decreased . DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement that detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. \"With all these healthcare services and access to medical care ICE provides illegal aliens in detention, it should come as no surprise to the media that as we expand detention space, we need to hire more medical professionals,\" McLaughlin said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But both Mina and McNulty said that hiring medical staff at immigration detention facilities has long been a challenge for the agency. According to a review of detainee deaths since 2004, three detention facilities have held the most deaths: Eloy Federal Contract facility just outside Phoenix; Krome Services Processing Center in Florida; and Stewart Detention Center in Georgia. A  2021 DHS Office of Inspector General  report identified \"remote locations, a cumbersome hiring process, and competing opportunities\" among the challenges to retaining and recruiting medical staff. The Eloy and Stewart facilities were specifically mentioned as among those experiencing these difficulties. DHS has begun a process to hire more medical professionals including nurses and pharmacists as it expands its hiring across ICE, including deportation officers and detention personnel. \"ICE is actively recruiting healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, pharmacists, and health administrators, to support the expanded detention capacity enabled by the historic funding provided under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill,\" McLaughlin told NPR in a statement. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Just like with the general population, unfortunately, people will die over a period of time for any series of medical ailments,\" Mina, former deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at ICE, said. \"But the real question is: In a given case, were there circumstances or actions taken or not taken that suggest that that death may have been preventable?\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting musical performances on NPR's Tiny Desk series, which is known for showcasing artists in a simple, intimate setting.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Music","Performance","Intimate Concerts"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582787","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Antidepressant side effects differ greatly depending on the drug, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A large-scale analysis by researchers at King's College London, published in the Lancet, evaluates the physical side effects of 30 antidepressants using data from over 58,000 patients across 150 clinical trials.

finds \n         By Will Stone \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Doctors have long known that antidepressants come with side effects for cardiovascular and metabolic health. But a major analysis from a team of researchers in the U.K. has, for the first time, pulled together data from more than 150 clinical trials to compare the physical side effects of dozens of antidepressants. The study,  published in  the Lancet   this week, details how each medication can affect weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol and other areas of health. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The end result is something akin to a \"sports league table\" for 30 different antidepressants based on their side effect profile, says lead author  Dr. Toby Pillinger , a psychiatrist at King's College London. \"It's never been done at this scale before and no one's ever put specific numbers to the amount of weight you'll put on, or to the amount that your cholesterol goes up,\" he says. The findings are based on existing data, mostly from 8-week drug studies, that altogether represent more than 58,000 patients. The most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the U.S. —  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or  SSRIs, like Zoloft and Prozac  — tended to have fewer physical side effects, according to the analysis. Other medications, particularly some of the older drugs, were shown to have more significant impacts. For example, a person who took nortriptyline,  a tricyclic antidepressant , could, on average, have an increase in heart rate that was 20 beats higher than the SSRI fluvoxamine. For other medications, the expected weight change could be 4 pounds gained, or lost. Pillinger says the intention is not to single out certain antidepressants as better than others. \"It may be that one medication which is pretty bad for one person actually is pretty good for another one. I think that is the message, rather than naming and shaming certain drugs,\" he says. Pillinger hopes the data can help prescribers and their patients make individualized decisions about the best medication. In fact, he and his colleagues have created  a free digital tool  that's already being used by clinicians all over the world to create a \"menu\" of options, based on a patient's underlying health and what side effects they'd most like to avoid. Dr. Nina Kraguljac , a professor at the Ohio State University, who was not involved in the research, says the study was well-done — and largely reassuring. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What surprised me about this study is that side effects are not that severe,\" says Kraguljac, who is also chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Research. However, she stresses that \"side effects alone should not guide a clinical decision,\" since the study's results ultimately reflect an average, not the individual patient. \"Side effects do not happen in every patient and are not necessarily a reason to deter people from taking the medications,\" she says. The study does have some notable limitations. Even though many people take these drugs for months or years, the data was largely from 8-week randomized controlled trials, which are the most common. And some prominent side effects — that cause some people to stop taking antidepressants — were not evaluated, says  Dr. David Hellerstein , a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. He points out the impact on sexual function, gastrointestinal issues and \"emotional blunting\" — a sense that feelings are being muted — are all common complaints that weren't looked at. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most of the side effects detailed in the study are already well-known, although he believes the work will still be \"a useful touchstone\" for patients and prescribers. \"Big picture, most of these drugs seem quite safe on a lot of physical parameters, especially the newer drugs, like the SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors),\" he says. But for some groups of people, the side effects might be significant, he cautions, \"and could affect what medicine the doctor would choose or what medicine a patient would prefer.\" And, he notes, side effects aren't always a downside. Hellerstein has a patient who had lost a significant amount of weight due to depression, meaning an antidepressant that also led to some extra weight would actually be \"healthy.\" \"I would say that is not a side effect. That is a benefit of treatment,\" he says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5501530","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:53:00-04:00","title":"Why does my toddler … ?

The other day, my son started the morning with an explosion of cuddles, followed immediately by refusing the blueberry muffins he had declared his  very favorite  the week before. Once we made it through breakfast, the daily Battle of Putting on Shoes was still ahead! \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sometimes, I feel like I'm playing a game of emotional ping pong with my kid. And that can be hard for both me and him to manage. Fast-changing feelings and defiant behavior are developmentally appropriate for one to three year olds, says pediatric psychologist  Roger Harrison . They're a way of building your kid's sense of self — and understanding their place in the world. But for parents, they can often be a source of frustration, he says. When tantrums and power struggles arise from those emotions, it can be easy for us adults to lose our patience.  Reframing your toddler's boundary-pushing as a means of social and emotional learning might offer some relief, says Harrison, a division chief within the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"When we understand the 'why' of certain behaviors and place them within an appropriate developmental context, it allows parents to step back from the emotion and address the behavior strategically,\" he says. Harrison and other child development experts answer questions about common toddler behaviors — and offer advice on how to respond in the situation. Why does my toddler … say \"NO!\" to   everything, even to things they like?  A toddler's contrarian nature is just par for the course at this stage of development, says Harrison. In addition to developing more language and cognitive and motor skills at lightning speed, they're just beginning to understand that they are their own unique person separate from their caregivers. With this new awareness comes a need to test boundaries in order to establish independence. \"Part of that process of  figuring out who I am is to learn  me  in opposition to all the things in the world,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So if your toddler gives you a resounding \"NO!\" to his favorite popsicle or book before bedtime, what he might be actually doing is trying to flex his newly discovered self-awareness. His \"no\" could translate to, \"Check this out, Mommy! I'm a person with my own mind and opinions now!\" ⭐  Parent tip:   What should you do if you need your child to say \"yes\" to, say, brushing their teeth, getting in their car seat or leaving the playground? Model a calm response, then kindly but firmly let them know what's going to happen next, says  Jamie Glowacki , a parenting and potty training coach and the   author of  Oh Crap! I Have a Toddler . You might say:  Yes, we do need to leave the playground. You can either go down the slide one more time and walk out with me, or I can carry you out right now.   Why does my toddler … say everything is \"mine\"? In Toddlerland, \"the rules of ownership are different,\" Harrison says. \"If it's mine, it's  mine . If it's yours and  I  want it, it's also mine.\" As a child starts to build their identity and independence, they'll often try to exert control over their environment through possession, Harrison says. It helps them understand themselves and their attachments in the world. For example: my mom has black hair, so I have black hair. My sister has a cool toy, so I have a cool toy.  I am a kid with black hair and a cool toy! Mine, mine, mine!   By making claims like these, a toddler can test the boundaries of their environment to better define who they are. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So if your toddler claims every book in the library is hers or refuses to share even her  least  favorite stuffie on her playdate — don't stress, says Harrison. She's not being selfish, she's just stretching out that newfound sense of self.  ⭐  Parent tip:  If you want your kid to share, model then practice the behavior, says early childhood educator  Chazz Lewis . For example, in the aftermath of a toy dispute with another child on the playground, teach your toddler to ask for a turn by reaching your palm out assertively and saying, \"turn, please,\" he says. Do a few practice rounds before sending them back out to play.  Why does my toddler … want to lick/smash/crash into everything? Does your little one love to spill every container they can get their hands on, lick colorful wallpaper or bounce against your living room like it's a life-size pinball machine? They may simply be trying to gain some sensory information about their surroundings, says  Layne Deyling Cherland , a longtime preschool teacher-turned-content creator who focuses on adult-toddler dynamics. To them, every action and interaction is a chance to gather more data about themselves and how things work. \"What's me and what's not me? What effect do I have on the world? That's what all this experimenting is,\" says Deyling Cherland. They may also be craving proprioceptive input, like the deep pressure gained from tight hugs or the strength-building from climbing on playground equipment, she says.  Toddlers crave these types of sensory experiences in part because it builds up their internal sense of position and movement, which is important for coordination, balance and even self-regulation. ⭐  Parent tip :   As long as she's safe, let your little one explore, says Deyling Cherland. Embracing weirdness or silliness can be an opportunity for connection and a key to disrupting power struggles.  Make an obstacle course with pillows and stuffies to get those zoomies out, then race through it together. Dole out some new or favorite snacks into separate bowls and have your picky eater play a game of blind taste-testing. Why does my toddler … keep doing that thing I told them not to do 100 times? No running in the kitchen! I said, don't run in the kitchen! You have 10 seconds to stop running in the kitchen or you're in big trouble, missy!  If you're repeating yourself a bunch with your toddler, you've likely already lost control of the situation, says Glowacki. From a comprehension standpoint, your average toddler doesn't yet grasp the concept of negation, Lewis says. So when you say  don't  run in the kitchen, what your child is more likely to understand from that sentence is:  run  in the kitchen. More importantly, simply telling a kid what you  don't  want them to do doesn't give them any tools for how to behave successfully in the future, he says. ⭐  Parent tip:  Instead of telling your toddler what they're doing  wrong , teach them how to solve the problem or what they should do instead, says Lewis. If you want your kid to stop running in the kitchen, you might say, \"walk slowly in the kitchen.\" Or maybe, \"please walk slowly and gently on the tile floor so you don't hurt yourself.\" \"Now, there's a chance they might actually do something different this time,\" Lewis says. Why does my toddler … hate switching activities? Wake up! Change clothes! Eat breakfast!   Toddlers are bossed around all day long, often with little understanding and even less say in their daily schedule. While toddlers thrive on routine and consistency, transitioning from one task to another can be frustrating, Glowacki says. The break in continuity can be unsettling, especially when they're immersed in an activity that gives them a sense of comfort and independence, like playtime or bath time. Those moments are also one of the very few pieces of the world she can exert any agency over, so that loss of control can feel acute. Add to that hunger, sleepiness, overstimulation — daily factors that would stress out any other human — and those transition periods can become triggers for volatile emotions and tantrums, she says. ⭐  Parent tip:    The next time your little one throws a fit about transitioning from playtime to dinnertime, try to remember that the change is huge for her, says Glowacki. Put a little power back into her hands by offering two positive choices, Lewis says. For example: Blue plate or purple plate? Juice or milk? This gives her agency but allows you to safely steer her where she needs to go.  \"The goal of toddlerhood is to give a child manageable pieces of personal power to practice with,\" Deyling Cherland says. \"We want them to have practiced enough so that when they are this young adult going out into the world, they know, 'This is how I make decisions. My decisions do affect other people.' \" The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib, with art direction by Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

rather die' than use generative AI \n         By Terry Gross \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 1:31 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Oscar-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro was a child in Mexico the first time he watched the 1931 movie  Frankenstein.  He describes the iconic scene where the monster first lurches into the doorway as nothing short of \"an epiphany.\"   \"I saw the resurrection of the flesh, the immaculate conception, ecstasy, stigmata. Everything made sense,\" del Toro says. \"I understood my faith or my dogmas better through  Frankenstein  than through Sunday mass.\"  It was then, at age 7, that del Toro decided the creature of  Frankenstein  would be \"my personal avatar and my personal messiah,\" he says.  Del Toro's film credits include  Pan's Labyrinth , Nightmare Alley  and  The Shape of Water,  which won four Oscars, including best picture and best director. Now, with  Frankenstein , he reimagines Mary Shelley's 1818 classic, telling the final part of the story from the creature's point of view. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of the film's themes echo ideas del Toro's explored throughout his career, including misunderstood creatures, men who behave like monsters and science experiments gone awry. A self-described \"groupie for death,\" del Toro's also interested in the allure — and the torment — of everlasting life. \"I'm a huge fan of death. ... I think it's the metronome of our existence,\" he says. \"Without rhythm, there is no melody, you know? It is the metronome of death that makes us value the compass of the beautiful music.\" Interview highlights On designing a creature that looked nothing like the original Frankenstein \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It has a very Byronian, very doomed, very  Wuthering Heights  sort of look of a doomed hero. And when he's first born, and is bald and almost naked, I wanted it to feel like an anatomical chart, like something newly minted. ... The head is patterned after phrenology manuals from the 1800s. So they have very elegant, almost aerodynamic lines. I wanted this alabaster or marble, statue feel, so it feels like a newly minted human being. And we also tried to make it the way I remember the Jesus images, life size, in the churches of my childhood. On getting over his fear of death when he was younger As a young man, my grandmother and I had a very precarious sense of death and life. My grandmother would say good night to me every day and say, \"Let us pray that I'm here tomorrow.\" And that is pretty intense for a 4 or 5 year old to hear. Sometimes I would sleep at the foot of her bed and I would be listening in the dark for her breathing. And if the breathing ceased, even for two seconds, I would be jolted and take a look to see if she was OK. And that stayed with me for many decades.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I don't fear that anymore. I feel losing people, yes, but me, I'm not afraid of dying. … Right when the lights flutter and you are no longer a director or a general or a pope — right when you become just you and and the lights are flickering out that's when you realize what you did or didn't do in your life and that's the most momentous thing anyone can experience and you can go with great agitation or great peace. On how his life changed after his father won the lottery in 1969 when he was 5 We moved into a house and lived a very sort of strange life. I mean, we had all sorts of pets. We had eagles, a pet lion, 30 dogs, deer. … We had a zoo. Like Danny in  The Shining , I could go on my tricycle for hours in the long corridors sometimes, like a magic realism novel. I would go for weeks without seeing a single adult. I would find food on the fridge, I would find clean clothes on my drawers, and I didn't interact with many adults. I was existing in a mysterious life in an enchanted castle. … One of the things [my father] did is he bought a library and filled it with books that he never read, but I read them all. And that's where I read the encyclopedia of anatomy and health, and that's where I read all the classics,  Moby Dick, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn , Edgar Allan [Poe], Oscar Wilde. On generative AI My concern is not artificial intelligence, but natural stupidity. I think that's what drives most of the world's worst features. But I did want it to have the arrogance of Victor [Frankenstein] be similar in some ways to the tech bros. He's kind of blind, creating something without considering the consequences and I think we have to take a pause and consider where we're going. ... AI, particularly generative AI — I am not interested, nor will I ever be interested. I'm 61, and I hope to be able to remain uninterested in using it at all until I croak. ... The other day, somebody wrote me an email, said, \"What is your stance on AI?\" And my answer was very short. I said, \"I'd rather die.\"  On the current  ICE crackdowns  in LA I have a wallet the size of a leather portfolio and I always carry my papers. I have been stopped in the past and asked to show my papers in the past, and asked pointed questions in the past, pulled aside in immigration in the past. So I have all my papers with me at all times and it is a very difficult time when there is no voice for the other. And I think that understanding that the other is you is crucial.

It was a bright object of some sort. \"It [didn't] look like a rock,\" he recalls. \"It [was] very unusual.\" Once he got closer, Tsogtbaatar — who now works at North Carolina State University — knew exactly what it was. A dome-shaped skull. It turned out that Tsogtbaatar had just discovered a new species of pachycephalosaur, a unique group of dinosaurs defined by their thick, bony, hemispherical skulls but about which little else is known. In that moment, \"we just stopped breathing,\" he says. \"This is the first definitive pachycephalosaur that's ever been found in the early Cretaceous,\" says  Lindsay Zanno , also a paleontologist at North Carolina State University in addition to serving as the head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. \"It just pops out of the fossil record with a fully developed dome, and bells and whistles on its head.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tsogtbaatar, Zanno, and their colleagues have introduced the world to this new species in a paper published in the journal  Nature . They gave it the scientific name  Zavacephale rinpoche .

After its excavation in 2019, the fossil stayed in Mongolia during the pandemic. Finally, in 2022, it was shipped to North Carolina for additional analysis. Zanno says the moment she first laid eyes on it, she was \"enchanted.\" \"Everyone just stood around the lab just holding this precious, incredible skull,\" she says. \"It's just the most beautiful specimen.

So when the team in Mongolia went on to excavate dozens more bones from  Zavacephale rinpoche , it became the most complete pachycephalosaur skeleton ever to be unearthed. \"It's about the size of a German shepherd,\" says Zanno, \"but you have to remember 75% of the body is a neck and a tail, so they're very light. It would have only weighed about 12 pounds.\" A juvenile jewel This little fossil has already revealed a few new insights. The stomach contained small stones that would have helped the animal digest its food. The tail is shot through with bony tendons, which would have made it more rigid. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Plus, this was the first time a pachycephalosaur's hand bones had ever been found. \"At first, we thought it was something it ingested instead of parts of its own body. That's how tiny its hands were,\" says Zanno. In addition, the limb bones allowed the researchers to determine the age of the dinosaur. It was at least two years old, making it a juvenile. This shows that young pachycephalosaurs like this one already had fully developed domes. \"Whether they were battling it out for territory or mates is something we're not entirely sure of,\" says Zanno, \"but what's clear is that whatever they were doing with those domes, they started practicing at a very young age.\" The specimen is now back home at the Institute of Paleontology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences as part of the country's mission to protect its natural and cultural heritage. Cary Woodruff , a curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Frost Museum of Science in Miami who wasn't involved in the study, said he was floored by the discovery — and that his surprise was mixed with a dash of \"very friendly jealousy.\" \"How he even found the specimen is just bonkers,\" Woodruff said of Tsogtbaatar. \"He doesn't just find a new one. He doesn't just find the geologically oldest one. He finds [what] everyone who works on pachycephalosaurs has always wanted to find.\" Evans was similarly impressed. \"I was just stunned by the beauty and completeness of this particular fossil,\" he says. \"This is a specimen that we'll be learning from for many, many years to come.\" Woodruff is also confident that this fossil will spawn new ideas about how pachycephalosaurs once lived. He says usually paleontologists have to work with very incomplete skeletons. \"In our mind, we can see, we can imagine what the rest of it looked like,\" Woodruff says. \"But you didn't have to imagine anything with a specimen like this.

The teeth are literally smiling at you.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST:   The pachycephalosaurs were a unique group of dinosaurs with domed heads, but scientists haven't known much about them because their fossils have been so incomplete until now. Science reporter Ari Daniel describes a stunning discovery from southern Mongolia. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: It was a cloudy morning in June 2019, when paleontologist Chinzorig Tsogtbaatar and several colleagues set out by foot from their campsite to a rocky outcrop dating back about 110 million years to the early Cretaceous. CHINZORIG TSOGTBAATAR: Then after 15 to 20 minutes, I saw something in other side of the hill. DANIEL: A bright object of some sort. TSOGTBAATAR: It wasn't looked like a frog - very unusual. Then I want to go down to check. DANIEL: Once he got closer, Tsogtbaatar, who now works at North Carolina State University, knew exactly what it was. TSOGTBAATAR: It was a skull. DANIEL: And not just any skull. It was dome shaped. Tsogtbaatar had just discovered a new species of pachycephalosaur. TSOGTBAATAR: We just stopped breathing. LINDSAY ZANNO: So this is the first definitive pachycephalosaur that's ever been found in the early Cretaceous. DANIEL: Meaning it's 15 million years older than what had been the oldest pachycephalosaur, says Lindsay Zanno, also a paleontologist at NC State. This specimen fills in a crucial gap in the early evolution of this group of dinos. Zanno remembers the moment she first laid eyes on it. ZANNO: I mean, everyone just stood around the lab just holding this precious, incredible skull. Everyone is enchanted. It's just the most beautiful specimen. DANIEL: That domed head made of solid bone and edged in spikes is any pachycephalosaur's most distinguishing feature. ZANNO: Their domes are essentially indestructible. It would have been able to protect the skull against pressure or impact. And so we think that these animals were battling it out with their heads. DANIEL: Still, researchers have known relatively little about these plant eaters. That's because most of the rest of their bodies haven't been found. So when the team in Mongolia went on to excavate dozens more bones from that new animal, it became the most complete pachycephalosaur skeleton ever to be unearthed. ZANNO: It's about the size of a German shepherd. But you have to remember, 75% of the body is a neck and a tail, so they're very light, at about 12 pounds. DANIEL: This little fossil has already revealed a couple insights. For instance, this was the first time the hand bones of a pachycephalosaur were found, and they were super small. ZANNO: We thought it was something it ingested instead of parts of its own body. That's how tiny its hands were. DANIEL: In addition, the limb bones allowed the researchers to age the dinosaur. It was at least 2 years old, a juvenile, meaning that young pachycephalosaurs like this one already had a fully developed dome. ZANNO: Whether they were battling it out for territory or mates is something we're not entirely sure of, but whatever they were doing with those domes, they started practicing at a very young age. DANIEL: The research is published in the journal Nature. Cary Woodruff is the curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Frost Museum of Science in Miami and wasn't involved in the discovery. He says usually, paleontologists have to work with very incomplete skeletons. CARY WOODRUFF: In our mind, we can see, we can imagine, like, what the rest of it looked like. But you didn't have to imagine anything with a specimen like this. It was there, right? The teeth are literally smiling at you. DANIEL: Woodruff is confident this fossil will spawn new ideas about how pachycephalosaurs once lived.

Cars and trucks and motorcycles rumble everywhere. \"If you look at a car passing by, you see smoke coming out of it — that's illegal in Lebanon. But nobody enforce[s] it,\" says Mokda, the chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington. As a result, Beirut has terrible air quality and is often submerged under a blanket of exhaust. And it's not just in the big cities — vehicles belch pollution across the country. It's one reason that cancer is surging in Lebanon. Mokdad co-authored  a global survey  that revealed that the tiny nation on the Mediterranean is experiencing the fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality anywhere in the world. According to the study, published in  The Lancet , the frequency of new cancer cases in Lebanon has increased by an astounding 162% from 1990 to 2023, with cancer-related deaths increasing by 80% over that same period. In 2023, for every 100,000 people in the country, there were 233.5 new cancer cases. The news is sobering elsewhere too. The survey predicts that cancer cases and cancer deaths will continue to rise worldwide through at least 2050, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Still, Lebanon has reason to be especially alarmed. What's behind the dramatic rise in cancer in Lebanon Mokdad grew up in Lebanon before moving abroad almost 40 years ago. For him, like many here, the disease is personal. \"I'm losing cousins,\" he says. \"I'm scared. I'm losing them at a very young age. It's not only death. It's also diseases. They have so many health problems.\" There are various reasons why cancer is surging in Lebanon. A big one is air pollution from both vehicles and diesel-fueled generators that many homes and businesses use due to unreliable state electricity. In addition, \"we overuse chemicals for our agriculture,\" says Mokdad. Some of these compounds along with sewage ends up in certain rivers. \"People don't drink it but they wash their tabbouleh and their fattoush with it. They're consuming this.\" By far the biggest risk factor, however, is smoking. \"There is no more taboo about smoking,\" Mokdad says. \"Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco.\" It's gotten to the point where Mokdad keeps a set of clothes in Lebanon that he only wears there. There are no public health campaigns warning against the dangers of smoking or secondhand smoke. Instead, Mokdad says  the government  is actually in the business of  buying and selling tobacco . The inevitable result is that lung cancer rates have jumped nationwide. In addition, leukemia and pancreatic and liver cancers have risen. The increases in prostate, colon and breast cancers are all preventable through early screening and detection. The issue, says Mokdad, is that although screening is available, most people don't know to seek it out. \"Health education is a problem,\" he explains. \"If you caught [cancer] earlier,\" people wouldn't have to die. The global survey on cancer and Lebanon's troubling trends with the disease caught the attention of members of the Lebanese parliament. It's why they invited Mokdad to come talk to lawmakers and experts about his findings. Change will be a journey, a slow one at that  Earlier this month, Mokdad traveled to Beirut for the meeting, which was held inside one of the Parliament buildings. After walking through the results of the study and describing the peril that cancer poses, Mokdad suggested to the officials that Lebanon could improve its health screening, ban smoking in public spaces and launch a set of aggressive anti-tobacco ads. By way of example, he pointed to a  public health campaign  launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. a decade ago, one that the CDC and other researchers say prevented  129,100 early deaths  between 2012 and 2018. Inaya Ezzeddine is a member of parliament and a physician who ran the proceedings. She explains that any kind of government response will take time. \"It's a journey,\" she says. \"It's not something that we can implement overnight because it has to do with a lot of sectors. We have to work hard toward this political will.\" A committee will be formed to examine the data and determine which laws will need enacting or strengthening to address the problem. One of the attendees,  Iman Nuwayhid , a professor of public health at the American University of Beirut, believes that individuals should take responsibility too. \"We're accountable to making our country cleaner, reduce pollution, improve the environment,\" he says. \"Of course, the government plays a bigger role, but we have a big responsibility. Local communities again should push in that direction.\" Mokdad argues that the time is now for the government to act and support people in making the right decisions about their health. \"I know Lebanese have to deal with a lot of things,\" he says. \"But cancer is killing. Many people in the parliament said, 'I'm not surprised with this finding.' And my question: What are you doing about it? Why have you been waiting so long to take action?\" A couple blocks from the building where the meeting was held, a mother and son are seated outside, taking a break from work. The mom, 57-year-old, Najah Mourda, is smoking. She says she's recently lost several loved ones to cancer — her mother, her sister and a close friend. \"It's very dangerous and I'm afraid of it,\" she says. Mourda is hopeful that the government will do something, even while acknowledging that she shouldn't be smoking. She knows it's bad for her. She's tried to stop but hasn't been able to kick the habit. Her son, Marwan Bizri, looks on. \"Lebanese people are dying because of cancer,\" he says. \"We're losing people we love.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   A recent global survey predicts cancer cases and cancer deaths will continue to rise through at least 2050, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Lebanon has particular reason to be alarmed. As reporter Ari Daniel reports, the country is experiencing the fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality anywhere in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLE PASSING) ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: I'm in the middle of Beirut, and there are cars and trucks and motorcycles everywhere. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLE PASSING) DANIEL: Beirut has terrible air quality. The capital of Lebanon is often submerged under a blanket of exhaust, and vehicles belch pollution across the country. ALI MOKDAD: If you look at a car passing by, you see smoke coming out of it. That's illegal in Lebanon, but nobody enforce it. DANIEL: Ali Mokdad grew up here but moved abroad almost 40 years ago. He's the chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington and a co-author of a new global cancer survey published in The Lancet. For him, like many in Lebanon, the disease is personal. MOKDAD: I'm losing cousins. I'm scared I'm losing them at a very young age. It's not only deaths. They have so many health problems. DANIEL: There are various reasons why cancer is surging in Lebanon. Air pollution's a big one from vehicles, but also from diesel-fueled generators due to unreliable state electricity. In addition... MOKDAD: We overuse chemicals for our agriculture. And in many places, sewage are dump in the river. And people say, oh, I don't drink it, but they wash their tabbouleh and their fattoush with it. They're consuming this. DANIEL: But by far, the biggest risk factor is smoking. MOKDAD: Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went to some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco. DANIEL: It's gotten to the point where Mokdad keeps a set of clothes in Lebanon he only wears when visiting here. There are no public health campaigns warning against the dangers of smoking or secondhand smoke. So lung cancer has jumped, as has prostate, colon and breast cancers. MOKDAD: These are easy to detect. DANIEL: You mean by screening? MOKDAD: Of course, screening is available, but there is no awareness. Health education is a problem. If you caught it earlier, he or she didn't have to die. DANIEL: Mokdad's report on cancer got the attention of the Lebanese parliament. In particular, they were struck by the finding that the frequency of new cancer cases in Lebanon leaped by 162% and the death rate due to cancer by 80% -  both since 1990. These are the largest jumps anywhere in the world, and that's why Mokdad is here on this day. Lawmakers wanted to hear more about his findings.

DANIEL: After the meeting disperses, Ali Mokdad and I talk outside. He says the government needs to act now. MOKDAD: Cancer is killing. Here is the sad part - many people in the parliament said I'm not surprised with this funding. And my question - what are you doing about it? Why have you been waiting so long to take action? DANIEL: As I'm about to leave, I spot a mother and son seated outside. They're taking a break from work. The mother, Najah Mourda (ph), who's 57, tells me she's recently lost several loved ones to cancer. NAJAH MOURDA: My mom and my friend, my sister - it's very dangerous, and I afraid of it. DANIEL: You want the government to do something? MOURDA: Yes, of course. DANIEL: I look down at Mourda's hand. She's holding a cigarette. She knows it's bad for her. But it's hard to stop. MOURDA: Yes. I try. Really, I try. DANIEL: Mourda's son looks at me. People are dying because of cancer, he says. We're losing people we love. For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel, Beirut, Lebanon.

Copeland, who a decade ago became the  first Black female principal dancer  in the company's 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise. Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like  Swan Lake . \"Misty didn't just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\" In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author — the second volume of her  Bunheads  series appeared in September — and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \" Be Bold ,\" an afterschool program designed for young children of color. But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage — including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades. The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in  Wrecka Stow , by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's  Sinatra Suite  with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo. The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters. On to the next stage Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it's clear an era is ending. \"It's been 25 years at ABT, and I think it's time,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \"It's time for me to move to the next stage.\" She added: \"You know, I've become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying 'thank you' to the company. So it's a farewell. (But) it won't be the end of me dancing. … Never say never.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the carpet Wednesday before her performance, she said: \"I feel good. I feel ready to take this next step.\" She noted that she would be continuing her work promoting diversity: \"There's so much work and effort that has to be continuous.\" Allen told reporters that Copeland had \"helped to redefine the face of ballet. She's inspired millions of people around the world and hopefully, American Ballet Theatre will not wait another 50 years before they have another beautiful Black principal dancer.\" The evening at Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater was streamed live to nearby Alice Tully Hall across the plaza, with attendance free to the public — another sign of Copeland's unique brand of fame in the dance world. Copeland was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in San Pedro, California, where she lived in near poverty and through periods of homelessness as her single mother struggled to support her and five siblings. For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late — at 13 — but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later. In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer. Unlike other promotions, which are announced quietly, Copeland's was announced at a news conference — a testament to her celebrity. Only days before, she'd made a triumphant New York debut in  Swan Lake  in the starring role of Odette/Odile, drawing a diverse and enthusiastic crowd to the Metropolitan Opera House. Trying times for DEI efforts In the AP interview, Copeland acknowledged that it's striking that when she leaves ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's definitely concerning,\" Copeland said. \"I think I've just gotten to a place in my career where there's only so much I can do on a stage. There's only so much that visual representation … can do. I feel like it's the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\" She also noted this is an especially trying moment for anyone working in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion. \"It's a difficult time,\" she said. \"And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. There's no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582442","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Starter Homes Are Scarce.

Despite slowing bidding wars and potential drops in mortgage rates, the supply of such homes remains critically low due to rising construction costs, rising material prices, and restrictive zoning laws. In cities like Austin and Albuquerque, the share of entry-level homes built has declined sharply over the past decade, with Austin's median home price at $560,000 far exceeding the purchasing power of median-income earners. Builders cite lower profit margins and material cost increases (up to 40% since 2020) as key reasons for avoiding affordable housing. Zoning regulations, especially lengthy permitting processes, further delay construction. However, policy responses such as Utah’s $300 million subsidy program and New Mexico’s proposed 'New Homes for New Mexico' initiative — offering $30,000 grants — aim to stimulate development. Meanwhile, homebuyers are encouraged to adopt strategic alternatives, such as relocating to more affordable areas like Bastrop, Texas, or using financial planning tools like those offered by CDFIs to build savings and improve their chances of entry into the market.","keyTakeAways":["The shortage of 'starter homes' — smaller, more affordable homes — is a nationwide issue, making it difficult for

But homebuyers can improve their odds \n         By Scott Neuman \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         We are asking readers and listeners  for their questions about all things homeownership and renting. Today, we're answering one of them. Submit your question below. Bidding wars  may be cooling  and mortgage rates  could dip below 6%  next year. But the shortage of \"starter homes\" — smaller, more affordable houses — continues to lock many would-be first-time buyers out of the market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gabriel Veasey, a reader in Central Texas, has children who live near Austin, Texas. They've been hunting for their first home but can't find anything affordable. He asked: Why can't they have the opportunity to buy the starter homes – the two bedroom, $200,000 [home] that's just what they need, instead of a three [bed], two [bath] or four [bed], three [bath] home for $400,000 to $500,000 that's just not within their range? … Where can my kids go? Why can't they have that opportunity to find a starter home? The housing market in Austin mirrors what's happening across the country The math doesn't work in their favor. The median income in Austin is about  $134,000  — enough for a mortgage of roughly $350,000. But in September, the median home price in Austin was about $560,000, according to  Zillow.  \"If you're a median income earner in the region, you can't afford to buy a house in the city of Austin,\" says local builder Scott Turner. Although it has slowed somewhat in recent years,  Austin remains  among the fastest-growing metros in the country and home prices have reflected that boomtown energy. But the city's housing crunch mirrors a national trend, says Mike Loftin, the CEO of Homewise, a New Mexico-based organization committed to helping first-time homebuyers. He points to Albuquerque, the largest city in his state, as an example. \"Ten years ago in Albuquerque, between 2014 and 18, about 20% of all new homes built in Albuquerque would be considered an entry-level home, a smaller, more affordable home. Today, that number is 4%,\" Loftin says. \"And this is true across the country. Home builders are not building that entry-level home.\" Supply and local regulations both play a role For decades, construction of these smaller homes has been  falling across the country . In the 1980s,  they represented about 40%  of the market, but by 2023, that percentage had dropped to just  12% . Turner says the rising cost of materials is one big reason builders are shying away from the affordable end of the market, where the profit margins are lower. \"A home that maybe used to cost $300,000 to build now costs about $450,000,\" he says, citing a 40% increase in construction materials since about 2020. The added costs from tariffs on Canadian lumber and other construction materials are expected to tack on another 7% to 10% to building costs, he says. What's more, many people who bought or refinanced during the COVID-19 pandemic are  reluctant to give up low mortgage rates  — as low as 3% — to move up into a house they would have to buy at closer to 6%. As a result, those starter homes aren't being recycled for a new generation of first-time buyers. Going back to Gabriel: The problems for his kids in Austin largely are zoning and red tape. Until two years ago, much of Austin was zoned exclusively for single-family homes, and once had one of the largest minimum lot sizes in the state, Turner says. Now, property owners  can build up to three homes  on what used to be a single-family lot, making room for more entry-level homes. But the biggest barrier to creating affordable housing remains the city's slow and expensive approval process for the construction of townhomes, condos, and new subdivisions, which can take up to two years regardless of the size of the project, he says. Turner points to Houston as a model of how to get more starter homes built — through deregulation. \"Back in the 90s, Houston started to allow very small lots … throughout its urban core and to this day, you can still go down to Houston and live in the middle of town, and still find a townhome for $400,000.\" To be sure, some existing homeowners haven't embraced  zoning changes  that promote new construction. Among other things, they argue that without formal zoning, industrial, commercial and residential uses would come into undesirably close proximity. In Austin, for instance, they have in the past  successfully sued  to block such changes. Market shifts and local initiatives could help new homebuyers out Assuming that mortgage rates do come down, there will likely be some movement in this lower end of the market, Loftin says. Being ready when the market changes is key, and he says that Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) such as his — and there are many across the country — can help. \"We do the assessment, then we do an action plan to address the barriers that you have,\" he says. \"What's the game plan for improving your credit? It's not rocket science. It's helpful because we know the system.\" \"Building a savings habit where you just have your employer just automatically deposit something, every paycheck into your savings account is super, super helpful,\" he adds. And prospective buyers don't have to put down a large amount of money, either. \"Our typical down payment from a home buyer is about 2% of the purchase price, and that includes the closing costs.\" Housing advocates have proposed initiatives aimed at increasing the number of starter homes built, though even if approved, they could take years to make a dent in the problem. There's no national plan, but states are trying out different approaches. Last year, Utah's Republican-dominated legislature  passed a bill  to provide $300 million in subsidized loans for builders and new city zoning tools in an effort to boost the construction of smaller, no-frills housing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Homewise has also proposed \"New Homes for New Mexico,\" to provide around $30,000 in direct assistance to potential homebuyers that could lower the purchase price and encourage the construction of more homes in the $300,000 range. Loftin says for builders, the subsidy means \"more buyers that can afford that home now, even with the interest rates we have today.\" New Mexico's legislature plans to take up the measure in January, Loftin says, adding that it \"appears to be gaining significant support.\" But in the meantime, starter homes can still be accessible Meanwhile, even without such measures, there are things that you can do to maximize your chances of finding a starter home that fits your budget — but those options do come with compromises. Harrison Beacher, a realtor in the Washington, D.C.-area, says he tells clients to look at home buying as a Venn diagram comparing what you want with what you can afford, where you want to live and other must-haves. \"Too many people wait for the 'dream home,' when what really changes their long-term financial story is simply getting started and making thoughtful, strategic moves over time,\" Beacher says. \"A true starter home is not about checking every box on your wish list. It is about identifying the right combination of location, affordability, and potential for appreciation,\" he says. \"You want to be close enough to the things that matter for your lifestyle and career, while staying within a price point that allows you to grow into your home instead of being stretched by it.\" Finding that perfect entry-level home might involve something realtors refer to as \"driving until you qualify,\" Turner says. In other words, if you can't find something affordable, keep looking further from the city until you can. The median home price in Austin may be way too high, but the city of Bastrop, about 30 miles southeast of Austin, is much more affordable, he says. He says the median price of a home in Bastrop in July was $336,000, about 40% lower than Austin. And for Gabriel's kids, it might make sense to look outside Austin, where homes are more affordable, and buy something now — even if it's not their dream home. Over time, they can build equity and use it to move closer to the city and what they really want. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5583959","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:29:00-04:00","title":"The East Wing Could Fully Be Demolished Soon, as Preservationists Urge Caution","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The East Wing of the White House is set for full demolition as part of President Donald Trump’s plan to build a 90,000 square foot ballroom, a project now ahead of schedule and estimated at $300 million.

A White House official not authorized to speak on the record tells NPR the demolition phase of President Trump's project to build a 90,000 square foot ballroom, is ahead of schedule. Although Trump initially said the project wouldn't \"interfere with the current building\" and would be \"near it but not touching it,\" he explained Wednesday that \"in order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure.\" The East Wing demolition, the White House official said, is going directly up to the edge of the residence and includes tearing down the East Garden Room, Family Theater and East Colonnade, as well as the complex of offices. The sight of excavators tearing into the East Wing set off alarms among preservationists, but the White House is doubling down, insisting the demolition is necessary. \"The plans changed, and the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this Phase 1 that we're now in was necessary,\" said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, in a briefing on Thursday. \"The president wants to do right by the People's House.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The offices and other facilities that were in the East Wing will be rebuilt and modernized, said Leavitt. There will also be security enhancements involving the underground bunker built under the East Wing during World War II, known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. The East Wing will \"be more beautiful and modern than ever before,\" said Leavitt. \"And in addition, there will be a big, beautiful ballroom that can hold big parties and state visits for generations to come.\" Going back at least to the year 2010, Trump has complained that the White House doesn't have an appropriate space for State Dinners and other large gatherings, often requiring large tents to be set up on the South Lawn. When it was first announced over the summer, the White House said the project would cost $200 million. Costs have already ballooned, with the president now describing it as a $300 million project, which the White House says will all still be funded by private donors. In a letter earlier this week, The National Trust for Historic Preservation called on the Trump administration to pause demolition until the ballroom plans go through \"the legally required public review processes,\" which includes input and approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. \"We are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,\" the letter said. In  a social media post by Steven Cheung , White House director of communications, said The National Trust for Historic Preservation is \"run by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games.\" A fact sheet released by the White House slammed criticisms as \"manufactured outrage\" by \"unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies\" who are \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House.\" In a statement to NPR, the White House Historical Association said it created a historic record of the East Wing prior to the demolition through digital scans and photographs. \"The East Wing and gardens have been captured in detail for the benefit of our nation and historic artifacts from the East Wing have been preserved and stored,\" the statement read. But the White House has not yet submitted construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the agency tasked with approving major renovations and construction projects on federal grounds in Washington, D.C. The White House official said they do not have a timeline for submitting the plans, but do intend to seek approval before the construction phase begins. Will Scharff, a top Trump aide and chair of the commission, said during a public commission meeting in September that the commission doesn't have jurisdiction over demolition, therefore it did not need to approve Trump's plan to tear down the East Wing to make way for the ballroom. \"Any assertion that this commission should have been consulted earlier than it has been or that it will be is simply false and represents a misunderstanding of this commission's role in that project,\" Scharff said. \"When we are submitted a plan, we will review that plan.\" The commission is currently closed due to the government shutdown and their October meeting has been canceled. Preston Bryant, the former chair of the commission for nine years and appointed by then-President Barack Obama and Trump during his first term, doesn't agree with Scharff's assertion over jurisdiction. In an email to NPR, Bryant said the commission's review and approval process includes the entire project design. \"In that process, what's demolished would be part of the project plan to be reviewed and approved. What's demolished is inherent in the design. Site preparation also is inherent in the design,\" he said. The ballroom has a hefty price tag attached to it. Trump said during a meeting on Wednesday that the project will cost around $300 million. That's up from previous estimates of $200 to $250 million. But Trump claims the ballroom is exclusively paid for by himself and private donors. The White House official said the project has secured $200 million in donations so far and provided a list of donors to NPR.

Insect enthusiast Björn Hjaltason said he found the mosquitoes on a farm in Kjós, just north of Reykjavík, earlier this month. \"At dusk on the evening of October 16th, I caught sight of a strange fly on a red wine ribbon,\" Hjaltason  told Icelandic broadcaster RUV . \"I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly. It was a female.\" Hjaltason later trapped two more. All three insects were turned over to authorities for testing, which revealed that they were two female and one male mosquitoes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Antarctica is now the  only place in the world  believed to have no mosquitoes. Climate change is causing temperatures to rise across the world, and the Arctic region is  warming at more than double the rate  of the global average. According to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, the species  Culiseta annulata  are large mosquitoes present in Europe and other Nordic countries that can live in cold weather, usually finding shelter in outbuildings and basements. Though they bite, the institute said they don't carry known infections in those areas.  One study  from 2017 said  Culiseta annulata  are often \"regarded as a biting nuisance, rather than a deadly foe.\" There are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes around the world, some of which  can transmit severe and even fatal diseases  through their bites such as malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Oct. 23rd, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story incorrectly said that mosquitos sting.

\n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 2:50 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Fresh Air \n        \n      \n\n         When the Iranian director  Jafar Panahi  showed up at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, it struck some of us as something close to a miracle. For most of the past 15 years, since he was arrested in 2010 and charged with making anti-government propaganda, Panahi had been forbidden to travel outside Iran. He'd also been banned from making movies, though he got around that restriction with great ingenuity and continued to shoot films in secret.  But then, in 2022, Panahi was arrested again and imprisoned. When he announced, seven months later, that he was beginning a hunger strike, many of us feared it would end with his death. Instead, he was released after two days and has been free to travel ever since. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's an astonishing real-life story, one that, for tension and peril, may well rival the one that Panahi tells in his new film,  It Was Just an Accident . This remarkable movie, which ended up winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes, feels like a liberated work in every sense.  In his recent, more under-the-radar films, like  3 Faces  or  No Bears , Panahi sometimes seemed to be speaking in code, or through layers of parable. But there's nothing cryptic or ruminative about  It Was Just an Accident . It's a blast of pure anti-authoritarian rage, a gripping and often shockingly funny revenge thriller that, as Panahi has said in interviews, was informed by the stories of people he met in prison. It begins on a dark night, when an auto mechanic named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasseri) hears something in his shop that catches his attention. It's the sound of a customer's prosthetic leg, clomping slowly along, and it clearly triggers painful memories.  Some time ago, Vahid was one of several people arrested while protesting for workers' rights. In prison, they were brutally tortured by a man they came to know as Peg Leg, because of his prosthetic. Now, Vahid could swear that the customer in his garage, whose name is Eghbal, is Peg Leg himself. But since Vahid was blindfolded during his torture, he can't trust his eyes, only his ears. What Vahid does next is shocking: The following day, after tailing Eghbal for a while in his van, Vahid knocks the man out with a shovel, ties him up, transports him to a remote area, and tries to bury him alive. But Eghbal regains consciousness and begs Vahid to stop, claiming that he isn't the culprit and has no idea what Vahid is talking about.  Vahid puts Eghbal back in his van and drives off to find others who can verify the man's identity. One of his fellow former prisoners is a photographer named Shiva, played by Maryam Afshari, who, when he finds her, is in the middle of taking a couple's pre-wedding photos. The bride, who's dressed in her full white gown, turns out to be one of Peg Leg's victims, too. Before long, Vahid's van has picked up so many passengers that it starts to resemble a clown car, or maybe the yellow Volkswagen van from  Little Miss Sunshine . Most of those passengers want Eghbal dead, but none of them can be 100% certain he's the guilty party, and they bicker relentlessly about what to do next.  As deadly serious as everything is, Panahi pushes the action and the banter to often-farcical extremes; he's made a road movie in which the characters keep going around and around in circles. It's startling just how funny  It Was Just an Accident  can be; it's attuned to the comic futility as well as the horror of the situation. There's an especially dry running gag in which Vahid finds himself forced to bribe various people, from security guards to hospital nurses — a jab at the banal everyday corruption of life under an oppressive system. As day bleeds into night,  It Was Just an Accident  builds to a dramatic climax of lacerating emotional force — a sequence so intense, you can practically feel Panahi's rage burning a hole through the screen. His movie, in weighing the question of revenge vs. mercy, is an obvious warning to authoritarian regimes everywhere.  But it also feels like a warning to people living under those regimes. Several weeks ago, I moderated a Q&A with Panahi in Los Angeles, a city he hadn't visited in almost 20 years. While we were talking before the Q&A, Panahi turned to me with a grave look on his face and said, \"I'm worried about your country.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94592","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:26:00-23:00","title":"In an era of techno-dystopia, Sudan Archives' 'The BPM' imagines a liberated future","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses Sudan Archives' album 'The BPM,' created by singer and producer Brittney Parks, as a reflection on a future where technology and human identity are synchronized.

It is often used in the context of motion, wanting to align with someone else's rhythm, but I kept thinking about the old process by which digital music libraries would be added to an MP3 player. There was a connection being made, running along the cable linking your computer to your iPod, or whatever other gizmo, all digital, but also mechanized and taken offline. After all, the player was an object housing the files in a way that made them accessible out on the street. Once the process was complete, the two repositories were paired but partitioned; adding new music from the library to the player required syncing again. That interfacing is at the center of  The BPM , which wants to sync the real and digital selves, so that they are mirrored but localized. The BPM  follows a grief-stricken woman who comes into contact with her digital avatar, a siren dubbed \"gadget girl.\" \"I've always been a gadget girl,\" Brittney Parks, the singer and producer behind Sudan Archives,  told   The New York Times . \"The more gadgets I've learned how to communicate with and use, the more powerful I became.\" Over the course of two EPs and three albums, the artist has taken multi-instrumentalism seriously, using her background as a violinist as a baseline for an expansion into both classic and modern forms: mandolin, synthesizer, bass, keyboards, percussion and drum programming. With each release, there has been a greater emphasis on the gadgets, their signals and feedback.  The BPM  is an album that recognizes a cybernated world of augmented reality — not in the ridiculous, metaversal sense, but one where contact with an electronic device can bring about physical change, even growth. A subtext of club music is that \"electronic\" is an interface straddling analog and computational spaces, where a programmed input can result in a visceral output, and on this album Parks returns to the sounds of Detroit, where much of her family is, to conjure the liberated feeling beat engineering brings her. It's one in conjunction with the long-standing ethic of dance music, pulse and movement as a hard reset, only refreshed for her particular philosophy: the haptic feedback of producing inducing a kind of out-of-body experience. In  a YouTube mini-doc  on the album, Parks had an energizing take on our digital age. To her, staying human can mean augmenting yourself with technology, \"computer-generated\" being part of a holistic practice, not a simulated one. It's easy to be overwhelmed by visions of a brain-rotted techno-dystopia, which somehow always seems nearly at hand, but Parks dares to dream of a future dictated not by delusions and dissociation but by the sync as a self-actualizing process. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The album feels like a case in point in more ways than one. The Sudan Archives project has always been built on the violin, it is her anchor and origin story, and has long been used to insinuate her groundedness, but this record is computerized in a deliberate way — not just offsetting rigid notions of chamber artistry but demonstrating that Parks' outer string wonk isn't at odds with her inner beat freak. Just as key to that origin story is making beats on an iPad and frequenting Los Angeles' experimental club night Low End Theory.  The BPM  straddles house, techno, trap and R&B, but in the least binary ways possible. Throughout, the album feels unbound, not simply because dance music is physically freeing, but because, in embracing the gadget girl avatar, Parks has activated some latent part of her style and sound, decompartmentalizing ideas and ideals that were once stored on separate drives; syncing them. That integrated electronic archive gives way to rich cultural and personal chronologies, too. When she sings, \"The BPM is the power,\" over and over on the title track, it is as if she is literally tapping into an energy source allowing for such a self-fullfilling, hypermedial mechanism to take place. But beyond  The BPM 's odes to electronic music, its sound is one of melding the vulnerable person you are IRL with the confident free spirit you can be virtually. For Parks, that isn't simply \"being online\" but exploring herself through the many machines she uses to produce music. Just look at the cover, which depicts the artist as a cyborg wired to some unseen mainframe. In the doc, Parks notes that she is drawing from her on-stage setup, where she is connected to various contraptions all converging to a singular outflow. (To get some sense of her system, watch her play violin and DJ simultaneously while rolling around in a doorless Bronco for a live performance of \" DEAD ,\" or operate an Akai drum machine and a pedalboard mid- Dungeon Session  for \" ChevyS10 .\") The cover is such a stark contrast to the one on her debut album, 2019's  Athena , which cast her in bronze, holding her primary instrument up with one hand like a totem as if she was acting in deference to its history and the corresponding power. The violin is still featured prominently, but now it exists as part of an array, another tool in an arsenal allowing her to travel through cords along an information superhighway of her own making. And the music of  The BPM , like its cover, is about traversing that technologic expanse to realize a modified version of the self extending beyond physical limitations. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5514834","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:15:00-23:00","title":"Virginia Giuffre recounts a lifetime of abuse in her memoir 'Nobody's Girl'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of sexual trafficking and abuse, recounts in her memoir 'Nobody's Girl' the abuse she endured from an early age, including by her own father, and later by powerful figures such as Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew.

Behind them stood a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime partner of the late Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein himself took the photo. Her name was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the most public accusers of abuse by Epstein and the many powerful men Giuffre says she was trafficked to in the early 2000s. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida on charges related to soliciting prostitution. His 2019 federal sex-trafficking charges were dismissed after his death by suicide while awaiting trial in New York. Maxwell was later convicted of crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors and is serving a 20-year sentence in Texas. Days before the publication of Giuffre's memoir,  Nobody's Girl,  Buckingham Palace released a statement from Prince Andrew. It said he had agreed to give up his title as Duke of York amid fresh scrutiny of the allegations. In  Nobody's Girl , Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in 2001 and that he guessed correctly she was then 17 years old. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying. \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled — as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. Prince Andrew has consistently denied Giuffre's accusations. Epstein  reached a financial settlement  with Giuffre in 2009. Prince Andrew  later settled  with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide in April, at age 41, just months before her book's release. Her collaborator on  Nobody's Girl , author and journalist Amy Wallace, and Giuffre's younger brother, Sky Roberts, spoke about the memoir with  Morning Edition's  Leila Fadel. Here are five takeaways from the conversation.  1. Giuffre called her father \"the original betrayer\" The memoir begins with the abuse Giuffre said started when she was about 7 years old. Before calling out Epstein, Maxwell and their wealthy friends, Wallace said Giuffre wanted to name her \"original betrayer.\" \"When we began unpacking all of that, she had always said 'I was abused by a family friend,' and that was true as far as it went, but she had also been abused by her own father,\" Wallace said. \"You have to understand Virginia's history… victims of sexual trafficking are not born, they are made, and they are made by terrible experiences that they have over years.\" Giuffre was 16 when she met Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago resort, where she worked as a locker room attendant in the spa. \"And up to that point, the world that had been revealed to her, was a world in which adult men had sex with young girls, children, and didn't pay the price for it,\" Wallace added. Giuffre's father denies these accusations. 2. Her \"toughest battle\" came at home  Giuffre was married for over 20 years and had three children. Near the end of her life, she was estranged from her husband. Her brother said she had begun to speak openly about the domestic abuse she had allegedly experienced over the years. \"She fought off Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and she was very proud of that with her survivor sister. She wanted to continue that advocacy work. But I would say, the hardest fight of her battle was in her backyard with her husband, and she was a little embarrassed about that, as anybody would be coming forward,\" Roberts said. Giuffre's husband denies these allegations. 3. Her brothers were by her side before her death in Australia Earlier this year, Giuffre was recovering from a car crash and renal failure. Her brothers traveled to Australia to help care for her. \"At one point, we had a jet lined up for her on a tarmac ready to bring her home so she could get medical treatment,\" Roberts shared. \"We were with her in her final couple of weeks. And, you know, I was, I was, I was the one that found my sister.\" Having displayed so much strength facing the legal and public battles against Epstein and others, her brother says they thought she \"would make it through because she'd pulled through so many times before.\" 4. Giuffre wanted the Epstein files released President Trump has not ruled out a pardon for Maxwell. \"Well, I'll take a look at it. I'll speak to the DOJ,\" Trump  said earlier this month  to a CNN reporter regarding a possible pardon for Maxwell. \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider — I don't know anything about it. I will speak to the DOJ.\" Wallace said those who doubt Maxwell's involvement in the abuse, \"will get their answers in this book.\" \"She was not on the sidelines,\" Wallace said. \"She was sexually abusing herself. She was telling girls to sexually service her. She was hurting some of those girls when she was angry at them in a sexual way.\" Roberts said he was astounded to hear the president's stance on a possible pardon for Maxwell. \"At one point he ran his campaign on the fact that he would release these [Epstein] files,\" Roberts said. \"My sister had hope that he would. She was hopeful.\" 5. Giuffre's story is larger than the narrative of sex abuse Wallace said Epstein was not an anomaly or \"some super apex predator,\" but rather a sign of our times. \"This is part of our culture,\" she said. \"Wealthy people, powerful people get to treat people less wealthy terribly,\" she said. \"And I think that's why it resonates beyond sexual abuse. I think people are sick of it.\" This article discusses suicide.

It's of now-disgraced Prince Andrew with his hand around the waist of a teen girl in a pink top and jeans. That was Virginia Roberts Giuffre. As an adult, she was one of the most outspoken survivors of abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell. Prince Andrew was one of many powerful men that Giuffre says she was trafficked to by the wealthy pair. On Friday, Buckingham Palace released a statement from Prince Andrew. It said he had given up his title as Duke of York amid fresh scrutiny of the allegations, which he has consistently denied. Virginia wrote about this and all she endured in a book called \"Nobody's Girl.\" But before it was published, she died by suicide in the spring. I spoke to Amy Wallace, her collaborator on the book, along with her brother Sky Roberts. And a warning - sexual abuse and suicide come up in our conversation. The book opens with the last email Wallace received from Virginia. AMY WALLACE: She basically just said, in the case of my passing, I need and want this book to be published - not just for me, but for all survivors. FADEL: Sky, you're written about so lovingly. You were her baby brother. You were with her in Australia near the end of her life. What do you want the world to know about your sister? SKY ROBERTS: I look at my sister as a hero. But at a very fundamental level, like, you can tell in that book, like, how loving she was and how much she wanted to kind of protect me in a lot of ways. But then, as she progressed and she got older and became a mother, you know, there's even circumstances where she was protecting her own daughter. And then I think that expanded to her protecting your daughters, because when she held her daughter for the first time, it was like, this can never happen again. FADEL: Amy, I want to talk more about the beginning of the book and her childhood. The book goes back much further, to abuses that she first encountered at - what? - 7 years old? If you could just talk about what it was like for Virginia to write in such detail. WALLACE: Well, I mean, the entire book is an exercise in trying to show her in all her complexity. FADEL: Yes. WALLACE: And when we began unpacking all of that, she had always said, I was abused by a family friend. And that was... FADEL: Yeah. WALLACE: ...True, as far as it went. But she had also been abused by her own father. As we worked on the book, she said, how can I be calling out all these people who came later - Epstein, Maxwell, all of their wealthy and influential friends who she was trafficked to - and not acknowledge or name the original betrayer of me, the original abuser of me? You have to understand Virginia's history, which is a lot of the victims have tragedy in their pasts, to understand that victims of sexual trafficking are not born. They are made. And they are made by a terrible experience that they have over years. And when you understand that Virginia was just 16 years old when she met Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago, where she was working as a $9-an-hour towel girl in the spa. And up to that point, the world that had been revealed to her was a world in which adult men had sex with young girls - children - and didn't pay the price for it. FADEL: Yeah. And when you say her original betrayer, you're referring to her father? WALLACE: Her father. So you have to understand - she didn't believe that if she walked out the door of Epstein's Manhattan townhouse that the world outside was going to be any better to her. FADEL: Yeah. And you note in the book that you reached out to her father. Actually, there's a lot of meticulous reporting done in this, reaching out to everybody she's accused, and he's continued to deny that. Throughout Virginia's pages, she writes about not being believed - about how it made her feel worthless as a child and teen, about the way she was broken down and used. What Virginia didn't write and what came to light later was that she says her husband was physically abusing her. It's something he denies. ROBERTS: Our sister was very transparent with us, especially towards the end of her relationship, about the abuse that she was incurring for 22 years throughout her marriage, on and off. She fought off Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and she was very proud of that with her survivor sisters. She wanted to continue that advocacy work. But, like, I would say the hardest fight of her battle was in her backyard with her husband. And she was a little embarrassed about that, as anybody would be coming forward. She's a strong figure. FADEL: At the end of her life, Sky was with her. ROBERTS: She was laughing when we were there 'cause the chickens would chase me around, and we nicknamed one Raptor at one point. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: But, yes. We were with her in her final couple of weeks, and... FADEL: Yeah. ROBERTS: You know, I was the one that found my sister. And... FADEL: I'm so sorry, Sky. I didn't know that. ROBERTS: Yeah. It was - you know, I think we all thought she would make it through because she'd pulled through so many times before. FADEL: You know, I've been thinking a lot. The fight around Epstein is not over. Right now there is a battle over the release of more Epstein documents. And then there's the question of whether Ghislaine Maxwell might get a pardon, which is something President Trump has not ruled out. I mean, what are you thinking, Sky, as you see what's happening around Epstein and Maxwell even today and what she would think? ROBERTS: I think it's very important to first start with the fact that this is the president of the United States. And at one point, he ran his campaign on the fact that he would release these files. My sister had hope that he would. WALLACE: Yeah, and I would add to that. Anyone who has any questions about how involved Ghislaine Maxwell was in the actual sexual abuse of girls will get their answers in this book. She was involved. She was not on the sidelines. This is a woman who has never offered any solace or empathy to the people that she hurt or that Epstein hurt. Jeffrey Epstein has been dead for years, but the specter of him lives on. And I'm so grateful for that, frankly, because this didn't die with him. He's not just some super apex predator who was an anomaly. This is part of our culture. Wealthy people, powerful people get to treat people less wealthy terribly. And I think that's why it resonates beyond sexual abuse. I think people are sick of it. FADEL: Amy Wallace and Sky Roberts, thank you so much for speaking with us. WALLACE: Thank you for having us. ROBERTS: Thank you. FADEL: The book \"Nobody's Girl\" is out this week. It's Virginia Roberts Giuffre's story. If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

Here's what to know \n         By Kat Lonsdorf \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump's federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to both Oregon and Illinois are facing a pair of legal litmus tests — including one at the Supreme Court — that could be decided in the coming days. At the heart of both challenges is whether or not to defer to the president's assessment that major cities in both places — Portland and Chicago — are lawless and in need of immediate military intervention to protect federal property and immigration officers, despite local leaders and law enforcement saying otherwise. Both deployments were done against the wishes of Democratic state governors, and were quickly temporarily blocked by district courts. On Monday, a divided panel on the  9th Circuit court of appeals  overturned a temporary restraining order put in place by a federal judge in Portland, siding with the Trump administration, however another temporary restraining order remains in place. That ruling came days after the  7th Circuit court of appeals upheld  a similar block from a federal judge in Illinois on the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The Trump administration has  asked the Supreme Court  to intervene. Movement in both cases is expected in the coming days, in what has been a dizzying pingpong of legal disputes around Trump's use of the military domestically in  several Democratic-led cities  around the country . And while any decision will only impact troop deployment in an individual state, they could impact how courts weigh in on such cases going forward — and embolden the administration, legal experts say. \"This could be a pretty seminal week in terms of the bigger legal fight over domestic deployments,\" says Scott R. Anderson, a fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution and senior editor of Lawfare. The 9th Circuit and Portland, Ore.  The 9th Circuit's decision earlier this week only applies to one of the two temporary restraining orders that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued this month to block the National Guard deployments — meaning that troops can still not be on the streets in Portland. But the  federal government has asked  Immergut to remove her second temporary order. A court hearing has been  scheduled for Friday  to discuss the dissolution of that order. The 9th Circuit is also deciding whether or not to revisit the ruling made earlier this week with a larger group of judges — and that decision could come before Immergut's deadline. Trump has said that the 9th Circuit decision has made him feel empowered to send the National Guard to any city where he deems it necessary. \"That was the decision. I can send the National Guard if I see problems,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday. In recent days, Trump has renewed an interest in  sending troops to San Francisco . Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University Loyola Law School and an expert in constitutional law, worries the ruling by the 9th Circuit \"authorized blindness to facts.\" \"It said [Trump] can decide that there's a war when there's nothing but bluebirds,\" he says, noting that's likely why an immediate call for a full review was made. \"I fully expect a larger group of 9th Circuit judges to say we don't have to be blind to what's actually going on in order to give ample deference to the Trump administration.\" The Supreme Court and Chicago At the same time, the Trump administration has issued an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on whether National Guard troops can be deployed in Illinois, after the 7th Circuit court of appeals upheld a district court's block. It's unknown when, or if, the Supreme Court will issue a decision, although experts expect it in the coming days as well. The decision, although not precedent-setting, will likely clarify the president's power to deploy federal military resources — and how deferential the courts should be to his administration's presentation of facts — but only to a point. Emergency decisions are usually short, without much reasoning provided by the justices, experts say. \"It ends up kind of putting the onus on district and appellate courts to read the tea leaves of those interim orders to inform these much larger questions in very different factual environments, you know, possibly months in the future,\" says Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. He says that while the emergency decisions from the Supreme Court don't apply broadly, in recent months, some judges have started to treat them as if they do. \"I think what we're going to get in at least the medium term is even more confusion than we've had so far,\" he says. But just how the Supreme Court might weigh in isn't clear. \"I think it's a harder case for the Supreme Court than some people might think, who go in with the assumption the Supreme Court is just naturally inclined toward the administration's positions on things — and it is in many contexts,\" says Anderson of the Brookings Institution. He says that while it's standard for courts to be deferential to the president, it's also standard to believe the facts presented by the local courts. \"That is a tricky, tricky sort of situation here,\" Anderson says. What could this mean for possible deployments going forward? These two expected decisions will only directly affect Portland or Chicago. But the implications of both – especially something from the Supreme Court – could have ripple effects in future litigation. Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, says that what's particularly worrying is that the Department of Justice has been  expressly celebrating high arrest counts by law enforcement in places like Chicago , while still saying the military is necessary to help. \"If the bar is so low that the President can use the military at a time when his administration is touting how effective civilian law enforcement is, it becomes hard to imagine a scenario where he couldn't deploy the military,\" she says. Experts say that these legal challenges are just the beginning of what will surely be a long and winding road through the U.S. court system. \"This is really just the first battle. There are a lot of legal questions that come after this,\" Anderson says. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   We are finding out how much leeway the courts will allow President Trump as he tries to deploy the National Guard into American cities. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Yeah. Two cases this week involve Chicago and Portland. The administration has also sent extra federal agents to San Francisco amid talk that troops would go there next. INSKEEP: NPR's Kat Lonsdorf is following all this. Kat, good morning. KAT LONSDORF, BYLINE: Hey, good morning. INSKEEP: What's the central issue here? LONSDORF: Well, at the heart of both of these cases is whose facts to believe about the situation on the ground in these cities, the president's or local officials and law enforcement. Experts tell me how the courts rule will at least start to set the bar for that and help define what constitutes a situation where the military can be deployed at the president's will domestically, even against local officials' wishes. There will still be a lot left to be decided, likely well into next year. So all of this is just the beginning of what will surely be a long and winding road through the U.S. court system. INSKEEP: Yeah. I guess we should just remember the Constitution would seem to forbid the deployment of troops in this ways, along with various laws. But the question... LONSDORF: Right. INSKEEP: ...Is, when can the president decide to do this, and who gets to decide if the conditions are sufficient? That's a crucial... LONSDORF: Exactly. INSKEEP: ...Thing as well. Well, what are the details of the specific cases? LONSDORF: Yeah. Let's start with Portland. So on Monday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a temporary restraining order put in place by a judge in Portland, basically siding with the Trump administration, saying troops could be deployed in Portland. But there's still another temporary restraining order by that same federal judge in place, and so there are no troops in the streets yet. INSKEEP: Got it. LONSDORF: The federal government has asked that judge to remove that second temporary order. A court hearing has been scheduled for that tomorrow. And at the same time, the 9th Circuit is also deciding whether or not to revisit the case with a larger group of judges, basically challenging that ruling. The ruling was a big win for the Trump administration. Trump told reporters that he felt empowered by it to send National Guard troops wherever he deems necessary. Meanwhile, a lot of legal experts I talked to were worried by it, saying basically it allows for Trump to claim whatever he wants about the situation on the ground in these places, and courts should believe him. Here's Justin Levitt. He's an expert in constitutional law at Loyola Law School. JUSTIN LEVITT: It authorized blindness to facts. It said you can decide that there's a war when there's nothing but bluebirds. LONSDORF: He said he's confident a larger review by the 9th Circuit would disagree with that. INSKEEP: OK. So that is the set of cases around Portland. What's going on with Chicago? LONSDORF: Right. Last Friday, the Trump administration filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on whether or not National Guard troops can be deployed in Chicago after losing an appeal to a lower court. Steve, as you know, there have been a flurry of court cases around these National Guard deployments, and this is the first one to make it to the Supreme Court. So that's one reason why people are really watching it. We don't know when or if the Supreme Court will issue an emergency decision, although it will likely be quick. If one is issued, it won't set precedent. It will only apply to Chicago. But it will provide some clarity on how the Supreme Court is thinking about all of this, only to a point, though. These emergency decisions are usually short - just a few sentences - and don't provide a lot of reasoning from the judges. And while lower courts don't have to follow the decision, they will look to it, and it may not provide a whole lot of direction beyond a simple yes or no. INSKEEP: Yeah. That's been the case in a bunch of Supreme Court rulings - emergency docket rulings this year. They have generally deferred to the president and generally not said why. So I guess we wait to find out what happens in this case. LONSDORF: Exactly. INSKEEP: NPR's Kat Lonsdorf. Thanks so much. LONSDORF: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580471","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:19:00-04:00","title":"Would you shave your head for free movie tickets?

The measure,  intended to  shorten the amount of time successful songs spend on the Hot 100, knocks 10 tracks off this week's chart — including Swims' \"Lose Control,\" which spent more than two years on the Hot 100 — and in the process cements a record that could take a decade to surpass. Billboard  has long had a problem with streaming — as well as with radio stations' growing reluctance to pull hit songs from heavy rotation after many, many months. When you look at the list of the songs with the longest-ever runs on the Hot 100 (a chart whose history dates back to 1958), they're all from the streaming era. Streaming services use algorithms that feed people songs they've already played, and that's created a doom loop that's allowed recent-vintage songs like  The Weeknd 's \"Blinding Lights\" (90 weeks on the Hot 100),  Glass Animals ' \"Heat Waves\" (91 weeks) and Swims' \"Lose Control\" (112 weeks) to stay on the chart for absurdly long runs. Until this week,  Billboard  employed a system that seemed reasonable enough: Songs were pulled from the Hot 100 if they'd dropped below No. 25 after 52 weeks, or below No. 50 after 20 weeks. That generally prevented the chart's lower reaches from getting crowded with stubborn-but-declining hits — endlessly charting smashes like  Post Malone 's \"I Had Some Help (feat.  Morgan Wallen )\" and  Shaboozey 's \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" finally dropped off the chart in recent months thanks to this system — but didn't have an answer for songs that just weren't descending far enough or quickly enough. Effective this week, the thresholds have moved dramatically, in ways that will reshape the charts in the months and years to come. Now, if a song drops below No. 5 after 78 weeks — a year and a half! — it's gone. (Consider that \"Lose Control\" sat at No. 6 before  The Life of a Showgirl  came along.) If a song drops below No. 10 after 52 weeks, it's gone. If it drops below No. 25 after 26 weeks? Bzzzt. And if it drops below No. 50 after 20 weeks? That's a wrap. Billboard  is reserving the right to bend its own rules and keep songs on the chart beyond those benchmarks on a case-by-case basis, and you can see a handful of exceptions on this week's chart. Most notably,  Billie Eilish 's \"Wildflower\" — the longest-charting song left on the Hot 100 — is in its 70th week on the chart and sits at No. 50. But, while it's lasted way more than 26 weeks, it's actually  climbing , jumping from No. 63. Also, once the holidays roll around, the usual chestnuts won't be held to precisely the same standards, provided they rank at No. 50 or higher, same as in previous years. So be sure to take a moment, light a candle and pause to reflect on such once-immortal, now-vanquished eternals as…  [lights dim as a screen bears the words \"In Memoriam\"]   Lady Gaga  and  Bruno Mars ' \"Die With a Smile\" (60 weeks),  Benson Boone 's \"Beautiful Things\" and \"Sorry I'm Here for Someone Else\" (89 and 32 weeks, respectively), Morgan Wallen's \"I'm the Problem\" and \"Just in Case\" (36 and 29 weeks, respectively) and  Kendrick Lamar 's \"Luther (feat.  SZA )\" (46 weeks), as well as songs by  sombr  and  BigXthaPlug . We'll never know how long they might have lasted under the old system — except in the case of \"Lose Control,\" which we can state with virtual certainty would have left the Hot 100 sometime after the next Ice Age. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/miami-heat-terry-rozier-gambling-probe-de98ecb76bb8f13b85f4c5ac62f66221","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:31:26+00:00","title":"Trail Blazers Coach Chauncey Billups and Heat Player Terry Rozier Arrested in Sports Betting Scandal Tied to Mafia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. federal government has arrested Chauncey Billups, the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, and Terry Rozier, a player for the Miami Heat, along with over 30 others, in a major sports betting scandal involving organized crime.

updates on  the arrests of Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and the Miami Heat’s Terry Rozier in a sports betting case \n    \n \n NEW YORK (AP) — The head coach of the  Portland Trail Blazers  and a player for the  Miami Heat  were arrested Thursday along with more than 30 other people in two cases  alleging sprawling criminal schemes  to rake in millions by rigging sports bets and poker games involving Mafia families, authorities said. Portland coach  Chauncey Billups  was charged with participating in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games in Las Vegas, Miami, Manhattan and the Hamptons that were backed by La Cosa Nostra organized crime families. Heat guard  Terry Rozier  is accused in a separate scheme to concoct fraudulent bets by exploiting insider information about NBA athletes. The indictments unsealed in New York create a massive cloud for the NBA — which opened its season this week — and show how certain types of wagers are  vulnerable to massive fraud  in the growing, multi-billion-dollar  legal sports-betting industry . Joseph Nocella, the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of New York, called it “one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalized in the United States.” “My message to the defendants who’ve been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,” Nocella said. “Your luck has run out.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Billups and Rozier expected to make their first court appearances Both men  face money laundering and wire fraud conspiracy charges and were expected to make initial court appearances later Thursday. Also charged is former NBA assistant coach and player Damon Jones, who is accused of participating in both schemes. \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n     \n     \n \n     \n         \n                 \n             \n         \n                 \n             \n     \n     \n         \n         \n     \n     \n \n    \n    \n        \n             \n                 \n                    AP AUDIO: Heat’s Rozier and Trail Blazers’ Billups among dozens arrested in gambling probe tied to the Mafia\n                 \n             \n        \n    \n    \n     At a news conference, FBI Director Kash Patel says dozens of people were arrested in connection with an illegal sports betting case. \n    \n “The fraud is mind boggling,”  FBI Director Kash Patel  told reporters. “We’re talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation.” The alleged fraud, however, paled in comparison to the riches the athletes earned on the court. Billups, who was inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame  last year, had about $106 million in career earnings over his 17-year career. Rozier made about $160 million in his stops in Boston, Miami and Charlotte. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Billups and Rozier have been placed on leave from their teams, according to the NBA, which said it is cooperating with authorities. “We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,” the NBA said in a statement. A message seeking comment was left Thursday morning with Billups. Rozier’s lawyer, Jim Trusty, said in a statement that his client is “not a gambler” and “looks forward to winning this fight.” Trusty said the FBI had previously said his client was not a target in the probe. But at 6 a.m. “they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel,” Trusty said. ”It is unfortunate that instead of allowing him to self-surrender they opted for a photo op. They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case.” Messages were left Thursday at a phone number and email address listed in public records for Jones. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Mafia families profited off gambling scheme, officials say The poker scheme cheated at least $7 million out of unsuspecting gamblers who were lured into rigged games with the chance to compete against former professional basketball players like Billups and Jones. The games were fixed using sophisticated cheating technology, such as altered card-shuffling machines, hidden cameras in poker chip trays, special sunglasses and even X-ray equipment built into the table to read the cards of unsuspecting players, authorities allege.  The scheme often made use of illegal poker games run by New York crime families that required them to share a portion of their proceeds with the Gambino, Genovese and Bonnano crime families, according to court papers. Members of those families, in turn, also helped commit violent acts, including assault, extortion and robbery, to ensure repayment of debts and the continued success of the operation, officials said in court documents. Prosecutors asked a judge to detain Mafia members implicated in the case, as well as the ringleaders of the poker scheme. Prosecutors are arguing for releasing Billups and Jones but with “substantial bail conditions,” including a prohibition on any form of gambling and travel restrictions. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Athletes accused of leaving games early In the sports betting scheme, Rozier and other defendants are accused of accessing private information from NBA players or coaches that could impact a player’s performance and giving that information to others so they could place wagers. Players sometimes altered their performance or took themselves out of games early to rig prop bets — a type of wager that allows gamblers to bet on whether a player will exceed a certain statistical number, such as whether the player will finish over or under a certain total of points, rebounds or assists, according to the indictment. In one instance, Rozier, while playing for the  Charlotte Hornets  in 2023, told people he was planning to leave the game early with a supposed injury, allowing gamblers to place wagers earning them tens of thousands of dollars, authorities say. That game against the  New Orleans Pelicans  raised eyebrows at the time. Rozier played the first 9 minutes and 36 seconds of the game before leaving, citing a foot issue. He did not play again that season. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Posts still online from March 23, 2023, show that some bettors were furious with sportsbooks that evening when it became evident that Rozier was not going to return to the game after the first quarter, with many turning to social media to say that something “shady” had happened regarding the prop bets involving his stats for that night. The indictments contain the descriptions of several unnamed NBA players whose injury status and availability for certain games were the source of betting activity. Those players are not accused of any wrongdoing, and there is no indication that they would have even known what was being said about their status for those games. Those players include  LeBron James ,  Anthony Davis  and  Damian Lillard . Their identities are clear based on a review of corresponding injury reports surrounding games mentioned in the indictment. The indictments show that certain defendants shared information about the availability of those players in a game on March 24, 2023, involving the Portland Trail Blazers, and two games in 2023 and 2024 involving the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA had investigated Rozier previously. He was in uniform as  the Heat played the Magic  on Wednesday in Orlando, Florida, in the season opener for both teams, though he did not play in the game. ___ Durkin Richer reported from Washington, and Reynolds reported from Miami.

Tuesday, putting the ChatGPT maker in direct competition with Google as more internet users rely on artificial intelligence to answer their questions. Making its popular AI chatbot a gateway to online searches could allow OpenAI, the world’s most valuable startup, to pull in more internet traffic and the revenue made from digital advertising. It could also further cut off the lifeblood of online publishers if ChatGPT so effectively feeds people summarized information that they stop exploring the internet and clicking on traditional web links.

Chrome’s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat. But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market. Microsoft ended up abandoning Explorer and introducing its Edge browser, which operates similarly to Chrome and holds a distant third place in market share behind Apple’s Safari. Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup. Altman said he expects a chatbot interface to replace a traditional browser’s URL bar as the center of how he hopes people will use the internet in the future. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Tabs were great, but we haven’t seen a lot of browser innovation since then,” he said on a video presentation aired Tuesday. A premium feature of the ChatGPT Atlas browser is an “agent mode” that accesses the laptop and effectively clicks around the internet on the person’s behalf, armed with a users’ browser history and what they are seeking to learn and explaining its process as it searches. “It’s using the internet for you,” Altman said. Harrington, the Forrester analyst, says another way of thinking about that is it’s “taking personality away from you.” “Your profile will be personally attuned to you based on all the information sucked up about you. OK, scary,” Harrington said. “But is it really you, really what you’re thinking, or what that engine decides it’s going to do? ... And will it add in preferred solutions based on ads?”  About 60% of Americans  overall — and 74% of those under 30 — use AI to find information at least some of the time, making online searches one of the most popular uses of AI technology, according to findings from an  Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research  poll taken over the summer. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Google since last year has automatically  provided AI-generated responses  that attempt to answer a person’s search query, appearing at the top of results. Reliance on AI chatbots to summarize information they collect online has raised a number of concerns, including the technology’s propensity to confidently spout false information, a problem known as hallucination. The way that chatbots trained on online content spout new writings has been particularly troubling to the news industry, leading The New York Times and other outlets to sue OpenAI for copyright infringement and others, including The Associated Press, to sign licensing deals. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A study of four top AI assistants including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini released Wednesday showed nearly half their responses were flawed and fell short of the standards of “high-quality” journalism. The research from the European Broadcasting Union, a group of public broadcasters in 56 countries, compiled the results of more than 3,000 responses to news-related questions to help ascertain quality responses and identify problems to fix. —— Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed to this story."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-media-rules-new-press-corps-b14b8cef6ba63cdac17c8ffac375e615","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"21:50:21Z","title":"Conservative Media Outlets Join Pentagon Press Corps Amid Backlash from Legacy News Organizations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a controversial new press policy introduced by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, several conservative media outlets including The Gateway Pundit, National Pulse, Human Events, Tim Pool, Just the News, Frontlines by Turning Point USA, and LindellTV have agreed to join the Pentagon press corps.

and will take their place in the Pentagon to cover Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the U.S. military. The new Pentagon press corps will include the Gateway Pundit, the National Pulse, Human Events, podcaster Tim Pool, the Just the News website founded by journalist John Solomon, Frontlines by Turning Point USA and LindellTV, run by “MyPillow” CEO Mike Lindell. The Pentagon’s announcement came less than a week after dozens of reporters from outlets like The New York Times, The Associated Press, CNN and the Washington Post turned in their access badges rather than agree to a policy the journalists say will restrict them to covering news approved by Hegseth. Hegseth’s spokesman, Sean Parnell, announced the “next generation” of the Pentagon press corps with more than 60 journalists who had agreed to the new policy. He said 26 journalists who had previously been part of the press corps were among the signees. The department wouldn’t say who any of them were, but several outlets reposted his message on X saying they had signed on. There isn’t even unanimity among organizations that appeal to conservative consumers.

Many have been reporting aggressively, for example, on stories about  strikes against boats  in central America alleged to be part of the drug trade. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n By not being in the Pentagon, “reporters will have to work harder, there’s no question about it,” said Barbara Starr, a longtime Pentagon reporter retired from CNN. “But the real price is paid by the American people and the American military families,” Starr said. “Military families who have their sons and daughters serving, they want to know everything and they want to know it fast.” Starr wondered about Hegseth: “What is he so afraid of?” New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote a biting piece about the defense secretary over the weekend titled  “Fraidy-Cat at the Pentagon.”  But Hegseth’s boss, President Trump, has expressed support for the new media policy and Hegseth’s aggressive moves mirror some of those made by the administration.

The Trump administration dismissed widespread criticism as \"manufactured outrage\" in  a fact sheet  released Tuesday, which outlines the various renovations that presidents have made to the property over the last century and suggests this one is no different. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House — a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence,\" the White House said. The White House has undergone renovations both large and small since its creation in 1792. But this would be the biggest addition — in scope and size — since the 1940s, Priya Jain, the chair of the Society of Architectural Historians' Heritage Conservation Committee,  told NPR . \"In the list that was issued yesterday, if you look at it closely, all the changes after 1942 have been limited to the interior,\" Jain said. \"And the ones on the exterior either involved simple restoration or minor site additions like the tennis court and the pavilion, which are limited by their scope, size and visibility to have any negative impact on the historic building.\" Here's a look at how presidents have changed the White House. 1700s and 1800s: The White House is built and rebuilt The cornerstone for the White House was laid in the newly designated nation's capital in  October 1792 , a year after President George Washington selected the site himself. The neoclassical building was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban and constructed by a team of  enslaved and freed Black Americans  and European immigrants over the course of eight years. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, were the first to inhabit the residence, which was  still unfinished  by the time they moved in toward the end of his term in November 1800. President Thomas Jefferson moved in the following year and went on to decorate the \"president's house\" with  furnishings he had inherited  from all of his presidential predecessors. But almost all of it was lost in 1814, when British troops  set fire to the building  during the War of 1812. President James Madison and first lady Dolley Madison both  fled Washington, D.C., to safety , the latter managing to  bring a full-size portrait of former President George Washington  with her. Both returned to a temporary residence to finish out his presidency. Hoban oversaw the rebuilding of the White House. Its second incarnation, which closely resembled the first, officially reopened with President James Monroe's arrival in 1817. Monroe later tasked Hoban with the building's first major addition,  the South Portico  — the iconic rounded entrance lined with Ionic columns — was completed in 1824. Construction of the  North Portico  was completed in 1830, under President Andrew Jackson. Early 20th century: The creation and expansion of the West Wing The next big changes happened under President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1901,  he renamed it  the \"White House\" in all formal communications, making its  longtime nickname  official. (It was originally called the \"president's house\" or \"executive mansion\", but most people started referring to it by its limestone white-wash coloring in the early 1800s.) In 1902, Roosevelt began a major renovation of the physical building that \"transformed it from a crazy quilt of alterations over time into a cohesive statement of modern times,\" the late author and historian  William Seale wrote . The biggest change was the relocation of his office from the second floor to the West Wing, originally called the Executive Office Building. The separate, one-story structure was accessible by walkway and housed the offices of presidential staff and secretaries as well as a Cabinet meeting room. The project expanded the first family's living quarters (necessary, since the Roosevelts had six young kids) and modernized the building's heating and plumbing systems. It also created the East Terrace — a new entryway for guests that would later become the East Wing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Subsequent presidents continued to build on Roosevelt's renovations. President William Taft remodeled and expanded the West Wing in 1909 to create the Oval Office. President Calvin Coolidge  had the roof rebuilt  and a third floor added in 1927, after an engineering report showed that the roof trusses were weakened and unsafe. The  West Wing was remodeled  after a 1929 fire and further  expanded in 1934 , when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt relocated the Oval Office to its current location for more privacy, built more offices underground and installed an  indoor swimming pool  for his polio therapy (financed by private donations). Mid-20th century: Controversial additions and a major renovation FDR also had the East Wing created in 1942, primarily to cover up  an underground bunker  and to house more staff and offices during the war. According to the  White House Historical Association , the wartime construction of the East Wing was highly controversial. Republicans criticized it as wasteful and accused Roosevelt of \"using the project to bolster his presidency's image.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The secretive nature of the construction, tied to military purposes, further fueled suspicions,\" wrote association president Stewart McLaurin. \"However, the East Wing's utility in supporting the modern presidency eventually quieted critics.\" The next major renovation, and perhaps the biggest one, happened under President Harry Truman in the late 1940s. In response to structural deficiencies, his architects decided to gut the entire interior, leaving only the exterior walls intact, between 1948 and 1952. The project cost the equivalent of $60 million —  funded and authorized  by Congress — and drew intense scrutiny from preservationists and the public. One of the most controversial changes was the addition of a balcony to the second floor of the South Portico. While opposed by some architectural purists and Truman's opponents in Congress for both aesthetic and financial reasons, the Truman Balcony has become a hallmark of both first family leisure and official White House events ( think: Easter Egg roll ). \"The Truman Balcony was something that was really controversial at the time, and now it's one of the most beloved parts of the White House for the president and their family to be sitting outside looking out on the South Lawn,\" Kate Andersen Brower, author of  The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House ,  told NPR 's  Here & Now. Truman  funded the balcony  himself, using money from his allocated household account. Brower said Trump's ballroom is the biggest renovation since then — but is different in key ways. \"[Truman] wasn't going to take no for an answer, but he did go through the channels to get approval for this renovation. And we're not seeing President Trump do the same thing,\" she added. Late 20th century onward: Presidents personalize the grounds  Recent decades have seen frequent but relatively minor changes to White House grounds. President John F. Kennedy created the  modern Rose Garden  in 1963 — and it remained relatively unchanged until this August, when  Trump had it paved over  and turned into a patio. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon  converted the indoor swimming pool  into the White House Press Room and installed a  one-lane bowling alley , while President Gerald Ford had a swimming pool (also privately funded)  built outdoors . In the early 2000s, President George W.  Bush modernized  the press briefing room and the Situation Room and installed the first-ever  solar electric system  on White House grounds (President  Jimmy Carter  first installed solar heating panels on the White House roof in 1979, but they were removed in the 1980s). President Barack Obama  adapted a tennis court  so it could also be used for basketball, and First Lady Michelle Obama planted the  White House Kitchen Garden  on the South Lawn. Trump has changed the grounds already Trump himself has made a slew of renovations since his second term began in January, and not just to the Rose Garden. He's also bedecked the  Oval Office with gilded frames  and golden details, and added a  Presidential Walk of Fame  to the walkway between the West Wing and executive residence. It features portraits of every previous president except for President Joe Biden. Instead of a headshot, Biden's frame features a picture  of an autopen , which Trump has repeatedly accused him of using (despite the fact that the practice is not prohibited). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The White House says Trump is carrying on a \"proud presidential legacy\" of making upgrades to the building, in this case increasing its capacity to host major functions. The East Room currently seats about 200 people for dinner, meaning many large White House events are hosted outside in fancy tents with floors and chandeliers. Brower, the author, says there is a case to be made for expanding the entertaining space at the White House, with caveats: \"I don't think that it has to be of this size and scope, two football fields big and larger than the White House itself.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cartels-drug-boat-strike-ffb1b720fa018336316238463924b78a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:43:04+00:00","title":"U.S. Launches Ninth Strike Against Drug Vessel in Eastern Pacific, Expanding War on South American Cartels","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military launched its ninth strike against a drug-carrying vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing three people, as part of a broader campaign under President Donald Trump to combat drug trafficking in South America.

ninth  strike against an alleged drug-carrying vessel , killing three people in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, expanding the Trump administration’s  campaign against drug trafficking in South America . It followed another strike Tuesday night, also in the eastern Pacific, that killed two people, Hegseth posted on social media hours earlier. The attacks were departures from the seven previous U.S. strikes that  had targeted vessels  in the Caribbean Sea. They bring the death toll to at least 37 from attacks that began last month. The strikes represent an expansion of the military’s targeting area as well as a shift to the waters off South America where much of the cocaine from the world’s largest producers is smuggled. Hegseth’s social media posts also drew a  direct comparison between the war on terrorism  that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration’s crackdown. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding “there will be no refuge or forgiveness — only justice.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 China and the United States, Fall 2025: A timeline of remarks, threats, critiques — and dialogue \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump issues disaster declarations for Alaska and other states but denies Illinois and Maryland \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 How Trump and Xi are doing a delicate, sometimes pointed dance in bilateral trade talks \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Later Wednesday, he referred to the alleged drug-runners as “the ‘Al Qaeda’ of our hemisphere.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Republican President Donald Trump has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in  an “armed conflict” with drug cartels  and proclaiming the criminal organizations unlawful combatants, relying on the same legal authority used by President George W.

We’re allowed to do that.” He said similar strikes could eventually come on land. “We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “We’re totally prepared to do that. And we’ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we’re doing when we come to the land.” Lawmakers from both political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details.  Appearing alongside Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended such strikes, saying, “If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump said the strikes he is ordering are meant to save Americans and “the only way you can’t feel bad about it ... is that you realize that every time you see that happen, you’re saving 25,000 lives.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen as Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025, in Washington.

Several seconds into the video, the boat explodes and is seen floating motionless on the water in flames. The second video shows another boat moving quickly before being struck by an explosion. Video apparently recorded after the explosion shows packages floating in the water. The U.S. military has built up an unusually large  force in the Caribbean Sea  and the waters off the coast of Venezuela since this summer, raising speculation that Trump  could try to topple  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Maduro faces  charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S. In his posts on the strikes, Trump has repeatedly argued that illegal narcotics and the drug fentanyl carried by the vessels have been poisoning Americans. While the bulk of American overdose deaths are from fentanyl, the drug is transported by land from Mexico. Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, but the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean, is the primary area for smuggling cocaine. Colombia  and Peru, countries with coastlines on the eastern Pacific, are the world’s top cocaine producers.  Wedged between them is Ecuador , whose world-class ports and myriad maritime shipping containers filled with bananas have become the perfect vehicle for drug traffickers to move their product. The administration has  sidestepped prosecuting any occupants  of alleged drug-running vessels after returning two survivors of an earlier strike to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ecuadorian officials later said  they released the man who was returned because they had no evidence he committed a crime in their country. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listens as President Donald Trump speaks before a lunch with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Washington.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was alarmed and angry about a lack of information on the strikes. “Expanding the geography simply expands the lawlessness and the recklessness in the use of the American military without seeming legal or practical justification,” Blumenthal said. He said the way to target trafficking would be stopping the boats and interrogating those aboard to find the source of the drugs, “not just destroy the smugglers who are likely to be at the bottom of the smuggling chain.” The Republican-controlled Senate recently  voted down  a Democratic-sponsored  war powers  resolution, mostly along party lines, that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes. Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he’s met with Rubio. “He has researched the legal ramifications carefully and he believes we’re on solid ground in attacking these narcoterrorists,” Kennedy said. “I trust his judgment.” ___ Associated Press writers Will Weissert and Kevin Freking in Washington and Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/federal-immigration-enforcement-san-francisco-e6729ae2d696cdc881003efa1966a3d2","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:19:08+00:00","title":"Trump Backs Off San Francisco Federal Deployment After Mayor’s Appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed plans to deploy federal agents, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel, into San Francisco after speaking with Mayor Daniel Lurie, who reported progress in reducing city crime.

(AP) — President  Donald Trump  said Thursday that he’s backing off a planned surge of  federal agents into San Francisco  after speaking to the mayor, as protesters gathered outside a U.S. Coast Guard base where they were located.  Trump posted on social media that Mayor Daniel Lurie told him Wednesday night that the city was making progress in reducing crime. Trump said he agreed to let San Francisco keep trying on its own. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving Thursday at  Coast Guard Island in Alameda, California,  to support federal efforts to track down immigrants in the country illegally. Several hundred people, many singing hymns and carrying signs saying, “Protect our neighbors” and “No ICE or troops in the Bay,” referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, gathered at the base around dawn.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Police used at least one flash-bang grenade to clear a handful of demonstrators from the entrance as CBP vehicles drove onto the base.

Gavin Newsom’s office said on X: “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason — and heard what we have been saying from the beginning. The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we’ve done.” The San Francisco Chronicle , citing an anonymous source with knowledge of the operation, reported Wednesday that more than 100 CBP and other federal agents would arrive this week. Lurie and Newsom, both Democrats, condemned the move, saying it was meant to provoke violent protests. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to deploy National Guard troops to San Francisco  to quell crime , but his administration hasn’t offered a timeline for doing so. His assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 have baffled local and state leaders, who point to statistics showing that many crimes are at record lows. Trump has deployed the Guard to  Washington, D.C. , and  Memphis ,  Tennessee , to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}(); \n\n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n\n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He has also said they are needed in  Chicago  and  Portland , Oregon.

Coast Guard Island is an artificial island formed in 1913, and the Coast Guard first established a base there in 1926. The island is owned by the federal government and is not open to the general public, so escorts or specific government ID cards are required for visitors. The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which also houses ICE and CBP. ___ Weber reported from Los Angeles.

The Seattle-based Basel Action Network, or BAN, said a two-year investigation found at least 10 U.S. companies exporting used electronics to Asia and the Middle East, in what it says is a “hidden tsunami” of electronic waste. “This new, almost invisible tsunami of e-waste, is taking place ... padding already lucrative profit margins of the electronics recycling sector while allowing a major portion of the American public’s and corporate IT equipment to be surreptitiously exported to and processed under harmful conditions in Southeast Asia,” the report said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Growing e-waste Electronic waste, or e-waste, includes discarded devices like phones and computers containing both valuable materials and toxic metals like lead, cadmium and mercury. As gadgets are replaced faster, global e-waste is growing five times quicker than it’s formally recycled. The world produced a record 62 million metric tons in 2022. That’s  expected to climb  to 82 million by 2030, according to the United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union and its research arm, UNITAR.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Toxic chemicals That American e-waste adds to the burden for Asia, which already produces nearly half the world’s total. Much of it is dumped in landfills, leaching toxic chemicals into the environment. Some ends up in  informal scrapyards , where workers burn or dismantle devices by hand, often without protection, releasing toxic fumes and scrap. About 2,000 containers — roughly 33,000 metric tons (36,376 U.S. tons) — of used electronics leave U.S. ports every month, according to the report. It said the companies behind the shipments, described as “e-waste brokers,” typically don’t recycle the waste themselves but send it to companies in developing countries. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Response to the report The companies identified in the report include Attan Recycling, Corporate eWaste Solutions or CEWS, Creative Metals Group, EDM, First America Metal Corp., GEM Iron and Metal Inc., Greenland Resource, IQA Metals, PPM Recycling and Semsotai. Six of the companies didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. Semsotai told The Associated Press that it doesn’t export scrap, only working components for reuse. It accused BAN of bias.  PPM Recycling told The Associated Press that its warehouses in California and Texas ship only aluminum and other non-iron metals to Malaysia. It said BAN had exaggerated shipment volumes, adding that it used accurate trade codes and followed U.S. and international rules. Greenland Resource told The Associated Press it took the allegations seriously and was reviewing the matter internally and couldn’t comment further without seeing the report. CEWS said it follows strict environmental standards, but some aspects of where and how recycled materials are handled are industrial secrets. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Value of more than $1 billion The report estimated that between January 2023 and February 2025, the 10 companies exported more than 10,000 containers of potential e-waste valued at over $1 billion, the report said. Industrywide, such trade could top $200 million a month.  Eight of the 10 identified companies hold R2V3 certifications — an industry standard meant to ensure electronics are recycled safely and responsibly, raising questions about the value of such a certification, the report said.  Several companies operate out of California, despite the state’s strict e-waste laws requiring full reporting and proper downstream handling of electronic and universal waste. International treaty Many e-waste containers go to countries that have banned such imports under the Basel Convention, which is an international treaty that bars hazardous waste trade from non-signatories like the U.S., the only industrialized nation yet to ratify it. The nonprofit said its review of government and private trade records from ships and customs officials showed shipments were often declared under trade codes that did not match those for electronic waste, such as “commodity materials” like raw metals or other recyclable goods to evade detection. Such classifications were “highly unlikely” given how the companies publicly describe their operations, the report said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Landfills and pollution Tony R. Walker, who studies global waste trade at the Dalhousie University’s School for Resource and Environmental Studies in Halifax in Canada, said he wasn’t surprised that e-waste continues to evade regulation. While some devices can be legally traded if functional, most such exports to developing nations are broken or obsolete and mislabeled, bound for landfills that pollute the environment and have little market value, he said. He pointed to Malaysia — a Basel Convention signatory identified in the report as the primary destination for U.S. e-waste — saying the country would be overwhelmed by that volume, in addition to waste from other wealthy nations. “It simply means the country is being overwhelmed with what is essentially pollution transfer from other nations,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n ‘Mecca of junk’ The report estimates that U.S. e-waste shipments may have made up about 6% of all U.S. exports to the country from 2023 to 2025. After China banned imports of foreign waste in 2017, many Chinese businesses shifted their operations to Southeast Asia, using family and business ties to secure permits.  “Malaysia suddenly became this mecca of junk,” said Jim Puckett of the Basel Action Network.  Containers were also sent to Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and the UAE, despite bans under the Basel Convention and national laws, the report added. In countries receiving this U.S. e-waste, “undocumented workers desperate for jobs” toil in makeshift facilities, inhaling toxic fumes as they strip wires, melt plastics and dismantle devices without protection, the report said. Efforts to control illegal imports Authorities in Thailand and Malaysia have stepped up efforts to curb illegal imports of U.S. e-waste.  In May, Thai authorities  seized 238 tons of U.S. e-waste  at Bangkok’s port seized 238 tons of U.S. scrap at Bangkok’s port while Malaysian authorities confiscated e-waste worth $118 million in nationwide raids in June.  Most of the facilities in Malaysia were illegal and lacked environmental safeguards, said SiPeng Wong, of Malaysia’s Center to Combat Corruption & Cronyism. Exporting e-waste from rich nations to developing nations strains local facilities, overwhelms efforts to manage domestic waste and is a form of “waste colonialism,” she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that one of the companies identified in the report is called First America Metal Corp., not First American Metals."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-investigations-justice-department-payment-a16d573fc417592d5cefebbd2847094f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:28:46+00:00","title":"Trump Suggests He’s Entitled to Compensation from Federal Government Over Past Investigations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has filed two administrative claims with the Justice Department seeking $230 million in damages, citing politically motivated investigations into his conduct, including the 2022 FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property and the Trump-Russia investigation.

government over investigations he faced that  he claims were politically motivated . Now, the Justice Department that Trump has exerted control over could approve a hefty payout in taxpayer dollars.  The Republican president’s comments in the Oval Office on Tuesday have put a spotlight on a law through which people can seek damages if they believe they were wronged by the federal government.  But the potential that the president might take taxpayer money from the same government he leads has raised numerous ethical questions, especially since Trump has made cutting federal spending a top administration priority.  Adding to conflict-of-interest concerns is the fact that top Justice Department officials who would presumably have to sign off on such a settlement previously served as a defense lawyer for the president or his close allies. Here’s a look at Trump’s claims and the process that could play out:  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump says he’d have final say on money he seeks over past federal investigations into his conduct \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 House Republicans preparing report on Biden’s use of autopen after months of investigation \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Appellate judges question moves to keep Alina Habba in place as top New Jersey prosecutor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n How the claims process works  Before reclaiming the White House, Trump filed two claims with the Justice Department seeking $230 million in damages related to the FBI’s 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property for classified documents and for a separate investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign, The New York Times reported Tuesday.  He filed the claims in 2023 and 2024 under a law that permits individuals to sue federal agencies, like the Justice Department, if they believe they’ve been harmed by employees of those agencies acting within the scope of their duties. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, individuals must first file an administrative claim with the government agency. The agency then has six months to either settle the claim or deny it outright.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n If the agency denies the claim or doesn’t act on it within that time frame, the person can then file a federal lawsuit. Trump has not yet filed a lawsuit on either claim, even though six months have passed.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The usual source of payments for claims against the government is from what’s known as the Judgment Fund. Treasury Department records show payments from the Judgment Fund over the last year on behalf of a slew of federal agencies related to discrimination claims, violations of the Privacy Act and other matters.  In one recent high-profile case, the Justice Department  in 2024 agreed to pay more than $138 million  to settle 139 administrative claims brought by people who accused the FBI of grossly mishandling allegations of sexual assault against Larry Nassar in 2015 and 2016. Why Trump says the government owes him money  Trump has long claimed he was the victim of a weaponized Justice Department that targeted him for political purposes. The Biden administration’s Justice Department abandoned both criminal cases it brought against Trump after his White House victory last November because of department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. The president signaled his interest in compensation during a White House appearance last week with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi — telling reporters “I’m suing myself” — even though his claims to date have not been filed as lawsuits. He said he believes the government owes him a “lot of money,” but suggested he could donate any taxpayer money or use it to help pay for a ballroom he’s building at the White House. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n One of the administrative claims, filed in August 2024 and reviewed by The Associated Press, seeks $115 million in compensatory and punitive damages over the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate and the resulting case alleging he hoarded classified documents and thwarted government efforts to retrieve them. It accuses former Attorney General Merrick Garland, former FBI Director Christopher Wray and Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith of harassing and targeting Trump with a “malicious prosecution” in an effort to hurt Trump’s bid to reclaim the White House.  The Times said the other claim seeks damages related to the long-concluded Trump-Russia investigation, which continues to infuriate the president. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Defense lawyers for Trump and his allies could have the final say  Trump’s claims have raised thorny ethical issues because under Justice Department policy, proposed settlements of more than $4 million must be approved by the deputy attorney general or associate attorney general. Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was one of Trump’s lead defense lawyers in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. And Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward represented Trump’s  valet and co-defendant, Walt Nauta,  in the same case. The department has not said whether Blanche and Woodward would be recused in settlement talks, but said in a statement on Tuesday that “in any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.” Bondi, in July, however, fired the department’s top official responsible for advising the attorney general and deputy attorney general on ethics issues.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Democrats plan to investigate Democrats pounced on the news, announcing that Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, would launch an investigation into what they called a “shakedown” that violated the Constitution. It was not immediately clear what shape that inquiry might take, but it seems unlikely that Raskin or other Democrats will get any cooperation from Justice Department leadership, particularly in the aftermath of a combative congressional appearance that Bondi made earlier this month."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/peru-emergency-decree-president-jeri-crime-d988135d756492ee8110deacc8ed1ed6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"21:05:20Z","title":"Peru Declares State of Emergency Amid Rising Crime and Public Skepticism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Peru’s newly elected President José Jerí declared a state of emergency in October 2025, following the removal of former President Dina Boluarte, who was criticized for failing to control rising crime.

of Peru’s capital saw more soldiers and police patrolling the streets on Wednesday, the first day of a  state of emergency  decreed by newly sworn in  President José Jerí  in an effort to reign in crime. The sweeping decree suspended several constitutional rights — including freedom of assembly and protest — while banning everyday activities such as two adults riding on motorcycle. It also limited visits to prisoners and allowed power cuts to prison cells except for lighting. Jerí assumed the presidency on Oct. 10 after  lawmakers removed then President Dina Boluarte  from office in part over her inability to curb rising crime across the South American country. He declared the state of emergency a week after a massive protest demanding his resignation turned violent, with one protester killed by police and another civilian suffering a severe skull fracture. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Peruvians, however, expressed skepticism over Jerí’s decree as similar measures enacted by Boluarte proved ineffective. “There have already been several states of emergency, the extortions continue, the murders do not stop,” Manuel Timoteo said as he waited for a bus in northern Lima. “The soldiers go out for a few days, stand with their rifles on a corner, leave and everything remains the same.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Brazilian President Lula announces reelection bid for fourth nonconsecutive term \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Tropical Storm Melissa lumbers through the Caribbean, killing an elderly man in Haiti \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Carrascal’s late goal lifts Flamengo over Racing Club in Copa Libertadores semifinals \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Boluarte’s government declared a state of emergency in March, which was extended until May.

Police initially gave the death toll as 63 in a statement sent to reporters, but later revised it to 46, saying in another statement that some people found unconscious at the crash scene were actually still alive. “At the time of the crash, several victims were found unconscious, and some may have been mistakenly included in the initial fatality count,” the statement said.  Several others were injured in the crash that happened after midnight local time on the highway to Gulu, a major city in northern Uganda.

While accident victims can expect to get help from onlookers and other first responders who rush to crash sites, “at night even bystanders are not there,” she said.  Most of the injured people are receiving treatment at a government hospital nearby.  In Uganda, 5,144 people were killed in road crashes in 2024. That number rose from 4,806 in 2023 and 4,534 in 2022, according to official police figures, which show a worrisome rise in the total number of those killed or injured in road crashes in recent years.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Careless overtaking and speeding accounted for 44.5% of all crashes documented in 2024, the police’s latest crime report said.  “As investigations continue, we strongly urge all motorists to exercise maximum caution on the roads, especially avoiding dangerous and careless overtaking, which remains one of the leading causes of crashes in the country,” the police said in their statement after the latest crash.  In addition to reckless driving and bad infrastructure, there is poor enforcement of traffic rules especially for heavy vehicles moving at night, said Joseph Beyanga, a road safety campaigner who for years has been trying to raise awareness about road carnage in Uganda.  He told The Associated Press that the crash in Kiryandongo showed he and others have more work to do. “These crashes are just a cruel reminder that we still have a long way to go,” he said. “On the government side, there is total absence of enforcement. What’s happening on the roads is anarchy.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Beyanga, campaigning as Joe Walker, organizes regular walks from Kampala, the Ugandan capital, into the countryside that are often attended by hundreds of followers.  His next event, planned for November, will be a memorial walk of more than 60 kilometers (37 miles) in memory of hundreds of thousands killed or maimed in road crashes over the years, he said. ____ AP’s Africa coverage at:  https://apnews.com/hub/africa ____ This story has been updated to revise the police’s account of the death toll from 63 to 46.

Russian former world champion who persistently leveled unproven cheating allegations at  Daniel Naroditsky  in the year leading up to the American grandmaster’s death. The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced  his death  Monday. He was 29. The cause of death has not been made public. Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online  chess  last October. He continued to share his suspicions on social media over the past year without providing substantial evidence.

Five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen called Kramnik’s relentless pursuit of Naroditsky “appalling.” During his last livestream Saturday, Naroditsky told his massive online following that Kramnik’s cheating claims had taken a toll on him.  “Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,” Naroditsky said, adding that Kramnik used to be one of his “heroes.” A history of cheating claims It’s not the first time Kramnik has been accused of harassment. The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik’s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless allegations about “many dozens of players.” The following year, Kramnik published a list of players on social media with the title “Cheating Tuesdays” that included Czech grandmaster David Navara. Navara later shared on his blog that Kramnik’s public accusations had pushed him to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In June, the federation responded to the players’ public spat, saying the way Kramnik presents his arguments “brings a lot of harm to the chess community,” and “could be ruinous for the careers and well-being of certain players.” The group invited Kramnik to present the details of his approach and statistical data for official evaluation. Kramnik’s anti-cheating crusade exploded with the game’s shift online during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many elite players traded the physical chess board for a keyboard to continue playing through lockdown, creating a surge in popularity for streaming content and fast-paced online games in which Naroditsky excelled.  Players of the cerebral sport are known to value respectful conduct over the board. But in the digital arena, a new level of toxicity has developed, with cheating allegations growing rampant and becoming much more difficult to prove. Players now have sophisticated computer schemes at their fingertips that could give them an unfair advantage, and new ways to profit off their success online. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Naroditsky’s impact on the speed game In blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches, experts say top talents often move with speed and precision on par with a computer. Naroditsky was among the world’s top 25 blitz players and won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich acknowledged Wednesday. “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Dvorkovich said the federation will establish a prize in Naroditsky’s memory.  Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause. Kramnik wrote on the social platform X that the death “should be investigated by police.” He wrote Wednesday that he received threats after revealing “public information about the ‘dark side’ of modern chess.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/giants-manager-vitello-tennessee-baseball-c6dc9add3e3f8ecb551f80946aa06939","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:57:16+00:00","title":"San Francisco Giants Hire College Coach Tony Vitello as First-Time Manager","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The San Francisco Giants have made a bold move by hiring Tony Vitello, a college baseball coach with no prior professional experience, as their new manager.

San Francisco president of baseball operations Buster Posey made an unprecedented gamble on a coach with no previous experience in the pros. The 47-year-old Vitello will make the jump after spending his entire career in the college ranks. “Tony is one of the brightest, most innovative and most respected coaches in college baseball today,” Posey said. “Throughout our search, Tony’s leadership, competitiveness and commitment to developing players stood out.” Posey said the Giants look forward to the energy and direction Vitello brings, given that his passion for baseball aligns with the club’s values. “I’m incredibly honored and grateful for this opportunity,” Vitello said in the Giants’ announcement. “I’m excited to lead this group of players and represent the San Francisco Giants.

Posey had also considered his former backup catcher Nick Hundley, who has been working as a special assistant to Texas Rangers general manager Chris Young. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Instead, Posey is taking a route once tapped by the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys with Miami Hurricanes coach Jimmy Johnson in 1989. That worked out with Johnson winning two Super Bowl championships in 1992 and 1993 during a Hall of Fame career. Posey is striving for stability at manager after so much turnover for the franchise in recent years, including Posey taking over as president of baseball operations last fall when Farhan Zaidi was fired. The Giants dismissed manager Bob Melvin  after two years, and Posey quickly ruled out longtime Giants skipper Bruce Bochy as an option to replace him once Bochy parted ways with Texas following a three-year managerial stint. San Francisco finished 81-81 for one more victory than in Melvin’s first year. They haven’t reached the postseason since winning the NL West with a franchise-record 107 victories to edge the rival Dodgers by one game in 2021 under skipper Gabe Kapler. Longtime executive Harry Dalton thought the jump to MLB manager would be too big at once, so he hired Arizona State coach Bobby Winkles as a coach on the Angels’ staff for the 1972 season under Del Rice. Winkles then replaced Rice as manager in 1973. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Two Hall of Famers who managed in the big leagues were college coaches. Hughie Jennings was player-coach at St. Bonaventure from 1894-97, then managed the Detroit Tigers from 1907-20 and the Giants in 1924-25. Casey Stengel coached the University of Mississippi in 1914 before being hired for his first big league managing job with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1934. In Vitello, the Giants will have a colorful and brash manager. The NCAA suspended Vitello twice during his Tennessee tenure, first for spending too much time arguing a call in 2018. During that two-game suspension, he raised money for charity with a  pizza and lemonade stand  while the Vols played. Chest-bumping an umpire  in 2022 led to a four-game suspension, and Vitello spent that time working with a  Tennessee fraternity  offering a  chest bump  to anyone donating $2 to the Wounded Warriors Project. Vitello is no stranger to Northern California. In 2002, he was associate head coach of the Salinas Packers in the California Collegiate League. The team went 50-14 and reached the National Baseball Congress World Series in Wichita, Kansas. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He played three seasons at Missouri as an infielder and began his coaching career there before stints with TCU and Arkansas, the latter as hitting coach. A native of St. Louis, Vitello went 341–131 at Tennessee. In his second season in 2019, he led the Vols to their first NCAA berth since 2005. Vitello then led the Vols to their first national title in baseball, winning the 2024 College World Series. Tennessee has reached the College World Series three times with Vitello. He has two SEC regular-season titles and a pair of SEC Tournament titles, the last in 2024. Tennessee is finishing up an expansion and renovation of its baseball stadium to meet interest in the program. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Vitello was earning $3 million a year and signed a  five-year extension in 2024  that includes a $3 million buyout. Tennessee athletic director Danny White congratulated Vitello on the job and said university officials were focused on players and the coaching staff in an “evolving process” while they finalize the next steps to replace him. “We are committed to continuously investing in the program at a championship level across all areas,” White said. “Furthermore, the upcoming $109 million renovation of Lindsey Nelson Stadium will transform it into one of the premier baseball venues.” ___ AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum and AP Sports Writer Teresa M.

Massey, who had mental health problems, had called 911 about a suspected prowler.  “She’s a little scattered, but she’s nice and kind and talking to him and you’ll see that interaction,” Milhiser said during opening statements. “You will see what happens when the defendant gets mad at a woman who is in her kitchen and has called for help. He gets mad and shoots and kills her without lawful justification.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the murder trial of an Illinois sheriff deputy who killed Sonya Massey \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Sonya Massey shooting prompts Illinois law requiring disclosure of police recruits’ backgrounds \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “He did not follow his training.

Farley said that after Grayson was indicted he sought to amend his statement to the Illinois State Police to “clarify” that it was Grayson’s response, not the hot water, that rattled him and that it was an oven mitt, not the pot, that Massey held chest-high. At the time, Farley was serving a one-year probationary period and subject to firing for any reason. He said his union representative advised against further state police contact. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Earlier, Illinois State Police Lt.

Wolff sought unspecified damages in the lawsuit filed Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Nicholas Clemens, a spokesperson for Melania Trump, issued a statement, saying: “First Lady Melania Trump is proud to continue standing up to those who spread malicious and defamatory falsehoods as they desperately try to get undeserved attention and money from their unlawful conduct.” In his lawsuit, Wolff said Melania Trump and her husband,  President Donald Trump , “have made a practice of threatening those who speak against them” with costly legal actions “to silence their speech, to intimidate their critics generally, and to extract unjustified payments and North Korean style confessions and apologies.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He said the threats “are designed to create a climate of fear in the nation so that people cannot freely or confidently exercise their First Amendment rights.” According to the lawsuit, the threats are also meant to shut down inquiry into the couple’s involvement with  Epstein , the notorious financier who killed himself in a New York federal jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Melania Trump demands Hunter Biden retract ‘extremely salacious’ Epstein comments \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The lawsuit came on the day that Melania Trump’s lawyer had set as a deadline for Wolff to retract statements, issue an apology and pay damages to his client. \n    \n     ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n The lawyer, Alejandro Brito, wrote on Oct. 15 that she would be “left with no alternative” but to sue for over $1 billion after the statements had caused her “overwhelming reputational and financial harm.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Through his lawsuit, Wolff announced his intention to use the legal action to put the president and his wife under oath to answer questions about Epstein.

Others, the lawsuit said, were protected speech. For instance, the statement that the Trumps were in a “sham marriage, trophy marriage,” was a “fair and justified” statement of opinion, it said. The lawsuit noted that Wolff never said Melania Trump was involved in any of Epstein’s crimes. Among the statements the lawsuit said were true were those saying Melania Trump was “very involved” in Epstein’s social circle, where she met her future husband, and that Donald Trump liked to have sex with his friend’s wives and first slept with Melania Trump on Epstein’s private jet. The lawsuit said it was fair to question how Melania Trump fits into the Epstein story. And, it added, it was proper to “find out what happened in Mr. Trump’s and Epstein’s 10 years of pursuing models, including supermodels, runway models, catalog models, Eastern European models, and girls who just dreamed of being models.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n According to the lawsuit, that subject “will be one of the zones of inquiry that this lawsuit will have to undertake.” Wolff conducted interviews with Epstein before his death. Earlier this year, President Trump berated Wolff as a “Third Rate Reporter” and, in one lengthy social media post, called his upcoming book “a total FAKE JOB, just like the other JUNK he wrote.” Trump added: “His other books about me have been discredited, as this one will be also.” ___ Associated Press Writer Jennifer Peltz contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-san-francisco-immigration-904c9e47637ef9e9ed6241acd03dd998","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"01:26:25+00:00","title":"Coast Guard Deploys CBP Agents in San Francisco Bay Area Amid Political and Legal Pushback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Coast Guard has established a base in Alameda, California, to support over 100 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in their efforts to detect and interdict illegal immigration and criminal activity.

Customs and Border Protection agents in the San Francisco area as part of its effort to support federal efforts to track down immigrants in the country illegally and provide border and maritime security. The San Francisco Chronicle,  citing an anonymous source with knowledge of the operation, reported more than 100 CBP and other federal agents will begin arriving Thursday at the base in Alameda, a move immediately condemned by San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The two Democrats said the surge is meant to provoke violent protests. CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. A statement provided to media by the Coast Guard said in part that “through a whole of government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Soon after the deployment was first reported, Lurie livestreamed a nine-minute statement from City Hall, flanked by other elected officials, and cautioned against giving federal officials working from “a playbook” any excuse to crack down.

Newsom’s administration said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the guard into Los Angeles against the governor’s wishes.

A Homeland Security statement said the agency is “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.” Lurie urged the public to protest peacefully. He said he had just signed an executive directive to coordinate the city’s response to a potential federal deployment and provide support for immigrants.

Andrew Cuomo was pressed on the sexual harassment allegations that drove him from office in a contentious final debate in New York City’s mayoral race. While Mamdani, the frontrunner, began by accusing his rivals of being consumed by fighting — suggesting he would try to focus instead on his vision for New Yorkers — the state assemblymember joined them in mud as he tried to create viral social media moments, included inviting one of Cuomo’s accusers to appear in the audience. Cuomo, running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, fared better Wednesday than during their first debate.

You’ve never accomplished anything,” he said, insisting Mamdani lacks the merit and qualifications to run the nation’s biggest city or handle its emergencies. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Sliwa accused both men of “fighting like kids in a school yard,” but piled on as well. “Zorhan, your resume could fit on a cocktail napkin.

He also made frequent references to Cuomo’s decision to resign as governor amid a barrage of sexual harassment allegations, which Cuomo denies. Local issues and the Canal Street raid  While the race has often been dominated by questions about the Israel-Hamas war, Trump and other national subjects, the candidates Wednesday were peppered for specifics about crime, the subways and the notorious Rikers Island jail complex. Mamdani came under fire after he declined to take a position on a set of initiatives that will appear on the November ballot. Mamdani also said as mayor he would ask New York City’s police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to remain in her post. Mamdani, who was deeply critical of the city’s police in the past, has been trying to moderate his most contentious positions.  The candidates also railed against this week’s immigration enforcement sweep  targeting vendors on Manhattan’s famed Canal Street  that led to 14 arrests. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cuomo said the city does not need Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the city to handle quality-of-life crimes like dealing in counterfeit bags.

Cuomo spoke repeatedly about how he had held Trump at bay during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and said a Mamdani win would be a “dream” for the president. “He has said he’ll take over New York if Mamdani wins, and he will! Because, he has no respect for him. He thinks he’s a kid and he’s going to kick him on his tuchus,” Cuomo said. Mamdani, meanwhile, tried to depict Cuomo as Trump’s “puppet” and too aligned with the president. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “He wants Andrew Cuomo to be the mayor not because it will be good for New Yorkers, but because it will be good for him,” Mamdani said.

Mamdani pulls from Trump’s playbook Cuomo, meanwhile, continued to be dogged by the allegations that forced his resignation. Mamdani said one of the women who had accused Cuomo of sexual harassment, his former aide Charlotte Bennett, was in the audience Wednesday. Trump used  a similar strategy in 2016  when he appeared at a debate with accusers of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, who has denied the accusations against him. “What do you say to the 13 women that you sexually harassed?” he asked as he pressed Cuomo on the allegations and the millions in taxpayer dollars that were spent to defend him in court. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cuomo denied wrongdoing and chided Mamdani. “If you want to be in government, then you have to be serious and mature,” he said. Bennett was the second woman to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment, alleging he subjected her to invasive questions about her personal life and sexual relationships. Cuomo denies Bennett’s allegations. Several candidates noted at the start of the debate that New Yorkers would probably rather be watching the Knicks opening game of the season, which tipped off at the same time.

People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain  immunotherapy drugs  lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. And it had nothing to do with virus infections. Instead,  the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA , appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida.

But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack.  Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak . It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the  Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines , scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.” Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer. Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too. So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t. Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said. —- The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

paratrooper was found not guilty Thursday on murder charges relating to the  1972 Bloody Sunday  massacre in Northern Ireland that saw 13 people killed in a flurry of bullets. Judge Patrick Lynch ruled at Belfast Crown Court that prosecutors failed to prove that the veteran identified only as “Soldier F” had opened fire, with intent to kill, on unarmed civilians who were running to safety. Soldier F was the only soldier ever charged in connection with the events on Jan. 20, 1972 in Londonderry, also known as Derry. It was one of the deadliest incidents of the period known as “The Troubles,” the conflict between mainly Catholic supporters of a united Ireland and predominantly Protestant forces who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. In addition to the 13 killed, 15 others were wounded on Bloody Sunday. Survivors have spoken of the confusion, chaos and terror as soldiers opened fire and bodies began falling after a large civil rights march through the city.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The verdict was a blow to families of victims who have spent more than a half-century seeking justice. While the sectarian violence largely ended with the  1998 Good Friday peace accord  and Northern Ireland has become a beacon of hope for other conflicts around the world, tensions remain. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The verdict in detail Soldier F was shrouded from view in court by a curtain throughout the five-week trial, and did not testify in his defense. It was a nonjury trial, as has been the standard in cases related to the decades-long period of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.  He had pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder for the deaths of James Wray, 22, and William McKinney, 27, and five counts of attempted murder for the shootings of Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon, Patrick O’Donnell, and for opening fire at fleeing demonstrators. The judge said the evidence presented against the veteran fell well short of what was required for conviction. But he berated the soldiers from the Parachute Regiment on duty that day for the way they responded, and how their actions sullied the memory of a unit that had a proud record in World War II. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “They had totally lost all sense of military discipline,” he said. “Shooting in the back unarmed civilians fleeing from them on the streets of a British city. Those responsible should hang their heads in shame.” However, the judge said that because there was no concept of “collective guilt” in the courts, he wasn’t able to issue a guilty ruling against Soldier F.  The sole evidence against Soldier F was from two other veterans, Soldiers G and H, one of whom is deceased while the other refused to take to the dock for fear of incriminating himself. “Their statements, the sole and decisive evidence, cannot be tested in a way that witnesses giving evidence from the witness box would be,” the judge said. “Delay has, in my view, seriously hampered the capacity of the defense to test the veracity and accuracy of the hearsay statements.” A blow to families of victims Mickey McKinney, brother of William McKinney who was shot dead on Bloody Sunday, said the failure to bring anyone to justice “lies with the British state” for failing to investigate the murders “properly, or indeed at all; and with the British Army who shielded and enabled its soldiers to continue to murder with impunity.” Over the decades since, Bloody Sunday has become a source of shame for a British government that had initially claimed that members of a parachute regiment fired in self-defense after being attacked by gunmen and others hurling firebombs.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Relief for veterans and their campaigners Supporters of army veterans complain that their losses have been downplayed and that they have been unfairly targeted in investigations. Defense lawyer Mark Mulholland attacked the prosecution’s case as “fundamentally flawed and weak” for relying on soldiers he dubbed “fabricators and liars,” and the fading memories of survivors who scrambled to avoid live gunfire that some mistakenly thought were rounds of rubber bullets. Veterans and their campaigners welcomed Thursday’s verdict.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It has become increasingly clear that the admissibility of certain types of evidence, particularly those based on decades-old recollections, remains deeply problematic,” said Northern Ireland veterans commissioner David Johnstone.  “Soldier F has faced legal scrutiny in various forms for more than a quarter of a century, and it is my hope that today’s ruling by Judge Lynch brings that long and arduous process to a close,” he added. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The long road to the case  Following the peace process that was initiated by the Good Friday Agreement, steps were taken to foster trust between Catholics and Protestants as well as between the people of Northern Ireland and the British government. An inquiry in 2010 found that the soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday had shot unarmed civilians fleeing and then lied in a cover-up that lasted for decades. Then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron apologized and said the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable.” The findings cleared the way for the eventual  prosecution of Soldier F , though delays and  setbacks kept it from coming to trial  until last month. On Thursday, a spokesman for current Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the not-guilty verdict was “an example of the complex legacy of the Troubles.” He said the government is “focused on setting out a way forward to deal with this difficult period in a fair and balanced way that allows victims to seek answers and get closure, including bereaved forces’ families.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-hypersonic-missiles-trump-kim-apec-36a8df48f67a885b45b89970cddef403","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"22:37:00+00:00","title":"North Korea Tests New Hypersonic Missile System Ahead of APEC Summit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korea conducted ballistic missile tests involving new hypersonic systems, claiming successful strikes on land targets in its northern region.

At a military parade earlier this month, Kim unveiled some of his military’s newest weapons, including what appeared to be a short-range ballistic system fitted with hypersonic glide vehicles.  \n    \n     ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n North Korea in recent years has been testing various missile systems tipped with  hypersonic weapons,  which are designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons are meant to help them evade regional missile defense systems, but experts have questioned whether they have consistently flown at the speeds the North claimed during tests. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Pak Jong Chon, one of Kim’s top military officials who attended Wednesday’s tests, lauded the performance of the “new cutting-edge weapon system” and said the North would continue efforts to bolster its war deterrent and defense capabilities.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n During the Oct. 10 parade, Kim also unveiled a new  intercontinental ballistic missile  that state media described as the country’s most powerful nuclear asset, adding to his growing collection of weapons with potential range to reach the U.S. mainland. Experts say the North could be preparing to test the missile in the coming weeks, ahead of a major ruling party conference in early 2026, when Kim is expected to announce key policy directions, potentially including his approach toward the United States. Kim has been sharply accelerating the pace of weapons tests since his high-stakes  nuclear diplomacy  with Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over the U.S.-led economic sanctions. Wednesday’s launches were North Korea’s first ballistic missile tests since liberal South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office in June,  pledging to restore peace  on the Korean Peninsula. But Kim has so far rejected Lee’s offer for talks and has said he won’t resume diplomacy with the United States unless Washington abandons its goal of denuclearizing the North."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/songwriters-hall-taylor-swift-ll-cool-j-7eece792aef4245434353fcaa8c5e5c9","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:08:52+00:00","title":"Taylor Swift, Kenny Loggins, and Others Nominated for 2026 Songwriters Hall of Fame","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Songwriters Hall of Fame has announced its 2026 class of nominees, featuring a diverse and historically significant mix of pop, rock, hip-hop, country, and R&B songwriters.

Swift,  Kenny Loggins,  LL Cool J,  Pink,  Sarah McLachlan  and Talking Heads’ David Byrne are among the impressive list of nominees for the 2026 Songwriters Hall of Fame class, an eclectic mix of pop, hip-hop, folk and rock innovators. Also on the ballot are Charlotte Caffey, Kathy Valentine and Jane M. Wiedlin of The Go-Go’s, Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings of The Guess Who, Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell of America and Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of  the glam rock band Kiss. News of Simmons and Stanley’s inclusion comes days after the death of Ace Frehley, Kiss’ original lead guitarist and founding member. Frehley, 74,  died Oct. 16  in New Jersey. Rounding out the performer-songwriter category is Richard Carpenter of The Carpenters (notable hits include “Goodbye To Love,” “Top Of The World” and “Yesterday Once More”), Harry Wayne Casey, better known as KC of KC and the Sunshine Band (“Rock Your Baby,” “That’s The Way (I Like It)” and “(Shake Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty”) and guitarist Boz Scaggs. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Hall annually inducts performers and non-performers alike.

The 2025 class  included George Clinton, The Doobie Brothers, Ashley Gorley, Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins, The Beach Boys’ Mike Love and Tony Macaulay. The 2026 inductees will be announced in early 2026."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2310-02-20","timeOfPublication":"23:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global issues including U.S.-Mexico border security under pressure from the Trump administration, fragile ceasefires along the Afghan-Pakistan border, controversial military strikes in the Caribbean with unclear motives, climate-related changes in Iceland, organized crime cases involving Chauncey Billups, Olympic victories by athletes from Taiwan and Algeria, and escalating Russian cyber and espionage efforts against the UK.

garden — where, according to the Gospel, Jesus spent the last night before being taken up the other side of the valley into Jerusalem to be crucified. For two years, the  Israel-Hamas war  has cast a pall on the Holy Land. The hundreds of centuries-old olive trees here have shaken periodically in  missile attacks  targeting Israel. But this year’s harvest happened as a  ceasefire agreement  was reached, spreading a tenuous hope for peace — peace that olive branches have symbolized since the biblical story of the dove that brought one back to Noah’s Ark to signify the end of the flood. “The land is a gift and the sign of a divine presence,” said the Rev. Diego Dalla Gassa, a Franciscan in charge of the harvest in the hermitage next to Gethsemane. The word Gethsemane is derived from the ancient Aramaic’s and Hebrew’s “oil press.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n For Dalla Gassa and the other mostly Catholic congregations on the hill, harvesting olives to make preserves and oil is not a business or even primarily a source of sustenance for their communities. Rather, it’s a form of prayer and reverence. “To be the custodian of holy sites doesn’t mean only to guard them, but to live them, physically but also spiritually,” he added. “It’s really the holy sites that guard us.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Harvesting olives by hand on the Mount of Olives  Early on a recent morning, Dalla Gassa traded his habit for a T-shirt and shorts — albeit with an olive wood cross around his neck — and headed to the terraces facing Jerusalem’s Old City. The bright sun shone off the golden dome of  Al-Aqsa Mosque , visible above the walls encircling the Temple Mount — the holiest site in Judaism — alongside the bell towers of Christian churches. Dalla Gassa and some volunteers, ranging from Israeli Jews to visiting Italian law enforcement officers, picked the black and green olives by hand and with tiny rakes, dropping them onto nets under the trees. Once they filled a wheelbarrow, Dalla Gassa put on ear covers and got the loud, modern press humming. Soon, the fragrance of freshly pressed green oil filled the air. It takes up to 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of olives to make one liter (34 ounces) of extra-virgin oil. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Harvesting as a form of prayer Up the hill from the Franciscan convent, Sister Marie Benedicte walked among more olive trees cradling the adopted kitty she has named “Petit Chat,” little cat in French. “It’s easy to pray while picking and nature is so beautiful,” she said later while starting her harvest. “It’s like a retreat time.” For more than two decades, the French nun has been in the Benedictine monastery founded at the end of the 19th century atop the Mount of Olives. Only half a dozen sisters live there now, their day flowing in a 16-hour rhythm of work, contemplative walks in the garden, and prayer. “It’s very quiet here, very simple,” said Sister Colomba, who is from the Philippines and is in charge of ensuring there’s always enough olive oil in the church lamps to keep them burning by the tabernacle. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Olive trees are an essential crop in this desert region where they’ve grown for millennia. For decades they’ve been at the heart of  sometimes-violent land disputes  between Palestinians and some Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Israel occupied it in the  1967 war  along with east Jerusalem, where the Mount of Olives is. The congregations on the hill do not have commercial productions, dedicating the vast majority of the oil to their own use, both in the kitchen and for sacraments. Many Christians use oil, blessed by clergy during an annual Chrism Mass, for rituals ranging from anointing the sick to blessing the baptized and new altars. “Only good when pressed”: Olives and religious symbolism For the religious brothers and sisters living among these trees, the harvest itself is spiritual and full of symbolism. “In picking the olives, we learn how we are picked. We go looking for that last olive — that’s what God does with us, even those who are a bit hard to reach,” said Dalla Gassa. Squeezing a plump green olive between his fingers, he also spoke of the sacrifice that comes with fulfilling one’s vocation of love for God and neighbor. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The olive is only good when pressed. It’s the same for us,” said Dalla Gassa. The volunteers who’ve been harvesting this year share in the transcendent experience as much as in the dusty, hot working days. “The garden is very special. It’s full of spirituality and holiness,” said Ilana Peer-Goldin, who on a recent morning was helping Dalla Gassa with the harvest. An Israeli raised in Jerusalem, she draws from Jewish, Catholic and Buddhist practices. Teresa Penta, who is from Puglia, Italy — one of  the Mediterranean area’s top olive-producing regions  — has spent 13 years in the hermitage next to Gethsemane. “This place has an eternal charm,” she said. The modern olive press has been in place only a few years. She said it added special meaning, returning Gethsemane to its original function. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n This year’s harvest has been meager because of drought and fierce springtime winds that damaged the blossoms. Still, other congregations have been sending their olives to be processed by the monastery of Latrun, about halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Latrun’s Trappist monks also have olive trees and vines, though thousands of them were destroyed by a  devastating fire this spring . Walking to the olive press outside the abbey church in his black-and-white habit, Brother Athanase said the oil and wine production helps the friars  earn their living . But the end goal is different for the contemplative religious. “To create the empty space while working with repetitive gesture, to be completely available to our Lord, Jesus Christ,” he said. “It’s a life to be received completely.” ___ AP journalist Melanie Lidman contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s  collaboration  with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Analysis: America’s 51st state? US pressure comes to bear on Israel\n\nA succession of high-ranking US officials have found themselves in Israel in recent days – first special envoy  Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner  on Monday, then Vice President  JD Vance  on Tuesday, and Secretary of State  Marco Rubio  on Thursday.\n\nTheir focus has been clear – to stop the US-backed  Gaza ceasefire deal  from collapsing. And that essentially means ensuring that the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not back out of the agreement, which ended two years of war earlier this month.\n\nThe presence of the US officials in Israel has been described as “babysitting” – designed to twist the arm of a far-right government itching to find any excuse to relaunch the war, which killed more than 68,000 Palestinians.\n\nAnd so far, the administration of US President Donald Trump appears to have largely succeeded, highlighting what some analysts deem to be Israeli subservience to the US, and an acknowledgment that when Washington orders Israel to do something, the latter will ultimately agree.\n\n“Of course, Israel is a client state of the US,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli ambassador and consul general in New York, told Al Jazeera. Pinkas referred to the billions of dollars Israel receives from the US in aid, the dozens of times Washington uses its veto to protect Israel from criticism or sanction at the United Nations, and its military protection of Israel.\n\nNow the Trump administration is leveraging that support and doing what is a rare occurrence when it comes to relations between the two countries: forcing Israel to act according to the US’s wishes, and making public Washington’s pressure on Israel.\n\nSome of that has come from Trump himself – in an interview published by Time Magazine on Thursday, the US president said that he had stopped Netanyahu from continuing the Gaza war. “You know, I stopped him, because he would have just kept going,” Trump said. “It could have gone on for years.”\n\nTrump also made it clear in the same interview that Israel would lose “all support” from the US if it proceeded with the annexation of the occupied West Bank, which its parliament or Knesset preliminarily approved on Wednesday. Vance also  voiced his opposition  to an Israeli parliamentary vote on annexation, calling it “very stupid”.\n\nNetanyahu understood the message, and his office called the vote a “political provocation” – even as members of his own government voted in favour, and even though he himself has previously backed annexation.\n\nThe US has always been the stronger party in the relationship with Israel. It is the global superpower, while Israel is an ally with a traditionally large constituency of support within the US.\n\nBut US governments, for whatever reason, have often tried to avoid any direct confrontation with Israel. Former US President Joe Biden adopted a “bear hug” policy towards Israel during the first three months of the war on Gaza, arguing that the Israelis needed to be publicly backed in order to convince them to avoid going too far in their destruction of the Palestinian enclave.\n\nThat did not work, with Netanyahu repeatedly ignoring attempts to get him to agree to a ceasefire. Instead, it was Trump, who is incredibly popular in Israel for the support he gave the country in his first term, who has taken the relatively more confrontational route with Israel since his return to the presidency. So far, it appears to be working.\n\n“Benjamin Netanyahu has been put on notice,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera. “The US team can say all these different things –  as they are doing –  but it’s pretty obvious what their agenda is.\n\n“Look at the 60 Minutes interview [US presidential adviser Jared] Kushner and [US special envoy Steve] Witkoff gave where they spoke of betrayal and a loss of control. To my mind, this contradicts all the shows of friendliness we’re seeing in the Israeli press. This is the Trump administration coming over and saying quite clearly: ‘You do as you’re told.'”\n\nMekelberg was referring to an interview aired by CBS News last week, in which Witkoff described both himself and Kushner as feeling “a little bit betrayed” by Israel’s decision to  strike  at the Hamas negotiating team in Doha, Qatar in September. Continuing, Kushner emphasised how Trump, his father-in-law, had felt the Israelis “were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing, and that it was time to be very strong and stop them from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests”.\n\nThat may go to the root of explaining how Trump, despite his clear support for Israel and his past disparagement of the Palestinians, has been so vocal in criticising Israeli actions. The framing from his administration is that Trump’s restraint of Israel is in the latter’s benefit, highlighting the primacy of the US in the relationship, while also emphasising the bond between the US and Israel.\n\n“The relationship between the US and Israel is a central part of both countries’ policies,” said Mitchell Barak, a former aide to Netanyahu. “It’s built on a shared sense of Judeo-Christian values, but Israel is also a valuable strategic partner to the US; it’s also vital in its regional policy as well as providing advances in innovation.”\n\n“And what’s more – as we’re seeing from both US business, as well as the Trump family business, who are heavily invested in the region – stability and peace are profitable for all.”\n\n“It’s true that Israel’s lost some of its independence in this, but there’s nothing new in that,” Barak added. “I think that’s what we’re seeing right now in the way the US is managing the ceasefire. It’s a combination of carrot and stick and right now, with Vance and the others over, is a reminder of the stick.”\n\nAnd as for the carrot, Trump can focus on what he believes Netanyahu wants – political success, and an end to the prime minister’s legal troubles.\n\nSpeaking at the Knesset to mark the ceasefire in early October, Trump called upon Israel’s President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu in the multiple corruption cases he has faced since 2019.\n\n“Trump can do that,” Mekelberg said. “He can say to Netanyahu, look, I’ll come over. I’ll talk to the Knesset, I can even ask for you to be pardoned, but in return, you follow the script.”\n\nSuggestions that Israel has lost much of its independence in its dealings with the US have appeared to rankle Netanyahu.\n\n‘‘I want to put it very clearly. One week, they say that Israel controls the United States. A week later, they say the United States controls Israel. This is hogwash,” said the prime minister, in response to a question about Israel being beholden to the US.\n\nIrrespective of Netanyahu’s protestations about US control of Israel, much of the evidence contradicts him. In addition to the current US diplomatic blitz, intended to ensure that Netanyahu carries through with the ceasefire, there are other instances of the Trump administration determining Israeli policy.\n\nThe ceasefire itself was announced during Netanyahu’s last visit to Washington, seen as a tactic by some observers intended to have the prime minister commit to its terms publicly before returning to Israel.\n\nSimilarly, during the same visit, Netanyahu found himself being shepherded into issuing a formal apology to the Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani for the strike on Doha. And critically, during the conclusion of Israel’s 12-day war on Iran in June, it was Trump who ordered Netanyahu to stop a planned Israeli strike after the start of the ceasefire.\n\nFor observers such as Pinkas, these actions have been a pointed reminder to Netanyahu and others of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship between Israel and the US, not least under the Trump administration.\n\n“They’re [also] delineating Israel’s freedom of movement,” Pinkas said. “They’re letting Netanyahu and others know that they’re free to go so far without consultation, but that’s it.\n\n“[And] they’re reminding Netanyahu that he’s essentially out of options in the US. The Democrats can’t stand him, public opinion has turned against him, and there are many in the Republican Party, and specifically the MAGA [Make America Great Again] wing, who are asking questions about him. He can no longer play one side against the other. This is it.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/brazils-president-lula-announces-he-will-seek-a-fourth-term-in-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:40:51Z","title":"Brazil’s President Lula announces he will seek a fourth term in 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has announced he will run for re-election in 2026, seeking a fourth nonconsecutive term, despite being 80 years old.

President Lula announces he will seek a fourth term in 2026\n\nBrazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  has announced he will run for re-election next year, seeking a fourth nonconsecutive term.\n\nSpeaking during a state visit to Indonesia on Thursday, President Lula said he remains energised despite his age.\n\n“I’m turning 80, but you can be sure I have the same energy I had when I was 30. And I’m going to run for a fourth term in Brazil,” Lula told reporters in a joint news conference with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.\n\nHe then turned to Subianto to deliver a quip: “I’m telling you this because we’re still going to see each other many times.”\n\nBrazil’s constitution allows presidents to serve only two consecutive terms. Lula, who served two terms in 2003-2010, returned to office in 2023 after 13 years out of power and thus remains eligible to run again.\n\nThe Brazilian leader is currently on a diplomatic trip across Asia. After his visit to Indonesia, Lula will head to Malaysia to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit.\n\nWhile in Malaysia, Lula is expected to meet on Sunday with United States President Donald Trump, their first in-person encounter following a conciliatory phone call earlier this month, Brazilian media has reported.\n\nThe two leaders  have clashed  over the prosecution of former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro — an ally of Trump — and international trade.\n\nTrump and Lula are expected to discuss the  50-percent trade tariff  that Trump imposed on Brazil in August, in protest against the Bolsonaro prosecution.\n\nLula had previously said his 2022 presidential bid would be his final campaign, both because of his age and because he believed the country needed political renewal. That election saw him narrowly defeat Bolsonaro in a run-off.\n\nBut early in his current term — his third — Lula began hinting that he might run again.\n\nIn February 2023, the president said he could seek re-election in 2026, adding that his decision would depend on the country’s political context and his health.\n\nA dominant figure on Brazil’s left, Lula is the country’s longest-serving president since its return to  democracy  40 years ago.\n\nSome Brazilian politicians have expressed concern about Lula’s age and recent health issues. He underwent emergency surgery to treat a brain bleed late last year after a fall in the bathroom. Still, Lula frequently insists he remains healthy and energetic, often sharing workout videos on social media.\n\nLula currently leads all polls for the 2026 election, though roughly half of voters say they disapprove of him. Trump’s tariffs reenergised the Brazilian leader and pushed his popularity up.\n\nHis main political rival, Bolsonaro, has been barred from running for office and was sentenced in September to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup.\n\nWhile no strong opposition candidate has yet emerged, analysts say a viable contender is likely to depend on Bolsonaro’s backing as he serves his sentence under house arrest."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, through its space agency SUPARCO.

Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, restricting 12 of the 17 known rare-earth elements—including five new ones—and banning exports of specialized refining equipment.

this matters\n\nChina tightened export controls for critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/un-pushes-for-worldwide-disaster-alerts-as-extreme-weather-spirals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:35:15+00:00","title":"UN pushes for worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, is urging global action to close critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of all countries lack them—especially in developing nations.

Timely alerts are crucial to saving lives as extreme weather events multiply due to climate change, it warned.\n\n“Many millions of people lack protection against dangerous weather, which is inflicting an increasing toll on economic assets and vital infrastructure,” said a statement by the WMO, noting that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early-warning systems.\n\nThe organisation said weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people in the past 50 years. It added that 90 percent of those deaths occurred in developing countries.\n\n“Impacts are spiralling as weather becomes more extreme,” it said.\n\nThe WMO acknowledged that there has been “huge progress” in climate monitoring over the last decade. The number of countries using some form of multi-hazard early warning systems has jumped from 52 to at least 108.\n\nHowever, it continued, an assessment of 62 countries showed half of them possess only basic capacity and 16 percent have less than basic capacity.\n\n“The situation is worst in fragile, conflict and violence-affected contexts,” the organisation said.\n\nNevertheless, the WMO is seeing progress in Africa, with more countries having functioning websites and issuing standardised alerts.\n\n“Early warning means early action. Our goal is to not only warn the world; it is to empower it,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a speech as the UN institution opened its annual conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\nThe world has been rocked by numerous weather-related disasters in 2025. Huge  flooding has rocked countries including Pakistan ,  Nigeria  and  South Korea . Wildfires have devastated large areas in  southern Europe , as well as  the US .\n\nThe head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told delegates at the conference that no country or region was spared from the effects of climate change and extreme weather.\n\nShe pointed to the example of how the regular monitoring of a mountain glacier allowed scientists to warn about its imminent collapse in May 2025, allowing for the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten.\n\n“Permafrost melt will inevitably lead to more glacier collapses and rockfalls,” making early warning systems vital, she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/five-dead-two-missing-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-soaks-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:40:23+00:00","title":"Five dead, two missing as Tropical Storm Fengshen soaks Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Fengshen caused widespread destruction across the Philippines in early October 2025, killing at least five people and leaving two missing.

outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"14:52:29Z","title":"Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, centered on a new threat of a 100% tariff from US President Donald Trump in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals.

2025-10-13T14:52:29+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China\n\nChina has accused the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/23/trump-live-mexicos-sheinbaum-rejects-us-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:00:57Z","title":"Trump calls drug cartels ‘ISIS of the Western hemisphere’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, during a roundtable hosted by the White House, refers to drug cartels as the 'ISIS of the Western hemisphere', emphasizing their violent nature and threat to national security.

Soldier F under a court anonymity order, was accused of murdering James Wray and William McKinney and attempting to murder five others when soldiers opened fire on unarmed Catholic civil rights marchers in Derry more than 50 years ago.\n\nBelfast Crown Court was silent on Thursday as Judge Patrick Lynch read the verdict acquitting Soldier F of two charges of murder and five of attempted

Soldier F listened to the verdict from behind a thick blue curtain, hidden from view in the packed courtroom.\n\nOn January 30, 1972, British paratroopers  opened fire on unarmed civil rights protesters  as more than 10,000 people marched in Derry. British soldiers shot at least 26 unarmed civilians. Thirteen people were killed, while another man died from his injuries four months later.\n\nThe massacre became a pivotal moment in the Troubles, helping to fuel nearly three decades of violence between Irish nationalists seeking civil rights and a united Ireland, pro-British unionists wanting Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom, and the British Army. A 1998 peace deal largely ended the bloodshed.\n\nLynch said in his verdict that he was satisfied that soldiers had lost all sense of military discipline and opened fire with intent to kill and that “those responsible should hang their heads in shame”.\n\nBut he said the case fell short of the burden of proof.\n\n“Delay has, in my view, seriously hampered the capacity of the defence to test the veracity and accuracy of the hearsay statements,” he said.\n\nAn initial investigation into the massacre — the Widgery Tribunal, an investigation held in 1972 — largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of responsibility.\n\nA second investigation, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, also known as the Saville Inquiry, found in June 2010 that there had been no justification for any of the shootings and found that paratroopers had fired at fleeing unarmed civilians.\n\nFollowing the Saville Inquiry, police in Northern Ireland launched a murder investigation, with prosecutors finding that one former soldier would face trial for two murders and five attempted murders.\n\nProsecutors have previously ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge 16 other former British soldiers.\n\nSoldier F was not called to give evidence during the one-month trial that was heard without a jury. He had previously told investigators he no longer had a reliable recollection of the massacre.\n\nMickey McKinney, brother of William McKinney, one of the two victims named in the case, denounced the verdict outside the courtroom on Thursday.\n\n“Soldier F has been discharged from the defendant’s criminal dock, but it is one million miles away from being an honourable discharge,” McKinney said. “Soldier F created two young widows on Bloody Sunday, he orphaned 12 children, and he deprived dozens of siblings of a loving brother,”\n\nMcKinney said he “firmly” blamed the British government for the trial’s outcome.\n\n“The blame lies firmly with the British state, with the RUC [the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Irish police], who failed to investigate the murders on Bloody Sunday properly, or indeed at all,” McKinney said.\n\nFollowing Thursday’s verdict, a spokesperson for the UK government said the UK is “committed to finding a way forward that acknowledges the past, whilst supporting those who served their country during an incredibly difficult period in Northern Ireland’s history”.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s First Minister Michelle O’Neill, who is vice president of the Sinn Fein pro-Irish unity party, called the verdict “deeply disappointing”.\n\n“The continued denial of justice for the Bloody Sunday families is deeply disappointing,” she  wrote on X . “Not one British soldier or their military and political superiors has ever been held to account. That is an affront to justice.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/uk-police-arrest-three-men-on-suspicion-of-spying-for-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:24:16+00:00","title":"UK police arrest three men on suspicion of spying for Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 23, 2025, UK police arrested three men—aged 44, 45, and 48—in west and central London on suspicion of assisting Russia’s foreign intelligence service under the 2023 National Security Act.

to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up the glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kidafell, Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley around 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Cuilseta annulata are not known to carry disease, but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well-adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“However, their development is slower, their active season shorter, and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley, from the Royal Entomological  Society, told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes, but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Iceland and Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland is, in fact, abundant with. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction, and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from -1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11 degrees Celsius (52 degrees Fahrenheit) in the warmer months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year – making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s, when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how these particular mosquitoes came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May this year, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were some 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting, and are projected to lose about half of their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website states.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens [diseases] they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then, in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September this year, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae from areas in which they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, which serve as ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\nTilley added that these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study patterns in climate change, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/23/trump-live-mexicos-sheinbaum-rejects-us-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats?update=4055788","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:00:57Z","title":"Trump calls drug cartels ‘ISIS of the Western hemisphere’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent statement, President Donald Trump labeled drug cartels as the 'ISIS of the Western hemisphere,' framing them as a severe national security threat comparable to terrorist organizations.

Donald Trump would oppose Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank, and it would not happen, suggesting a move by Israeli lawmakers towards that end looked like a “stupid political stunt”.\n\nA bill applying Israeli law to the West Bank, a move tantamount to annexation of a territory that Palestinian leaders seek for part of a future independent state,  won preliminary approval  from Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nAsked by reporters about the vote, Vance said on Thursday, “If it was a political stunt, it is a very stupid one, and I personally take some insult to it.”\n\nVance spoke after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that steps towards annexing the territory, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, could endanger Trump’s plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza, which has yielded a shaky ceasefire so far, with Israel violating the truce repeatedly.\n\n“The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of President Trump is that the West Bank will not be annexed. This will always be our policy,” Vance said at the end of a two-day visit to Israel.\n\nThe vote was sponsored by Avi Maoz, the leader of the far-right Noam party, who, until recently, was in the governing right-wing coalition, and backed by ultranationalists National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The reading passed by a vote of 25-24 out of 120 lawmakers.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office later said that the vote was a “deliberate political provocation” that aimed to sow division during Vance’s visit.\n\nNetanyahu’s far-right Likud party said it did not vote for the bill, adding that without its support, attempts to legislate the annexation of the West Bank were “unlikely to go anywhere”.\n\nHowever, observers say de facto annexation is slowly taking place across the West Bank as Israel continues to expand illegal settlements on Palestinian land.\n\nMore than 700,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nAll of Israel’s settlements are illegal under international law. The UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice, in 2024 said that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal, and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.\n\nSettlers have also been emboldened by far-right officials to carry out attacks against Palestinians, their lands, and properties. Often armed, and backed by Israeli soldiers, settlers storm Palestinian villages, uproot olive trees, burn homes and vehicles, and assault residents with near-total impunity.\n\nRights groups say the Israeli army rarely intervenes to stop settler violence, and in many cases, actively shields or assists those carrying out the attacks.\n\nMore than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since Israel began its assault on Gaza on October 7, 2023, according to the UN. Thousands of Palestinians were forcibly displaced due to Israeli settler attacks, movement restrictions and home demolitions.\n\nAccording to the UN, the first half of 2025 has seen 757 settler attacks causing casualties or property damage – a 13 percent increase compared with the same period last year.\n\nIsraeli forces have also intensified violent incursions on Palestinian towns and villages, while also arresting thousands of Palestinians.\n\nMost notably, Israel attacked the refugee camps in Jenin, Tulkarem, Nur Shams, Far’a and Nablus, generating mass displacement that was unprecedented.\n\nThe US has long been Israel’s most powerful and staunch ally, and the Trump administration is particularly close to Israel, with considerable sway over its leadership.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly ruled out Palestinian statehood. His cabinet has considered the idea of annexation as a response to major Western allies recently recognising a Palestinian state to put pressure on Israel to stop its devastating war in Gaza, but appeared to shelve it after Trump objected last month.\n\nSenior White House officials and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have been visiting Israel seeking to bolster the 13-day-old truce between Israel and Hamas after two years of war. Israeli attacks on the blockaded enclave have killed more than 68,000 Palestinians since October 2023, destroyed large swaths of land, and displaced most of the Strip’s 2.1 million residents.\n\nRubio arrived in Israel on Thursday on a visit to support the implementation of Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, the US Department of State said. The plan envisages eventual reconstruction and stable governance in the enclave, along with possible steps towards Palestinian statehood.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkiye and 13 other Muslim-majority nations condemned Wednesday’s vote, as did the key multilateral organisations that represent Arab states and Muslim nations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/23/trump-live-mexicos-sheinbaum-rejects-us-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats?update=4055777","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:00:57Z","title":"Trump calls drug cartels ‘ISIS of the Western hemisphere’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent roundtable hosted by the White House, former President Donald Trump drew a striking comparison between drug cartels and ISIS, calling them the 'ISIS of the Western hemisphere' to underscore their threat to national and regional security.

crisis in Gaza is ‘catastrophic’ despite ceasefire, WHO chief says\n\nThe hunger crisis in Gaza remains “catastrophic” two weeks after the ceasefire took effect, the UN’s health agency has warned, as international aid groups demanded Israel stop blocking humanitarian deliveries.\n\nSupplies entering the besieged enclave are not meeting the nutritional needs of the people living there, aid groups announced Thursday, while the UN’s World Food Programme said that supplies into Gaza were still far short of its daily target of 2,000 tonnes because only two crossings into the Palestinian territory are open.\n\n“The situation still remains catastrophic because what’s entering is not enough,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, chief of the World Health Organization said, adding that “there is no dent in hunger because there is not enough food.”\n\nAt least a quarter of Gaza’s population, including 11,500 pregnant women, is starving, the UN warned on Wednesday, saying the effects of malnutrition will have “generational” impacts in Gaza.\n\nSeventy percent of newborns are premature or underweight, compared with 20 percent before October 2023, Andrew Saberton, deputy executive director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), said Wednesday.\n\n“Malnutrition will have generational effects, not on the mother, but on the newborn, likely to result in ever longer lasting care and problems throughout the life of the baby,” he added.\n\nA famine was declared in Gaza City and its surrounding area in August, with the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) saying at the time that more than 500,000 people in the Gaza Strip  faced “catastrophic conditions” .\n\nA US-brokered ceasefire took effect  on October 10. As part of the ceasefire agreement, humanitarian aid deliveries were to be ramped up, with the UN aiming for approximately 2,000 tonnes of aid entering on a daily basis. But only  approximately 750 metric tonnes  of food are entering the Gaza Strip daily, the WFP announced Tuesday, because  only two of the Israeli-controlled crossings  into Gaza are operational – Karem Abu Salem in the south and al-Karara in the centre (called Kerem Shalom and Kissufim in Israel, respectively).\n\n“The situation in the Gaza Strip remains catastrophic, even two weeks after the ceasefire began,” Bahaa Zaqout, director of external relations at the Palestinian NGO PARC, said.\n\nZaqout cited examples of biscuits, chocolate and soda being allowed in on commercial trucks, while items, such as seeds and olives remained restricted from entering.\n\n“Unfortunately, these do not respond to the minimum nutritional values required for children, women and the most vulnerable groups,” he added, saying that while some fruits and vegetables are entering Gaza, they are exorbitantly expensive.\n\nOne kilogram (2.2 pounds) of tomatoes, which used to cost one shekel, now costs about 15 shekels ($4.50), he said.\n\nForty-one aid organisations, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, released an open letter Thursday accusing Israel of “arbitrarily” rejecting aid shipments into Gaza, saying the Israeli government has routinely blocked their requests to begin humanitarian efforts in earnest.\n\n“Between 10 and 21 October,  99 requests  by international NGOs to deliver aid into Gaza were rejected, while six requests submitted by the UN agencies were denied,” the letter stated. “Aid denied by Israeli authorities includes tents and tarpaulins, blankets, mattresses, food and nutrition supplies, hygiene kits, sanitation materials, assistive devices, and children’s clothing, all of which should be unrestricted during the ceasefire.”\n\nOn Wednesday , the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled Israel has an obligation to ensure the “basic needs” of the population in Gaza are met. In April, lawyers for the United Nations and Palestinian representatives at the ICJ accused Israel of breaking international law by refusing to let aid into Gaza between March and May.\n\nWhile some aid has been allowed into Gaza since then, humanitarian groups say much more is needed and demand that Israel provide more access.\n\n“Supplies are packaged, staff are equipped and ready to respond at scale,” aid organisations stated in their open letter on Thursday. “What we need now is access. Israeli authorities must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law and the terms of the ceasefire agreement.”\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza  has killed at least 68,280 people and wounded 170,375 since October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities. At least 1,139 people were killed in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel and more than 200 others were taken captive."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/we-do-not-agree-mexicos-claudia-sheinbaum-speaks-against-us-air-strikes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"19:24:21+00:00","title":"‘We do not agree’: Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum speaks against US air strikes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly condemned the United States’ recent air strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans, which have killed at least 37 people and targeted vessels allegedly carrying narcotics.

Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum speaks against US air strikes\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has spoken out against the recent spate of air strikes the United States has conducted in the Caribbean Sea and, more recently, the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn her morning news conference on Thursday, Sheinbaum was asked about her position on the bombing campaign.\n\n“Obviously, we do not agree,” Sheinbaum replied. “There are international laws on how to operate when dealing with the alleged illegal transport of drugs or guns on international waters, and we have expressed this to the government of the United States and publicly.”\n\nSheinbaum is the latest Latin American leader to express opposition to the air strikes, which have killed at least 37 people since the campaign began on September 2.\n\nMexico has had to strike a delicate balance with the US since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January.\n\nAmong Trump’s second-term priorities were stemming the flow of undocumented immigration across the US-Mexico border and implementing protectionist trade measures, most notably tariffs, to tamp down on foreign competition.\n\nTo pursue those goals, Trump has placed pressure on the Sheinbaum administration to comply with his demands.\n\nIn late January, for instance, the Trump White House announced it would slap the US’s neighbours and biggest trading partners — Mexico and Canada — with 25 percent tariffs on their exports.\n\nThe Trump administration  argued  the steep tax hike was necessary to hold the countries “accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country”.\n\nSeveral days later, on February 3, Trump agreed to pause the tariffs for 30 days, but only after receiving concessions from both countries.\n\nIn Mexico’s case, Sheinbaum  agreed  to “immediately reinforce” its border with the US with 10,000 National Guard soldiers, in an effort to crack down on drug trafficking.\n\nIn a phone call between the leaders, Trump reportedly paid Sheinbaum a compliment, “You’re tough.” Sheinbaum has since  been referred to  in media reports as the “Trump whisperer”.\n\nBut the 25 percent tariff nevertheless came into effect that March, and the Trump administration  has continued  to squeeze Mexico on trade and other issues.\n\nIn July, for instance, Trump posted a letter addressed to Sheinbaum on his social media platform Truth Social, threatening to raise tariffs against Mexico by 30 percent to force further action to stop fentanyl trafficking.\n\nTrump acknowledged his “strong relationship” with Sheinbaum, but blamed her government for falling short.\n\n“Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,” Trump  wrote . “Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground.”\n\nIf Sheinbaum retaliated with tariffs of her own, Trump warned that he would add the same amount on top of the 30 percent tariff. Eventually, Trump  backed away  from his threat of increased tariffs after a call with Sheinbaum.\n\nA month earlier, in June, the US Treasury also  sanctioned  three top Mexican banks and financial institutions, accusing them of being vehicles for laundering illicit drug money.\n\nThe banks denied the charges, but the fallout was swift, with some of the sanctioned institutions reporting that their access to international financial platforms was severed.\n\nBut Trump’s increasingly aggressive posture towards drug-smuggling cartels has prompted fears that his administration might take military action on Mexican soil.\n\nThe escalation began early in Trump’s second term, when he announced his intention to label Latin American cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations”, a designation largely given to armed groups who seek to destabilise the US through violence.\n\nThough the “terrorist” label alone does not constitute authorisation for military action, critics feared it was a step towards such an intervention.\n\nThen, in May, both Sheinbaum and Trump  acknowledged  that the US had offered to send its soldiers to Mexico to combat local drug cartels. That revelation came as the US built up its military presence along its shared border with Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum confirmed to reporters that she had  rejected the offer . “Sovereignty is not for sale,” she said. “Sovereignty is loved and defended.”\n\nIn August, Sheinbaum once again had to allay fears of an impending US action on Mexican soil. That month, reports emerged that Trump had secretly signed an order authorising US military force against Latin American cartels, raising fears of an attack on foreign soil.\n\nSheinbaum maintained the US would not conduct operations on Mexican territory, though. “We cooperate, we collaborate, but there will be no invasion,” she told reporters. “That is ruled out, absolutely ruled out. We have stated this in every call.”\n\nStill, the Trump administration has hinted in recent weeks that a land-based attack is imminent, as it conducts a series of deadly air strikes on alleged drug dealers.\n\nThe target of such an attack remains unknown. But on Wednesday, in an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump reaffirmed his plans to launch such a strike, even without the US Congress’s approval.\n\n“ We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,” Trump said of the alleged drug-traffickers. “And they haven’t experienced that yet. But now we’re totally prepared to do that.”\n\nSo far, the  air strike campaign  that began in September has focused on targets in the Caribbean Sea, near Venezuela and Colombia. This week, however, that campaign expanded to the Pacific Ocean, near Colombia’s western coast.\n\nTrump has identified the targets as small boats — and, in one case, a submarine — that he alleges were carrying narcotics to the US. But his administration has provided no evidence to substantiate those allegations, and officials in Latin America have warned that some of the victims appear to be fishermen.\n\nEcuador, for instance, released one of the two survivors of the attack on the submarine, claiming it had no evidence of criminal charges against the man.\n\nColombia’s President Gustavo Petro, meanwhile, has claimed a fisherman named Alejandro Carranza was killed in the strikes. Families in Trinidad and Tobago, which is situated close to the Venezuelan coastline, have also expressed concern that their missing relatives were among the deceased.\n\nNine strikes have been carried out against nautical vessels since September, the most recent on Wednesday.\n\nLegal experts, including human rights officials at the United Nations, have warned that the strikes likely violate international law, which prohibits extrajudicial killings outside of combat."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/will-trumps-sanctions-against-russian-oil-giants-hurt-putin","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:09:51Z","title":"Will Trump’s sanctions against Russian oil giants hurt Putin?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States, under President Donald Trump, has announced new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, marking the first such action by the current administration.

This marks the first time the current Trump administration has imposed direct sanctions on Russia.\n\nSpeaking alongside Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he hoped the sanctions would not need to be in place for long, but expressed growing frustration with stalled truce negotiations.\n\n“Every time I speak to Vladimir [Putin], I have good conversations and then they don’t go anywhere. They just don’t go anywhere,” Trump said, shortly after a planned in-person meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Budapest was  cancelled .\n\nTrump’s move is designed to cut off vital oil revenues, which help fund Russia’s ongoing war efforts. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia unleashed a new  bombardment  on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, killing at least seven people, including children.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the new sanctions were necessary because of “Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war”. He said that Rosneft and Lukoil fund the Kremlin’s “war machine”.\n\nThe new measures will freeze assets owned by Rosneft and Lukoil in the US, and bar US entities from engaging in business with them.  Thirty subsidiaries  owned by Rosneft and Lukoil have also been sanctioned.\n\nRosneft, which is controlled by the Kremlin, is Russia’s second-largest company in terms of revenue, behind natural gas giant Gazprom. Lukoil is Russia’s third-largest company and its biggest non-state enterprise.\n\nBetween them, the two groups export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day, or 70 percent of Russia’s overseas crude oil sales. Rosneft alone is responsible for nearly half of Russia’s oil production, which in all makes up 6 percent of global output.\n\nIn recent years, both companies have been hit by  rolling European sanctions  and reduced oil prices. In September, Rosneft reported a 68 percent year-on-year drop in net income for the first half of 2025. Lukoil posted an almost 27 percent fall in profits for 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, last week, the United Kingdom unveiled sanctions on the two oil majors. Elsewhere, the European Union looks set to announce its 19th package of penalties on Moscow  later today , including a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas.\n\nIn 2022, Russian oil groups (including Rosneft and Lukoil) were able to offset some of the effects of sanctions by pivoting exports from Europe to Asia, and also using a “ shadow fleet ” of hard-to-detect tankers with no ties to Western financial or insurance groups.\n\nChina and India quickly replaced the EU as Russia’s biggest oil consumers. Last year, China imported a record 109 million tonnes of Russian crude, representing almost 20 percent of its total energy imports. India imported 88 million tonnes of Russian oil in 2024.\n\nIn both cases, these are orders of magnitude higher than before 2022, when Western countries started to tighten their sanctions regime on Russia. At the end of 2021, China imported roughly 79.6 million tonnes of Russian crude. India imported just 0.42 million tonnes.\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged Beijing and  New Delhi  to halt Russian energy purchases. In August, he levied an additional 25 percent trade tariff on India because of its continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. He has so far  demurred from a similar move against China .\n\nHowever, Trump’s new sanctions are likely to place pressure on foreign financial groups which do business with Rosneft and Lukoil, including the banking intermediaries which facilitate sales of Russian oil in China and India.\n\n“Engaging in certain transactions involving the persons designated today may risk the imposition of secondary sanctions on participating foreign financial institutions,” the US Treasury Department’s press release on Wednesday’s sanctions says.\n\nAs a result, the new restrictions may force buyers to shift to alternative suppliers or pay higher prices. Though India and China may not be the direct targets of these latest restrictions, their oil supply chains and trading costs are likely to come under increased pressure.\n\n“The big thing here is the secondary sanctions,” Felipe Pohlmann Gonzaga, a Switzerland-based commodity trader, told Al Jazeera. “Any bank that facilitates Russian oil sales and with exposure to the US financial system could be subject.”\n\nHowever, he added, “I don’t think this will be the driver in ending the war, as Russia will continue selling oil. There are always people out there willing to take the risk to beat sanctions.\n\n“These latest restrictions will make Chinese and Indian players more reluctant to buy Russian oil – many won’t want to lose access to the American financial system. [But] it won’t stop it completely.”\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, several senior refinery executives in India – who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue – said the restrictions would make it impossible for oil purchases to continue.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said that he would raise concerns about China’s continued purchases of Russian oil during his talk with President Xi Jinping at the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea  next week .\n\nOil prices rallied after Trump announced US sanctions. Brent – the international crude oil benchmark – rose nearly 4 percent to $65 a barrel on Thursday. The US Benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, jumped more than 5 percent to nearly $60 per barrel.\n\nPohlmann Gonzaga, however, predicted that the “market will correct from this 5 percent over-jump. You have to recall that sentiment in energy markets is still negative due to the  gloomy [global] economic backdrop .”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025, aiming to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14 to combat cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women daily.

campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2310-10-23","timeOfPublication":"23:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global developments in science, technology, and geopolitics.

Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:32:37+00:00","title":"Trump torpedoes international deal to reduce shipping emissions","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan, calling it a 'Global Green New Scam Tax'.

to reduce shipping emissions\n\nMembers of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping,

gunfire aimed at incoming Ukrainian drones are becoming increasingly common, as Kyiv retaliates against repeated bombardments of its cities with cross-border strikes of its own.\n\n\"It's so loud and so terrifying,\" says Nina, a Belgorod resident who asked us to change her name.\n\n\"I was coming back from the clinic when a siren went off. As usual, I received Telegram alerts about a drone attack. Then bursts of automatic gunfire broke out, I ran into a nearby courtyard and tried to hide under an arch,\" she recalls.\n\n\"The next day it all happened again - air defence fire, automatic gunfire, explosions.\"\n\nThe number of Ukrainian drone attacks on the Belgorod region has increased nearly fourfold since the start of 2025, according to BBC News Russian analysis based on data from local authorities.\n\nIn September, more than 4,000 Ukrainian drones were recorded in the Belgorod region, compared with around 1,100 in January 2025. In one of the biggest strikes last month, the region was attacked with more than 260 drones, according to the governor. There has also been an increase in missile attacks since the summer.\n\nUkraine continues to suffer far greater losses from Russia's near-daily missile and drone strikes, which routinely kill civilians and leave cities across the country without power and heat.\n\nAt least seven people were killed, including two children, in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight into Wednesday, and there are fears that the coming winter may be the harshest yet for Ukraine.\n\nRead more :  What's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?\n\nEU set to endorse deal to turn frozen Russian assets into support for Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say the recent surge of attacks on Belgorod, some of which have caused huge blackouts, is a direct result of Russia's latest onslaught on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\n\n\"Maybe they should stop being too comfortable there in Belgorod?\" Zelensky said earlier this month. \"They must understand: if they want to leave us without power, then we will do the same\".\n\nBelgorod region is a key logistics corridor and staging hub for Russian forces near the border with Ukraine. It is also a regular point of origin for artillery and short-range drone strikes.\n\nAlthough there were local electricity outages in smaller towns in the region earlier in the war, the city of Belgorod was largely unaffected by power cuts until this autumn.\n\nLocal student Ekaterina (not her real name) told the BBC she was at home in the city on the evening of 28 September, when notifications started appearing on her phone: \"Missile alert! Take shelter!\"\n\nThe sound of howling sirens followed, and the lights in her flat started flickering.\n\n\"We ran to the corridor, because the explosions started almost immediately. They were very loud. The lights blinked and went out,\" Ekaterina recalls.\n\nMissiles had hit the main Belgorod heat and power plant and a substation, local Telegram channels reported.\n\nAnd while the city centre had its electricity back relatively quickly, some in the suburbs were left without power until morning. Across the region, around 77,000 people, or 5% of the population, still had no electricity the next day.\n\n\"While you're in the office in the centre, you wouldn't necessarily notice that there was a blackout. But when you're going home it's like entering a whole different world,\" another Belgorod resident Natalya (not her real name) tells the BBC.\n\n\"Complete darkness outside. Apartment blocks are without power, the shops are dark too. As you ride through the darkness, it's hard to tell where your stop is - you can't see anything\".\n\nAnother big blackout came less than a week later.\n\nAuthorities admit they do not have the capacity to provide everyone with back-up generators and have called on residents to buy their own.\n\n\"But what are we suppose to fuel them with, given the fuel crisis?\" Maria, an elderly resident who also asked to change her name, tells the BBC.\n\nMore than half of Russia's regions, including Belgorod, have been affected by petrol and diesel shortages, due to increased Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries.\n\n\"And the prices for generators have shot up as well,\" Maria says.\n\nUkraine has increased production of its \"Darts\" drone - lightweight and cheap models that can carry a 4kg (9lb) warhead - and many Belgorod residents say this is the reason the strikes have become more frequent. The drones are effective both for single and mass launches which can potentially overload air defence systems.\n\nBut the recent strikes on energy infrastructure that caused the blackouts in Belgorod are more likely to have involved heavier weapons. Reports say long-range Himars rockets or Morok drones with larger warheads might have been used.\n\nAnd while for many in Russia the war still seems far away, residents of Belgorod region now feel its impact daily, like Ukrainians over the border.\n\n\"Until September, the war seemed to have faded into the background again. But now we are getting constant reminders - through power outages, fuel shortages, and a general sense of anxiety\", says Yakov, who declined to give his real name.\n\n\"I personally have a strong feeling that, by continuing the war, Russia is racing headlong toward the abyss\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Ilya Abishev"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xvj108z9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:35:42.100+00:00","title":"Vance and Rubio criticise Israeli parliament's vote on West Bank annexation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have strongly criticized a symbolic vote in Israel's Knesset to apply Israeli law in the occupied West Bank, calling it a 'very stupid political stunt' and a threat to President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.

Rubio warned before flying to Israel that annexation would threaten President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's prime minister called the move a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\".\n\nA statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that his right-wing Likud party and its ultra-Orthodox coalition partners did not vote for the bill, \"except for one disgruntled Likud member who was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee\".\n\n\"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it added.\n\nThe prime minister's office put out the statement in English after Vance was asked about the vote by reporters before he boarded his plane at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.\n\n\"If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult,\" he said. \"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.\"\n\n\"That will continue to be our policy. If people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that. But we certainly weren't happy about it.\"\n\nTime magazine also published an interview with President Trump in which he insisted that annexation would not happen \"because I gave my word to the Arab countries.\"\n\n\"Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,\" he added.\n\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.\n\nThe settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice last year.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu has previously spoken in support of annexing West Bank land but has not advanced this due to the risk of alienating the US - Israel's most important ally - and Arab countries which have built relations with Israel after decades of enmity.\n\nUltra-nationalists in Netanyahu's governing coalition have repeatedly called for Israel to annex the West Bank outright, though the bill was put forward by MPs outside the government.\n\nThe bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether it has support to win a majority in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament), and there are ways the prime minister can delay or defeat it.\n\nThe bill will now be discussed by the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and would have to pass three more readings to become law.\n\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's move, saying Israel would have no sovereignty over Palestinian land.\n\nBefore leaving for Israel on Wednesday night, Rubio said annexation would be \"counterproductive\" for Trump's Gaza peace plan - reiterating  US opposition to annexation .\n\n\"I think the president's made clear that's not something we'd be supportive of right now.

Pope Leo and King Charles make history by praying side by side\n\nKing Charles and Pope Leo made history in the Sistine Chapel by praying side by side - a first for the leaders of the Church of England and Catholic Church.\n\nUnder the scrutinising eyes of Michelangelo's Last Judgment, when Pope Leo said \"let us pray\", it meant everyone, including the King, closing a gap that stretched back to the Reformation in the 16th Century.\n\nWith music and prayers about nature that would bridge any theological divide, the service offered the King and Queen some calm amid scrutiny over Prince Andrew during their Vatican visit.\n\nBut despite the significance of the state visit, there was no escaping the media - with questions about Andrew's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that show no sign of abating.\n\nEven here, as he met the Pope inside the Vatican, the King commented that the cameras were a \"constant hazard\".\n\nRather laconically the Pope said: \"You get used to it\", as he too has faced a rapid lesson in the unrelenting attention that comes with such a high-profile role, although it still seems a surprise to hear a Pope speaking in such relaxed American tones.\n\nThere might be irritation at the media during such moments, but without the press such state visits wouldn't really exist.\n\nIt's all about big images for the media to capture, because no members of the public are allowed past the security barriers to watch.\n\nIt's the intruding lenses of the cameras and the words rushed out for news websites that give such moments shape and impact. Otherwise they could do a state visit on Zoom.\n\nThere were many such elegantly choreographed moments in this whistle-stop visit to the Vatican, a city state where every corner could be a postcard, creaking under the weight of its own history and architectural splendour.\n\nIn the Sistine Chapel the Catholic and Anglican choirs literally sang from the same hymn sheet. The images of harmony and unity were there in abundance. Once hostile churches were now the closest friends.\n\nSurrounded by Renaissance masterpieces, this was a meeting in one of the great cradles of Western civilisation. A lover of art, music and religion, this must have been a big occasion for King Charles.\n\nBut actually later in the day there seemed to be a more intense moment, something that gave the King and Queen a chance to pause for more private prayer and reflection.\n\nAt the church of St Paul Outside the Walls they walked down some steps to the tomb of St Paul, one of Christ's apostles. It was like walking down to the roots of Christianity. They waited there a moment and there were some prayers recited.\n\nThe King and Queen, who had switched to a white outfit after wearing black to meet the Pope, walked back up the main body of the church, where another congregation were waiting. Maybe they could have done with a few more minutes in such a simple and sacred place.\n\nBut they returned to the huge and gorgeously embellished basilica above. Even by the epic standards of churches in Rome, this was remarkably massive, with choirs once again to fill the operatically high ceilings.\n\nThe symbolic point of coming here was that before the Reformation this was a church associated with the English monarchy. It was joining up the historical dots.\n\nAs the day ended, the King and Queen and Vatican will have seen this visit as fulfilling its historic purpose, binding the Catholic and Anglican churches together at the top in a knot of friendship, as they often already can be at the grassroots.\n\nThere were exchanges of gifts, including an icon given to Pope Leo, reflecting the King's fascination with the Orthodox Church and its images.\n\nThere were also knighthoods exchanged between King Charles and Pope Leo, but at the moment there might be a question about the value of honours.\n\nFor Buckingham Palace, it will have been the completion of a state visit that had previously been postponed by the ill-health of Pope Francis. And it might have been a welcome pause from the growing pressure for answers about Prince Andrew.\n\nMaybe the message was about reconciliation, even if it takes centuries. In the Sistine Chapel there was a serene moment with the singing of a piece by the English Catholic composer Thomas Tallis.\n\nHe lived in south London during the some of the vicious and violent religious conflicts of the 16th Century, making his music against this troubled background.\n\nFive centuries later, his music was being played for a King and a Pope, who were no longer fighting but were on same side.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

alliance\n\nFor decades it was one of Washington's closest alliances.\n\nUnited in their fight against drug trafficking, Colombia and the United States co-operated closely, with the latter receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in US military assistance annually.\n\nBut now that alliance appears be more fragile than ever.\n\nThe leaders of the two countries may have a similar style - forceful and not prone to mincing their words - but left-wing Gustavo Petro and Donald Trump come from opposing ends of the political spectrum and have clashed frequently since Trump returned to the White House in January.\n\nOn Sunday, tensions reached their highest point when Trump accused Petro of encouraging drug production in Colombia and announced the suspension of payments and subsidies to the South American country.\n\nThis came after Petro had in turn accused US officials of murdering a Colombian citizen and violating his country's sovereignty in one of the multiple strikes that the US military has carried out against alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean since early September.\n\nBBC Mundo spoke to experts who warned that with the alliance in jeopardy, both Colombia and the US could be at risk of losing out while organised crime groups look set to benefit.\n\nColombia became one of the main beneficiaries of US aid in the early 2000s, with the money going towards \"Plan Colombia\" - a US-funded initiative to combat drug trafficking groups, reduce the flow of drugs to the US, and strengthen the Colombian security forces.\n\nThis investment is credited with weakening the Farc guerrilla group, which was at war with the state before officially demobilising in 2016.\n\nSince then, US assistance has been reduced - and has come under questioning.\n\nDespite Colombia's military successes against armed groups, and its recent years of relative stability and security, some analysts doubt whether Plan Colombia truly resolved the drug problem in the long term.\n\nCocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to  researcher Héctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe level of cultivation of coca, the key ingredient in cocaine, is also at record highs, although the Colombian government maintains that the rate of crop expansion has been slowing since 2021.\n\nThe US military campaign in the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking paradoxically demonstrates that drugs have not been eradicated in the region and remain a priority for Washington.\n\nThe strengthening of the security forces under Plan Colombia also had collateral effects.\n\nParamilitary groups became involved in abuses against civilians, and some demobilised members of these groups later joined the drug-trafficking business.\n\nSimilarly, the high number of military personnel in the early 2000s produced a large pool of young, retired soldiers, some of whom have been accused of signing up as mercenaries to fight in foreign conflicts.\n\nDespite the reduction in funding in previous years, US aid to Colombia still exceeded $400m (£300m) in 2024, according to estimates by the US-based research organisation Washington Office on Latin America (Wola).\n\nElizabeth Dickinson, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told BBC Mundo that Colombia remained \"by far, the closest US partner in the fight against narcotics in all of Latin America\".\n\n\"It's been almost three decades of US investment, training, and an unprecedented level of coordination,\" Ms Dickinson said.\n\nThe alliance has made Colombia and the US reliant on each other in terms of security. Today, thanks in part to US aid, Colombia has one of the most powerful militaries in Latin America.\n\nIn turn, Washington relies heavily on Bogotá for its counter-narcotics operations, Ms Dickinson explains.\n\n\"About 80% of the intelligence the US uses to intercept drugs in the Caribbean comes from Colombia.\"\n\nMilitary aid is not the only funding Colombia has received from the US in recent decades.\n\nWith the help of USAID - Washington's foreign policy and development aid agency - Colombia launched several peace and growth projects, especially in poor and conflict-ridden areas.\n\nBut earlier this year, the Trump administration announced the de facto dismantling of the agency.\n\nColombia, USAID's largest beneficiary in the region, saw many of its initiatives cancelled and dozens of jobs lost.\n\n\"The other sources of aid come from the State Department in the form of civilian and defense funding,\" Ms Dickinson explains.\n\nShe says that the assistance that exists today - which Trump appeared to refer to in his announcement of cuts - funds communications, intelligence, and equipment capabilities in Colombia, such as helicopters.\n\n\"But beyond these funding issues, the seizure, capture, and high-value operations that Colombia carries out are frequently co-ordinated with the United States,\" she continues.\n\n\"Not only is economic aid lost, but also the institutional relationship between the two countries combating a shared threat.\"\n\nIn mid-September, the US for the first time in 30 years,  officially named Colombia as a country which it said had \"demonstrably failed\" to uphold its obligations to control drug trafficking  - thereby opening the door to a funding cut.\n\nHowever, at the time Washington stopped shot of cutting the aid flow, leaving the move as a warning.\n\nBut just a month later, the feared cuts appear to be materialising.\n\nThe latest rift between Trump and Petro comes at perhaps the most inconvenient time possible for both administrations.\n\nPetro is fighting to bring \"total peace\" to Colombia, a campaign promise he made which this year appears to be collapsing with attacks by armed groups mounting in regions such as Catatumbo, Cauca, and Valle del Cauca, and culminating in the assassination of presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay in Bogotá.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is waging a controversial campaign against drug traffickers, and since September, US military vessels have attacked suspected drug boats, killing at least 37 people - 32 in strikes carried out in the Caribbean and five more in the first  such US attacks on two vessels in the Pacific, carried out on Wednesday.\n\nThis campaign has mainly been aimed at vessels alleged to have come from Venezuela, whose president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump accuses of being the leader of the Cartel of the Suns drug gang.\n\nMaduro has vehemently denied the accusation and said the strikes are aimed at ousting him from office.\n\nThe legality of the operations has also been questioned by legal experts who warn that they breach international law.\n\nOne of the most outspoken critics of the US strikes has been President Petro, who has called on the United Nations to open a \"criminal process\" against Trump for the strikes.\n\nNevertheless, both governments appear to need each other, although, in light of the recent tensions, they are also moving towards disengaging from each other.\n\nMr Galeano says that given their opposing views and outspoken style it was clear that relations between Petro and Trump were \"going to explode at any moment, especially after the US bombings of the boats in the Caribbean\".\n\nIn September,  Petro told BBC News  that Trump's attacks on boats were an \"act of tyranny\" and called for US officials to be prosecuted for \"murder\".\n\nLast Saturday, he echoed a report published by state-run media outlet RTVC alleging that a Colombian fisherman named Alejandro Carranza had been killed in a US strike on a boat on 16 September.\n\nHours later, Trump announced the suspension of aid and warned that if Petro did not stamp out drug production in Colombia, the US would do it for him \"and it won't be done nicely\".\n\nAccording to the Colombian Foreign Ministry, this constituted a threat \"to conduct an illegal intervention in Colombian territory\".\n\nMs Dickinson describes the deterioration in US-Colombian relations and the cuts in aid as \"a devastating blow\" and warns that they are likely to \"weaken the ability of security forces to control armed groups\".\n\nShe adds that it is \"difficult to understand\" why the US would take such a decision at a time when tensions are high in the region due to the US deployment in the Caribbean and Trump's declaration of an \"armed conflict\" with drug trafficking groups.\n\n\"Why confront your closest ally when regional security is already at stake?\" Ms Dickinson asks.\n\nMr Galeano also thinks that cracks in the once strong US-Colombian alliance carry risks for both countries.\n\n\"Colombia needs the US, and the US needs Colombia. There are military bases that the US uses in Colombia, with agreements even signed during Petro's administration,\" he explains.\n\n\"In all of this, the criminal gangs win.\"\n\n\"While Trump focusses on the Caribbean, traffickers smuggle drugs through the Pacific, from Ecuador and Colombia, which are reportedly the source of most narcotics shipped out of South America,\" the expert adds.\n\nSince Trump returned to the US presidency in January, the friction between his and Petro's governments has barely let up.\n\nWithin days, the two countries came close to a trade war after Petro turned back a flight carrying Colombian deportees from the US, denouncing the conditions in which they were traveling.\n\nThe trade war was quickly averted after some frantic negotiations, but the crisis set the tone of things to come.\n\nRead:  Co-operate or else: Trump's Colombia face-off is warning to all leaders\n\nWhen Colombian presidential candidate and opposition leader Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot dead in Bogotá in early June, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked his assassination to \"violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government\".\n\nWeeks later, both governments recalled their ambassadors for consultations, a move often interpreted in international relations as preceding the breaking off of bilateral relations.\n\nThe envoys remained in place, but Washington has since dealt further severe blows to the Petro government.\n\nNot only did it formally decertify Colombia as a partner in the war on drugs, but it also revoked Petro's visa after he led a pro-Palestinian protest in New York during his visit there for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nFollowing the suspension of US aid and amid the continuing tense antagonism between Petro and Trump many fear that relationship could deteriorate even further."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qpne1pz3jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"09:11:15.817+00:00","title":"Why has the US imposed sanctions on Russian oil companies?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US, under President Donald Trump, has imposed new sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil—two of Russia's largest oil companies—marking a significant diplomatic and economic shift in the ongoing war with Ukraine.

A summit with Putin in August failed to yield any tangible results, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow.\n\nThe US and its allies have so far been tentative about restricting the Russian energy industry, fearing wider impacts on the global economy.\n\nBut Trump has recently put more pressure on US allies to curb their spending on Russian oil - saying he would only issue sanctions when they did so.\n\nIt was Putin's refusal to end the \"senseless war\" that ultimately prompted the move, Bessent said on Wednesday.\n\nThe news comes a week after the UK imposed similar sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil - and just a day after the White House said a planned follow-up meeting with Putin in Budapest would be shelved.\n\n\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump explained. \"I just felt it was time. We waited a long time.\"\n\nThe impact is being seen as symbolic as well as economic, because Trump has so far pinned his hopes on brokering a peace deal and has resisted issuing sanctions.\n\nTwo former US ambassadors to Ukraine suggested that the significance of the move remained to be seen in the long term.\n\nThe sanctions \"will certainly hurt the Russian economy, which is already stumbling\", Ambassador John Herbst told the BBC. \"But I think it's naive to expect this step alone [will] push Putin to actually make peace and good faith.\"\n\n\"If we want Putin to actually negotiate in good faith, we have to maintain major pressure, economic and military, for many months. But this is a good start.\"\n\nBill Taylor, another former ambassador, told the BBC: \"These sanctions are an indication to President Putin that he has to come to the table.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly endorsed proposals to freeze the fighting along current frontlines, suggesting that territory should be \"cut the way it is\".\n\nRussia has pushed back against that idea, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov indicating Russia had not changed its position of wanting Ukrainian troops to leave the parts of the eastern Donbas region Kyiv still controls.\n\nThese new sanctions, against such a critical pillar of Russia's economy, could push it to reconsider that position. That is what the US is hoping for - though analysts who spoke to the BBC expected little immediate change on the ground.\n\nAccording to Dr Stuart Rollo, a research fellow at the University of Sydney's Centre for International Security Studies, the sanctions serve two primary goals - \"to materially impact Russia's industrial capacity to wage war, and to coerce Russia into accepting peace terms out of fear of the escalating impacts of sanctions on their economy and society\".\n\nDr Rollo added: \"They will not impact the former. They may impact the latter if a deft diplomatic balance is struck between the perceived consequences of continuing the war, and the benefits and concessions that will be furnished through a negotiated peace.\"\n\nMichael Raska, Assistant Professor in the Military Transformations Programme at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said that, in the near term, the sanctions were \"unlikely to alter the military balance in Ukraine\".\n\nBut, he added, \"as profit margins shrink, Russia will face difficult trade-offs between maintaining socio-economic stability, while financing a protracted war\".\n\nThese sanctions are sure to deal a blow to Russia's economy, with taxes from the oil and gas industries accounting for about a quarter of the nation's federal budget.\n\nBut the ripple effects could also be felt much further afield.\n\nOil and gas are Russia's biggest exports - with Moscow's biggest customers including China and India, the world's two most populous countries, and Turkey.\n\nTogether, China and India make up most of Russia's energy exports.\n\nChina last year purchased a record of more than 100 million tonnes of Russian crude oil, which accounted for almost 20% of its total energy imports.\n\nLikewise, oil exports to India, which made up only a small fraction of its imports before the Ukraine war, has since grown to some $140bn (£103.5bn) since 2022.\n\nTrump previously levied a 25% tariff on goods from India as what he called retaliation for such imports.\n\nAlthough Trump said Indian PM Narendra Modi had assured him during a phone call on Tuesday that Delhi \"was not going to buy much oil from Russia\" as he too \"wants to see the war end with Russia-Ukraine\".\n\nTrump is urging these countries to halt purchases of Russian oil altogether, forcing them to find alternative suppliers, possibly at a higher cost.\n\nBut refusal to do so could see China and India attracting secondary sanctions from the US.\n\nEdward Fishman, a former senior US State Department sanctions official, suggested the significance of the new sanctions depends on what happens next.\n\n\"Will the US actively threaten secondary sanctions on the Chinese banks, UAE traders, and Indian refineries that transact with Rosneft/Lukoil?\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"I expect, at the very least, some pullback from dealings with Russian oil in the short term.\"\n\nOn Thursday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Indian state refiners were reviewing their Russian oil trade documents to ensure that no supply would be coming directly from Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nAnd Reliance, Indian's top buyer of Russian oil, also said it was recalibrating its crude imports from Moscow in response to the sanctions.\n\nNews of Trump's sanctions has already caused global oil prices to rise, with Brent - a leading international crude oil benchmark - measuring a 5% surge.\n\nFor comparison, Brent measured a 1.6% rise following the UK's announcement of sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil last week.\n\nThat announcement led the Russian embassy in London to warn that targeting major Russian energy companies would disrupt global fuel supplies and increase costs worldwide - including for families and businesses in the UK.\n\nThose ominous projections don't appear to have materialised to any major degree - and pale in comparison to the uptick measured over the past 24 hours, as Trump's announcement fuels uncertainty.\n\nBut Dr Rollo suggests that, even in this more recent case, the surge is unlikely to continue.\n\n\"In the medium- to long-term, I don't expect that this will impact oil prices globally, unless secondary sanctions on shipping and finance related to these companies come to be strictly enforced,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Hoskins, Osmond Chia and James FitzGerald"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnve5532v7yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"17:49:14.597+00:00","title":"Rosenberg: Trump abandons carrot and wields stick over Putin in Ukraine talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has cancelled a planned US-Russia summit in Budapest, marking a shift from diplomatic 'carrots' to economic 'sticks' by imposing sanctions on major Russian oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil.

The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Budapest.\n\nLast August, amid threats of additional US sanctions against Russia, Putin met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.

The paper criticised \"the capriciousness and fickleness of [Russia's] main negotiating partner.\"\n\nSo what's changed?\n\nInstead of rushing off to summit no. 2, as he had done for summit no.1, this time around President Trump was slightly more cautious.\n\nHe had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay the groundwork for the summit with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to make sure there was a point in decamping to Budapest.\n\nIt soon became clear that there wasn't, and that a new summit now was unlikely to produce a breakthrough.\n\nRussia is fiercely opposed to Donald Trump's idea of freezing the current battle lines in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin is determined to take control, at the very least, of the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It has seized and occupied much of it.\n\nBut President Volodymyr Zelensky is refusing to cede to Russia those parts of the Donbas that Ukraine still controls.\n\nMoscow would have welcomed a second US-Russia summit.\n\nThe first, in Alaska, was a diplomatic and political coup for the Kremlin. The red-carpet welcome in Anchorage for President Putin symbolised Russia's return to the international stage and the West's failure to isolate Moscow.\n\nOver the last week Russian state media have been savouring the idea of a summit with President Trump in Europe, but without the European Union at the table. Russian commentators portrayed the proposed meeting in Budapest as a slap in the face for Brussels.\n\nAt the same time, few here seemed to believe that, even if it went ahead, the Budapest summit would produce the kind of result Moscow wanted.\n\nSome Russian newspapers have been calling for the Russian army to continue fighting.\n\n\"There isn't a single reason Moscow should agree to a ceasefire,\" declared Moskovsky Komsomolets yesterday.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Kremlin doesn't want peace.\n\nIt does. But only on its terms. And right now those are unacceptable to Kyiv and, it would appear, to Washington.\n\nThose terms involve more than just territory. Moscow is demanding that what it calls the \"root causes\" of the Ukraine war be addressed: an all-encompassing phrase with which Russia broaden its demands to include a halt to Nato enlargement eastwards.\n\nMoscow is also widely believed to retain the goal of forcing Ukraine back into Russia's orbit.\n\nIs Donald Trump ready to increase the pressure on Russia even more?\n\nPossibly.\n\nBut it's also possible we may wake up one morning and find ourselves back in Groundhog Day.\n\n\"In the game of Trump tug-of-war, Russia is leading again,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets after the Budapest summit had been announced.\n\n\"In the couple of weeks before the meeting in Budapest, Trump will be pulled in the opposite direction by telephone calls and visits from Europe. Then Putin will pull him back to our side again.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c397jvrrm4mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:17:18.803+00:00","title":"The decades-old exemption that lets Trump reconstruct the White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is planning to demolish the existing structure of the White House East Wing to construct a new ballroom, despite the existence of a nearly-60-year-old legal exemption under Section 107 of the National Historic Preservation Act, which exempts the White House from mandatory review processes.

Over the years, a host of presidents have made renovations, from a bowling alley to an indoor swimming pool.\n\nUnder a law known as National Historic Preservation Act, federal agencies are required to examine the impact of any construction projects on historic properties. Specifically, Section 106 requires the agencies to undergo a review process, including getting input from the public.\n\nThen-President Lyndon B Johnson signed the law in 1966, after a period of rapid development in the US - including through federally-funded infrastructure projects - as concerns grew that cultural and historical landmarks were being destroyed.\n\nAccording to Section 107 of the act, three buildings and their grounds are exempt from the Section 106 review process: the White House, the US Capitol and the US Supreme Court building.\n\nIn the past, however, typically presidents have voluntarily submitted their plans to the National Capital Planning Commission - which oversees federal building construction - before the construction project begins.\n\nTrump officials have not yet done so, but say they plan to, though the renovation has already begun.\n\nPriya Jain, the chair of a heritage preservation committee at the Society of Architectural Historians, told the BBC that the process laid out by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was well established and would have been the \"best practice\" for Trump's East Wing renovation.\n\nThese reviews - which can take years - involves discussions about programmatic requirements and potential alternatives.\n\n\"In this case, it would have been: do we need such a big ballroom? Should it be smaller?\" said Jain, a professor of architecture at Texas A&M University. \"Could it be an extension of the East Wing? Could it have been submerged?\"\n\nAt stake, she said, is the \"history\" that the building contains. All the additions to the White House over time have added to how the public understands the building and the country at that point in time, she said.\n\n\"It's the memory,\" she said. \"The East Wing is 83 years old. It has assumed a historical importance of its own. I haven't seen much out there about how that was assessed.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0kynx59v0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"17:33:44.341+00:00","title":"Met officers sacked for gross misconduct after BBC Panorama Charing Cross investigation","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three Metropolitan Police officers — Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson, and PC Martin Borg — have been dismissed for gross misconduct after being recorded in an undercover BBC Panorama investigation at Charing Cross Police Station.

misconduct after appearing in an undercover report by BBC Panorama.\n\nSgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg faced expedited misconduct hearings on Thursday over secret filming aired in the programme. They denied allegations of gross misconduct but accepted they made the comments aired in the programme.\n\nAllegations against all three were upheld during the hearings, and all were dismissed with immediate effect.\n\nThey are the first of 10 current or former officers to face hearings as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings over footage from the investigation.\n\nChair of the panel, Cdr Jason Prins, described the conduct of all three officers as a \"disgrace\".\n\nHe said it \"must have been obvious\" to them that \"the comments made were abhorrent.\"\n\nHe added that Mr McIlvenny's conduct was \"exacerbated as he was a Police Sergeant and in a leadership position\".\n\nIn a statement following the hearings, Met Police professionalism Cdr Simon Messinger, said the force had upheld a promise to hold misconduct hearings \"at the earliest opportunity\".\n\n\"We have since replaced the custody team at Charing Cross, made changes to local leadership and wider work continues to identify any other areas of concern in detention teams across the Met.\"\n\nSgt Joe McIlvenny had been serving with the Met Police for nearly 20 years when he was secretly recorded being dismissive about a pregnant woman's allegation of rape and domestic violence against her partner.\n\nWhen a detention officer questioned a decision to release the man on bail alleged to have raped the woman, she said he had also been accused of kicking her in the stomach. PS McIlvenny was recorded replying: \"That's what she says.\"\n\nBBC Panorama also filmed the sergeant making misogynistic comments while working at Charing Cross police station.\n\nAt the hearing on Thursday, Mr McIlvenny argued that \"what was missing was the context\" to his comments. He requested to shift to a reduced role in the force after being found of gross misconduct.\n\nHe told the panel since the programme was aired he has been diagnosed with PTSD and was receiving therapy.\n\nReferring to the undercover reporter he said: \"He was a very clever man. He has groomed and exploited my vulnerable state and used that to coerce these conversations.\"\n\nMr Neilson was recorded by the BBC referring to an \"invasion\" of \"scum\" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia.\n\nHe was also observed saying a detainee who had overstayed his visa should have a \"bullet through his head\".\n\nThe other allegations against Mr Neilson related to \"glorifying what he was describing as inappropriate use of force on a restrained detainee\" and for suggesting unlawful violence against migrants who broke the law.\n\nCdr Jason Prins found all the allegations proven.\n\nThe hearing was told that he did not dispute the words he said but argued they only amounted to just misconduct.\n\nGiving evidence, Mr Neilson said he had been a police officer for four years and denied he was a racist.\n\nHe said he believed the undercover reporter \"breached his humans rights\" and it was the reporter who \"kept bringing up these conversations\" and \"egging me on\".\n\nMr Neilson said he had eight or nine pints of Guinness while at the pub when he made some of the comments and said he was not a \"drinker\".\n\nHe said he did not discriminate against anyone and footage from his body worn camera would show \"no matter the ethnicity I did everything with the utmost respect\".\n\nCdr Prins ruled that Mr Neilson's comments caused \"significant harm\" to the reputation of Metropolitan Police and wider public confidence in the police and amounted to gross misconduct, describing the conduct of the officer as an \"utter disgrace\".\n\nThe Met had previously said he had \"displayed extreme racial, violent and discriminatory views\", as well as a lack of \"respect, courtesy and professionalism\".\n\nPC Martin Borg, who worked out of Charing Cross Police station, was also dismissed on Thursday.\n\nAn undercover BBC reporter recorded Mr Borg enthusiastically describing how he saw another officer stomp on a suspect's leg in custody.\n\nThe officer was filmed laughing and saying he had offered to make a statement claiming the suspect had kicked the sergeant first. It is not clear from CCTV footage seen by the BBC whether that was the case.\n\nJames Berry KC, bringing the case for the Met, said the Panorama programme showed Mr Borg \"revelled in the use of force on detainees\" and made a \"number of discriminatory remarks about Muslims\".\n\nMr Borg denied he was a racist and all the allegations of gross misconduct against him, but admitted he made the comments in the programme and argued he had \"been groomed over a series of months to get the undercover report\".\n\nHe faced a total of eight allegations, of which five were found proven as gross misconduct by the panel.\n\nChair Cdr Jason Prins described Mr Borg's conduct as a \"disgrace\", adding: \"He alone was responsible for the comments and it was or must have been obvious to him his comments were abhorrent.\n\n\"The comments caused significant harm to the reputation of the Metropolitan Police and public confidence in policing more generally.\"\n\nSeven more officers are to face misconduct hearings over the next week, the Met said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1rrzn1kwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:16:22.355+00:00","title":"Soft Cell's musical force Dave Ball dies, aged 66","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dave Ball, the keyboardist and co-founder of the influential 1980s synth-pop duo Soft Cell, has died at the age of 66.

Dave Ball dies, aged 66\n\nIn 1981, an unlikely group from Leeds scored a number one hit with their icy cover version of an obscure 60s soul hit.\n\nWith Tainted Love, Soft Cell set a template for 80s synth-pop duos: The flamboyant frontman paired with an unassuming keyboard technician.\n\nDave Ball, who has died at the age of 66, was that musical force, creating ominous, polyphonic soundscapes to match Marc Almond's lyrics about X-rated movies and sado-masochism.\n\nTainted Love sold more than 21 million copies across the world and was followed by hits such as Say Hello, Wave Goodbye and Torch, before the band split in 1984. Reunited in the 2000s, they had completed a new album in the days before Ball's death.\n\nIn a statement, the musician's family said he had died peacefully in his sleep at his home in London on Wednesday 22 October.\n\nIt comes less than two months after Soft Cell played a headline show to 20,000 fans at the Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames.\n\nDuring that concert, Ball performed in a wheelchair, as he had for the last two years, following a spate of ill-health.\n\n\"I managed to damage myself quite a bit,\"  he told the Yorkshire Post in 2023 . \"I fractured lower vertebrae in my spine and cracked about five ribs and broke my wrist\".\n\nAfter catching pneumonia and developing sepsis, he was placed in an induced coma and remained in hospital for seven months.\n\nHowever, he had been in \"a great place emotionally\" over the summer, as he worked on Soft Cell's new album, Danceteria, which is scheduled for release next year.\n\n\"He was focused and so happy with the new album that we literally completed only a few days ago,\" said Almond in a tribute.\n\n\"It's so sad as 2026 was all set to be such an uplifting year for him, and I take some solace from the fact that he heard the finished record and felt that it was a great piece of work.\"\n\nAlmond has thanked his bandmate for \"being an immense part of my life and for the music you gave me\", adding: \"I wouldn't be where I am without you.\"\n\nBall had also been part of the pioneering techno duo The Grid, who scored a UK top 10 hit in 1994 with the banjo-powered Swamp Thing.\n\nHis bandmate from that era, Richard Norris, also paid tribute, remembering Ball's \"endless laughter\" and \"unwavering friendship\".\n\n\"Being in a duo with someone is different from being in a band, the bond is very tight,\" he added.\n\n\"That's how it was with us. We went through so many remarkable, extraordinary, life-affirming experiences together. Thank you, Dave.\"\n\nBorn into a single-parent household in Chester in 1959, Ball was given up for adoption when he was 18 months old.\n\nHe grew up in Blackpool with adoptive parents Donald and Brenda Ball, who changed his first name from Paul to David, alongside his younger sister Susan, who was also adopted.\n\nHe met Almond at Leeds Polytechnic in 1977, where they were both studying art. Fuelled by a shared love of Northern Soul, they formed Soft Cell the same year, and quickly recorded an EP, which was given early airtime by Radio 1's John Peel.\n\nThey were an unusual pairing: Ball was quietly hunched over his keyboard, while Almond was a flamboyant showman, all glitter and eye-liner; but they achieved a rare musical alchemy.\n\nBall had developed a fascination with synthesizers after watching Kraftwerk appear on BBC science show Tomorrow's World, and began to marry dark electronica to the soaring melodies Almond was writing.\n\nTainted Love became the UK's second biggest-selling single of 1981, shifting 21 million copies worldwide. Alongside hits by Gary Numan, Human League and Ultravox, it helped paved the way for the synth-pop sound of the 80s.\n\nThe song was also included on their full-length debut, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, which spawned two further top five singles: Bedsitter and Say Hello, Wave Goodbye.\n\nThey followed the album with the stand-alone single, Torch, which peaked at number two in 1982.\n\nFame had its upsides. \"I loved being able to afford my first home, having money and travelling, which makes me sound like a Miss World,\" Ball recently told Classic Pop Magazine.\n\nBut it also presented problems. \"Newfound wealth meant we could afford newfound drugs to relieve the boredom\" of media interviews and TV performances, Ball said.\n\n\"I know that's a cliché, but it's a cliché for a good reason, because it works for so many bands.\"\n\nAmidst the hedonistic lifestyle, the duo were also drifting apart, but they managed to create a second classic album - the wayward, tense and aptly-titled The Art Of Falling Apart.\n\nThey released one more album, 1984's This Last Night In Sodom, before dissolving the band to concentrate on other projects.\n\nAlmond went on to have a successful solo career, including the top 10 hit Something's Got A Hold Of My Heart; while Ball created The Grid, who mixed acid house with ambient pop over a long-lasting collaboration.\n\nSoft Cell reunited in 2001, producing the Top 40 album Cruelty Without Beauty.\n\nAfter another hiatus, they reappeared in 2018, releasing the original singles Northern Lights and Guilty (Cos I Say You Are) before performing what was supposed to be a farewell show at the O2 Arena on 30 September, 2018.\n\nHowever, they remained together, recording their fifth album, Happiness Not Included, during the 2020 Covid lockdown.\n\nBall recently described the band's new music as a tribute to the New York club scene they frequented while recording their first two albums.\n\nHe added that his time in hospital had influenced the band's sound.\n\n\"I had strange recollections when I was in and out of hospital because I was on morphine,\" he told Classic Pop.\n\n\"The new songs are a digital reflection of the sounds in my head from that time.\n\n\"In parallel, it's about the times me and Marc got up to in the 80s.\"\n\nThe final mixes were completed only days before Ball died. It is due for release in Spring 2026."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvzxnzjzzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:15:20.252+00:00","title":"France: Museum robbery sees 2,000 gold and silver coins stolen","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, France faced a wave of museum heists, beginning with a brazen daylight robbery of €88 million worth of crown jewels from the Louvre Museum, followed by the theft of 2,000 gold and silver coins from the Maison des Lumières in Landres.

(£78,000; $104,000) were stolen during a raid at another French museum - just hours after the audacious theft of some of the French crown jewels at the Louvre in Paris.\n\nThe incident happened at a museum dedicated to French philosopher Denis Diderot in Landres, north-eastern France on Sunday night.\n\nWhen the Maison des Lumières (House of Enlightenment) opened on Tuesday, workers noticed a smashed display case and raised the alarm, officials said. The coins were selected with \"great expertise\", a statement to French media from the local authority said.\n\nIt is the latest in a recent string of heists at cultural institutions across France.\n\nThe stolen coins date from between 1790 and 1840 and are part of the city's private collection, after being discovered in 2011 during renovation work at the building that now houses the museum, according to local media.\n\nLast month, criminals broke into Paris's Natural History Museum, making off with six gold nuggets worth around €1.5m.\n\nA Chinese national  was arrested in Barcelona in connection with this raid while trying to dispose of some melted down gold , according to prosecutors. She was charged earlier this month and is being held in pre-trial detention.\n\nAlso in September, thieves stole two Chinese porcelain dishes and a vase with an estimated combined worth of €6.55m from the national porcelain museum in the central city of Limoges. The items are still missing and no arrests have been made.\n\n\"They're unsaleable on the art market. The pieces are too easily traceable anyway because they're so well listed,\" a ceramics expert told Le Parisien newspaper at the time.\n\nThe heist that has made headlines across the globe was the brazen daylight robbery of €88m worth of historic jewellery from the Louvre museum in Paris.\n\nA gang disguised as workers used power-tools and a mechanical ladder to gain access to the first-floor Gallery of Apollo in the world's most visited museum shortly after it opened on Sunday.\n\nThe loot included a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, and several pieces previously owned by Queen Marie-Amelie.\n\nArt detective Arthur Brand told the BBC museums across Europe could see a flurry of copycat raids in the coming months.\n\nIf someone can target the Louvre and escape with the French crown jewels, local thieves may think \"let's try our nearest museum\", he said.\n\nSecurity is clearly a problem for many cultural institutions, he said, before adding that compared to a heavily protected jewellery store, a museum with lax security and unarmed guards is a ripe target for robbers.\n\nThe Louvre heist - as well as the other incidents - have raised concerns in France around the lax security at institutions that house some of its most prized treasures.\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since the heist, the Louvre's director Laurence des Cars told French senators on Wednesday that  CCTV around the Louvre's perimeter was weak and \"aging\" .\n\nThe only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where the theives broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to the gallery housing the jewels, she said.\n\n\"We failed these jewels,\" des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\n\nA preliminary report found one in three rooms in the Louvre lacked CCTV and that its wider alarm system did not go off.\n\nJustice Minister Gérald Darmanin said security protocols had \"failed\", lamenting that the thieves being able to drive a modified truck up to the museum had left France with a \"terrible image\".\n\nIn the case of the gold stolen from the French Natural History Museum, the building's alarm and surveillance systems had been disabled by a cyber-attack, with the thieves apparently aware of this, French media reported at the time."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-betting-scheme-indictment.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"EPA Faces Legal Challenge Over Environmental Enforcement","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent legal case involving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in California has drawn significant attention due to allegations of inadequate enforcement of environmental regulations.

The NBA maintained codes of conduct applicable to its players, coaches and\n\n2\n\nmanagement that prohibited, among other things, wagering in connection with NBA games or\nproviding non-public information relating to NBA games to others. Such codes of conduct also required NBA players, coaches and management to provide their best services and loyalty to\n\ntheir teams.\n\n8. NBA teams were required to report to the NBA information concerning player injuries, illnesses and rest for all NBA games. On each gameday, the NBA disseminated an \"injury report” for each NBA team playing that day. The injury reports identified players as falling within one of the following categories: \"available,\" \"probable,\" \"questionable,\" “doubtful\" and \"out.” The injury reports were updated multiple times throughout each gameday.\n\n9.\n\nBetting Companies 1 through 4, entities the identities of which are known\nto the Grand Jury, were licensed gambling companies operating in the United States that offered sports betting services (collectively, and together with other online sportsbooks and retail sportsbooks, the \"Betting Companies\"). The Betting Companies offered sports betting services relating to, among other things, NBA games and individual players' statistical performances in NBA games.

The four excepted states-Nevada, Oregon, Delaware and Montana had existing sports wagering regimes that PASPA grandfathered in.\n23. In or about 2018, following years of litigation between the State of New Jersey—which desired to legalize sports betting—and several major American professional and college sports leagues, the United States Supreme Court struck down PASPA as unconstitutional. In the ensuing years, sports betting, and particularly online sports betting, became legal in dozens of states.\n24. The Betting Companies operated online mobile applications, branded retail sportsbooks at various casinos nationwide, or both. Online wagers made through the Betting Companies' online mobile applications were made pursuant to the Betting Companies' respective terms of use. Wagers made at retail sportsbooks were made pursuant to the sportsbooks' house rules. Among other things, the terms of use and house rules generally prohibited users from wagering in connection with sporting contests when the wagers were based on or the users had access to pre-release, confidential information or other non-public information. The terms of use and house rules also prohibited individuals from using others to place wagers on their behalf, otherwise known as straw betting.\n\n25.\n\nDespite the recent widespread legalization of sports betting, unlicensed\n\nbookmakers or “bookies” also offered sports betting services to bettors. Bookies frequently\n\naccepted bets on bespoke betting websites that allowed users to place various types of wagers on\n\n5\n\nsporting contests based on publicly available betting lines. Unlike legal sportsbooks, bookies\ntypically \"settled up” the bettors' wagers (i.e., received payment from and/or paid the bettors in connection with the wagers) offline, generally through cash, peer-to-peer payments or\n\ncryptocurrency transactions.\n\n26.\n\nA \"proposition\" or \"prop\" bet was a bet made regarding the occurrence or non-occurrence during a game of an event not directly affecting the game's outcome. For example, a bettor might wager that a particular player would score more (referred to as betting the \"over\") or fewer (referred to as betting the \"under\") points than a certain number of points designated by the betting operator for a given game. Prop bets took many forms. For example, a bettor could place prop bets on the points, rebounds, assists, minutes played and/or three- pointers made by individual NBA players.\n\n27.\n\nA \"money line\" bet was a bet placed on a game's outcome (i.e., which\n\nteam would win or lose the game). Relatedly, a \"point spread” or “spread\" bet was a bet placed\n\non the margin of victory or defeat in a given game.\n\n28.\n\nA \"parlay\" bet was a bet that was comprised of two or more individual bets (as opposed to a \"single\" or \"straight” bet, which was comprised of one individual bet). For a bettor to win a parlay bet, each bet, or “leg,” within the parlay bet had to be successful. 29. A \"betting line\" or \"line\" was a number set by oddsmakers to represent the\nexpected outcome of a particular event. In the context of prop bets, a betting line was the number set by oddsmakers for a given outcome. For example, an oddsmaker might set the betting line for a given player's points in a given game at 20. Bettors would then have the choice to bet the \"under\" (i.e., that the player will score fewer than 20 points in the game), or the \"over\" (i.e., that the player will score more than 20 points). Oddsmakers had proprietary\n\n6\n\nprocesses for setting betting lines, but betting lines generally took into account all publicly\n\nknown information relevant to a given bet.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Fraudulent Wagering Scheme\n\n30. In or about and between December 2022 and March 2024, the defendants ERIC EARNEST, MARVES FAIRLEY, SHANE HENNEN, DAMON JONES, DENIRO LASTER and TERRY ROZIER, together with others, participated in a scheme to defraud the Betting Companies by providing, obtaining and using non-public information relating to NBA games to place and cause others to place fraudulent sports wagers for profit, and to launder the proceeds thereof.\n\n31.\n\nThe fraudulent wagering scheme typically involved various iterations of the same pattern within a network of co-conspirators. The defendants and certain co- conspirators had access to private information known by NBA players or NBA coaches that was likely to affect the outcome of upcoming NBA games or individual players' performances. They provided other co-conspirators this non-public information-in exchange for either a flat fee or a share in expected wagering profits-for the purpose of betting. The co-conspirators disseminated the non-public betting information through a network of individuals who placed bets on the co-conspirators' behalf, placed wagers on their own behalf, or directed others to place wagers, all with the intention of profiting off the scheme at the expense of the Betting Companies. As a result, many of the wagers were placed in connection with betting lines that did not reflect or account for the private information known by the defendants and their co- conspirators, rendering the wagers more profitable.\n\n32.\n\nThe defendants and their co-conspirators placed and caused others to place these fraudulent wagers through the Betting Companies' mobile applications and retail\n\n7\n\nsportsbooks. In doing so, the defendants and their co-conspirators made and caused others to make materially false and misleading statements and representations to the Betting Companies, and to omit to state one or more material facts which made what was represented under the circumstances misleading, including that the wagers were placed in accordance with the Betting Companies' terms and conditions and house rules prohibiting, among other things, wagering based on non-public information and straw betting.\n33. In many instances, the defendants and their co-conspirators' fraudulent bets were successful and were paid out by the Betting Companies. The Betting Companies would not have paid bettors for successful wagers had they known that the bettors possessed non-public information pertaining to the event or were placing the wagers at the direction of and for the benefit of others.\n\n34.\n\nIn furtherance of the scheme and to conceal the proceeds derived from it,\nthe defendants and their co-conspirators engaged in and caused others to engage in transactions between and among themselves and others acting on their behalf including peer-to-peer payment\nplatform transfers, bank wires and cash exchanges.\n\n35.\n\nExamples of some of the fraudulent wagers and the laundering of proceeds\n\nthereof are set forth below.\n\nA.\n\nThe March 23, 2023 Charlotte Hornets Game\n\n36.\n\nDuring the 2022-2023 NBA season, the defendant TERRY ROZIER played for the Charlotte Hornets. Prior to the Hornets' March 23, 2023 game against the New Orleans Pelicans (the \"March 23 Game”), ROZIER informed the defendant DENIRO LASTER that ROZIER was going to prematurely remove himself from the game in the first quarter due to a supposed injury and not return to play further. ROZIER provided this information to\n\n8\n\nLASTER for the purpose of enabling LASTER to place wagers based on this information.\nROZIER was not on the Hornets' injury report prior to the March 23 Game and Hornets officials were not aware of ROZIER's plan to exit the game prematurely. The public, including the Betting Companies, was also not aware of ROZIER's plan to exit the March 23 Game\n\nprematurely.\n\n37. The defendant DENIRO LASTER sold the information about the\ndefendant TERRY ROZIER's plan to leave the March 23 Game early to multiple co- conspirators, including to the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY and Co-Conspirator 1, to enable them to place fraudulent wagers based on the non-public information. In exchange for the information, FAIRLEY and Co-Conspirator 1 agreed to pay LASTER approximately $100,000 from their expected fraudulent gambling winnings. Prior to the March 23 Game, FAIRLEY, LASTER and Co-Conspirator 1 exchanged text messages confirming that ROZIER planned to exit the game prematurely and confirming their plan to place wagers on ROZIER's unders (i.e., that ROZIER would underperform relative to the oddsmakers' betting lines for his individual performance).\n38. The defendant MARVES FAIRLEY also provided the information to the defendant SHANE HENNEN so that HENNEN, both himself and through a network of straw bettors, could place bets on the defendant TERRY ROZIER's unders. FAIRLEY provided the information to HENNEN and HENNEN agreed to place and direct his associates to place bets on ROZIER's unders based on an agreement between them that HENNEN would give FAIRLEY a share of the profits from his and his associates' winning bets.\n\n39.\n\nOn or about March 23, 2023 and prior to the start of the March 23 Game,\n\nthe defendant SHANE HENNEN placed multiple bets at a retail sportsbook operated by Betting\n\n9\n\nCompany 3 totaling approximately $61,200, all of which were either straight or parlay bets on the defendant TERRY ROZIER's unders. In addition to placing bets on ROZIER's unders himself, HENNEN marshalled a network of associates to place bets on ROZIER's unders at HENNEN's direction, including, but not limited to, the following bets, all of which were placed on or about March 23, 2023, prior to the start of the March 23 Game:\n\n(a)\n\nCo-Conspirator 2 placed multiple straight or parlay bets on\n\nROZIER's unders at a retail sportsbook operated by Betting Company 1 and on Betting\n\nCompany 1's mobile application totaling approximately $107,000.\n\n(b)\n\nTimothy McCormack and Long Phi Pham placed multiple straight or parlay bets on ROZIER's unders at a retail sportsbook located in New Jersey and operated by Betting Company 1 and on Betting Company 1's mobile application totaling approximately $41,000. Hours earlier, McCormack received two payments totaling approximately $40,000 via a peer-to-peer mobile payment platform that McCormack and Pham used to fund the above- described wagers on ROZIER's unders. While located within the Eastern District of New York, Pham, among other things, engaged in communications regarding and in furtherance of the fraudulent wagering scheme.\n\n(c)\n\nCo-Conspirator 3 placed multiple straight or parlay bets on\n\nROZIER's unders at a retail sportsbook operated by Betting Company 1 and on Betting\n\nCompany 1's mobile application totaling approximately $20,000.\n\n(d)\n\nCo-Conspirator 4 placed multiple straight bets on ROZIER's\n\nunders at a retail sportsbook operated by Betting Company 1 and on Betting Company l's\n\nmobile application totaling approximately $17,000.\n\n10\n\n(e)\n\nCo-Conspirator 5 placed multiple straight bets on ROZIER'S\n\nunders at a retail sportsbook operated by Betting Company 4 totaling approximately $12,500.\n40. In addition to the defendants and their co-conspirators, others in the defendant TERRY ROZIER's close circle placed wagers on ROZIER's unders in connection\n\nwith the March 23 Game. For example:\n\n(a)\n\nCo-Conspirator 6 placed an approximately $800 bet using Betting\nCompany 1's mobile application on ROZIER's under points. Since approximately 2022, Co- Conspirator 6 has placed dozens of bets on ROZIER's performances in various NBA games via Betting Company 1. Every one of those bets-with the exception of the under bet on ROZIER's points in connection with the March 23 Game-was an over bet. Co-Conspirator 6’s bet on ROZIER's unders was successful and Co-Conspirator 6 was paid approximately $1,500 by Betting Company 1. In the days following the March 23 Game, Co-Conspirator 6 placed multiple additional bets using Betting Company 1's mobile application and lost approximately $4,000. Following that string of losses, Co-Conspirator 6 texted the defendant DENIRO LASTER, \"I lost that shit on [Betting Company 1] ima give you a lite sack when I see u❞ and LASTER responded, “Bet.”\n\n(b)\n\nOn or about the morning of March 23, 2023, a relative of LASTER\ncreated an online account with Betting Company 1 and shortly thereafter placed an approximately $4,000 parlay wager on ROZIER's unders for the March 23 Game. This wager\nwas funded by Co-Conspirator 7-who on prior occasions in the context of discussing sports\n\nbetting, had asked for and received from LASTER non-public information relating to ROZIER'S\n\nhealth status.\n\n11\n\n41.\n\nDuring the March 23 Game, the defendant TERRY ROZIER removed himself from the game in the first quarter and did not return. ROZIER played approximately nine minutes and 34 seconds, well below his season average of approximately 35.3 minutes per game. ROZIER scored five points, recorded two assists and made one three-point shot, which were all well below his per-game averages of approximately 21.1 points, 5.1 assists and 2.6 three-pointers and below the lines set by oddsmakers for ROZIER's points, assists and three- pointers in the March 23 Game. ROZIER collected four rebounds, which was in line with his per-game average of approximately 4.1 rebounds and above the line set by oddsmakers for ROZIER's rebounds in the March 23 Game. ROZIER's early exit from the March 23 Game and his related underperformance relative to his season averages for points, assists and three-pointers resulted in the success of numerous fraudulent wagers placed on ROZIER's unders by the defendants and their co-conspirators.\n42. On or about March 28, 2023, the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to collect proceeds from the defendant SHANE HENNEN from the successful wagers HENNEN and his associates placed on the March 23 Game, as well as proceeds from other fraudulent wagers FAIRLEY and HENNEN made in connection with the fraudulent wagering scheme. On or about March 28, 2023, the defendant DENIRO LASTER also traveled to Philadelphia to collect from FAIRLEY proceeds from the fraudulent wagering scheme relating to the defendant TERRY ROZIER's performance in the March 23 Game. ROZIER arranged and paid for LASTER's travel to Philadelphia. In or about and between the late-night hours of March 28, 2023 and the early morning hours of March 29, 2023, FAIRLEY gave LASTER tens of thousands of dollars in cash as payment for the non-public information\n\n12\n\nthat LASTER had obtained from ROZIER and had provided to FAIRLEY regarding ROZIER's\n\nplan to exit prematurely from the March 23 Game.\n\n43.\n\nAfter the defendant DENIRO LASTER collected his cut of the fraudulent\nwagering scheme proceeds from the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY, LASTER drove from Philadelphia to the defendant TERRY ROZIER's home in Charlotte, North Carolina. LASTER arrived in Charlotte on or about March 30, 2023 and met ROZIER at his home that day. During\nthe early morning hours of April 1, 2023, LASTER and ROZIER counted the money that\n\nLASTER had obtained from FAIRLEY in Philadelphia.\n\nB.\n\nThe March 24, 2023 Portland Trail Blazers Game\n\n44.\n\nOn or about March 24, 2023, the Portland Trail Blazers played the Chicago Bulls (the “March 24 Game\"). Prior to the game, the Trail Blazers' record was 32-40 and the team was out of playoff contention with only 10 games remaining in the season. Prior to the March 24 Game, Co-Conspirator 8 told the defendant ERIC EARNEST that the Trail Blazers were going to be tanking (i.e., intentionally losing) to increase their odds of getting a better draft pick in the upcoming NBA draft. Co-Conspirator 8 told EARNEST, before the news was publicly announced, that several of the Trail Blazers' best players, including Player 1, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, would not be playing in the March 24 Game. The information that the Trail Blazers would be tanking and not playing Player 1 was not available to the public, including the Betting Companies.\n45. Prior to the March 24 Game, the defendant ERIC EARNEST provided this non-public inside information to the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY so that FAIRLEY could place fraudulent wagers on the game and share the profits with EARNEST. In exchange, FAIRLEY ultimately promised to pay EARNEST at least $5,000 if the bets against the Trail\n\n13\n\nBlazers were successful. In addition, FAIRLEY texted EARNEST a screenshot of a purported\n\n$20,000 wire transfer from FAIRLEY's bank account to EARNEST, accompanied by the\n\nmessage \"Address for wire.\"\n\n46. After the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY learned from the defendant\nERIC EARNEST that the Trail Blazers planned not to play their best players in the March 24 Game, FAIRLEY conveyed that non-public information to Co-Conspirator 1. FAIRLEY and Co-Conspirator 1 agreed to split the profits on successful wagers they could place against the Trail Blazers.\n\n47.\n\nBefore these key Trail Blazers players were publicly ruled out of the March 24 Game, the defendants MARVES FAIRLEY and SHANE HENNEN, themselves and together with their co-conspirators including Co-Conspirator 1, placed and caused the placement of multiple bets that the Trail Blazers would lose the March 24 Game totaling more than approximately $100,000. For example, between approximately 12:00 p.m. EST and 7:00 p.m. EST on March 24, 2023, which was before the key Trail Blazers players were publicly ruled out, Timothy McCormack and Long Phi Pham, acting together and with Pham acting at HENNEN's direction, placed bets against the Trail Blazers of approximately $20,000 through Betting Company 1's mobile application and approximately $12,000 through Betting Company 2's mobile application.\n48. The NBA injury reports publicly released at approximately 1:30 p.m. EST and 2:30 p.m. EST on March 24, 2023 reported that Player 1 was, respectively, “probable” and then \"questionable” to play in the March 24 Game. At approximately 9:30 p.m. EST on March 24, 2023-approximately half an hour before the start of the March 24 Game-the NBA released an injury report listing Player 1 and others as “out” for the game. The “out” group\n\n14\n\nincluded the Trail Blazers' four highest per-game scorers during the 2022-2023 season. The\nbetting lines relating to the March 24 Game changed upon the public release of the Trail Blazers' key players' injury statuses.\n49. The fraudulent wagers against the Trail Blazers placed and caused by the defendants MARVES FAIRLEY and SHANE HENNEN, together with co-conspirators acting at\ntheir direction were successful, as the Bulls beat the Trail Blazers 124-96.\n\nC.\n\nThe April 6, 2023 Orlando Magic Game\n\n50.\n\n51.\n\nOn or about April 6, 2023, the Orlando Magic played the Cleveland Cavaliers (the \"April 6 Game”). The defendant MARVES FAIRLEY and Co-Conspirator 1 leveraged Co-Conspirator 1's personal relationship with one of the Magic's regularly starting players, Player 2, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, to obtain non-public information about the April 6 Game which they used to place at least one successful wager. Hours before the April 6 Game, Player 2 told Co-Conspirator 1, before the news was publicly announced, that the Magic would not be playing its entire regular starting lineup (i.e., the team's best players) in the April 6 Game. After receiving this information, Co- Conspirator 1 provided this information to the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY. At the time that Co-Conspirator 1 shared this information with FAIRLEY, the Magic were favored to win the game by approximately nine points. Shortly thereafter, FAIRLEY placed an approximately $11,000 wager with an unlicensed bookmaker that the Cavaliers would cover the game's spread of 9.5 points, that is, the bet would be successful if the Cavaliers won the game outright or lost the game by nine points or fewer.\n\n52.\n\nThe Magic did not play its entire regular starting lineup in the April 6\n\nGame and the betting lines changed upon the public release of information relating to the\n\n15\n\nMagic's starting lineup. The Cavaliers beat the Magic by 24 points in the April 6 Game, thus\n\nrendering FAIRLEY and Co-Conspirator 1's fraudulent bet against the Magic successful.\n\nD.\n\nThe February 9, 2023 and January 15, 2024 Los Angeles Lakers Games\n\n53. The defendant DAMON JONES was a former NBA player and assistant coach. JONES played in the NBA from approximately 1999 through 2008, including as a member of the Cavaliers from approximately 2005 through 2008. JONES was an assistant coach on the Cavaliers from approximately 2014 through 2018. JONES was also an unofficial assistant coach on the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2022-2023 NBA season. During many of those years, JONES was a teammate or coach of a prominent NBA player (\"Player 3\"), an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury.\n54. By virtue of his relationship with Player 3, the Lakers and other NBA personnel, the defendant DAMON JONES had access to non-public information, including medical information that had not been released to the public. On multiple occasions during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 NBA seasons, including as early as approximately December 2022, JONES sold or attempted to sell for profit non-public information to others, including to the defendants ERIC EARNEST and MARVES FAIRLEY and others, for the purpose of causing or enabling them to place fraudulent wagers based on the non-public information.\n\n55.\n\nFor example, on or about February 9, 2023, the Lakers played the Milwaukee Bucks (the \"February 9 Game”). On the morning of the February 9 Game, the defendant DAMON JONES sent a text message to Co-Conspirator 9, writing: “Get a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out! [Player 3] is out tonight. Bet enough so Djones can eat to [sic] now!!!\" At the time JONES provided this non-public information about Player 3 to Co-Conspirator 9, Player 3 was not ruled out on the NBA's injury report for the\n\n16\n\nFebruary 9 Game. Due to a lower body injury, Player 3 did not play in the February 9 Game, which the Lakers lost.\n\n56.\n\nOn multiple other occasions during the 2023-2024 NBA season, including\nin connection with a January 15, 2024 game between the Lakers and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the \"January 15 Game”), the defendants DAMON JONES and ERIC EARNEST sold or attempted to sell to the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY non-public information for the purpose of causing or enabling FAIRLEY to place wagers based on the non-public information. In exchange, FAIRLEY agreed to pay JONES via EARNEST.\n\n57.\n\nPlayer 4, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was\none of the Lakers' best players during the 2023-2024 NBA season. Prior to the January 15 Game, the defendant DAMON JONES claimed to have learned from the trainer for Players 3 and 4 that Player 4 was injured and was only going to play a limited number of minutes and/or his performance would likely be affected in the game because of the injury. JONES shared this non-public information with the defendant ERIC EARNEST, who then sent a text message to the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY stating, \"Hit me asap got one for u dude say he got some info.\" EARNEST then shared the non-public information about Player 4 with FAIRLEY. FAIRLEY paid JONES approximately $2,500, through an intermediary, via a peer-to-peer mobile payment platform, accompanied by the message: \"fee.\"\n58. After receiving this non-public information and before the January 15, 2024 game began, the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY shared the information with Co- Conspirator 1 and the defendant SHANE HENNEN. FAIRLEY and Co-Conspirator 1 then placed and caused the placement of multiple bets against the Lakers. For example, FAIRLEY placed an approximately $100,000 bet against the Lakers at a retail sportsbook operated by\n\n17\n\nBetting Company 2. Hours before the January 15 Game, the NBA injury report listed Player 4\nas \"probable,\" and it was not publicly disseminated, including to the Betting Companies, that Player 4 would possibly play a limited number of minutes and/or poorly due to injury.\n\n59.\n\nUltimately, Player 4 played in the January 15 Game in line with his season average in minutes and performed well, and the Lakers won the game. After the January 15 Game, the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY requested, via the defendant ERIC EARNEST, that the defendant DAMON JONES repay FAIRLEY the $2,500 that FAIRLEY had paid for the non- public information. Despite the Lakers winning the January 15 Game, JONES reaffirmed to EARNEST after the game, including via text message, that he had received credible non-public information regarding Player 4 prior to the game.\n\nE.\n\nThe January 26, 2024 and March 20, 2024 Toronto Raptors Games\n\n60.\n\nOn or about January 26, 2024 and March 20, 2024, the Toronto Raptors played the Los Angeles Clippers (the \"January 26 Game\") and the Sacramento Kings (the\n\n\"March 20 Game\"), respectively.\n\n61.\n\nPrior to the January 26 Game and the March 20 Game, Jontay Porter, then\na player on the Raptors, agreed with Long Phi Pham and others to exit the game prematurely, on the basis of purported injuries, so that certain of their co-conspirators could place fraudulent\n\nwagers on Porter's unders.\n\n62. Prior to both the January 26 Game and the March 20 Game, Pham provided the non-public information about Porter to the defendant SHANE HENNEN for the purpose of causing or enabling HENNEN to place fraudulent wagers based on the non-public information. After obtaining this non-public information, HENNEN shared this information with the defendant MARVES FAIRLEY for the purpose of causing or enabling FAIRLEY to\n\n18\n\nplace additional fraudulent wagers based on the non-public information. After obtaining the non-public information relating to Porter's plan to exit the January 26 Game and the March 20 Game early, HENNEN placed and directed and caused a number of his associates to place wagers on Porter's unders, all of which were successful. HENNEN conducted multiple\ntransfers via peer-to-peer mobile payment platforms to promote the scheme and distribute the proceeds of such wagers.\n\n63.\n\nCOUNT ONE\n\n(Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud)\n\nThe allegations contained in paragraphs one through 62 are realleged and\n\nincorporated as if fully set forth in this paragraph.\n\n64.

The defendants and their co-conspirators carried out the Rigged Poker Scheme by manipulating certain poker games at otherwise non-rigged, or “straight,” illegal poker games, including weekly poker games occurring at locations on Washington Place (the \"Washington Place Game\") and Lexington Avenue (the \"Lexington Avenue Game”) in Manhattan, New York. The Washington Place Game and Lexington Avenue Game were “on record” with, and operated\n\n2\n\nwith the express permission and approval of, members and associates of certain organized crime families of La Cosa Nostra, who provided support and protection for the games and collected owed debts from the games in exchange for a portion of the illegal gambling proceeds.\n\n2.\n\nVictims of the Rigger Poker Scheme (the “Victims”) believed they were participating in \"straight” illegal poker games and that they were gambling against other participants on equal footing. In reality, however, the defendants and their co-conspirators, who constituted the remaining participants purportedly playing in the poker games, worked together on cheating teams (collectively, the “Cheating Teams”) that used advanced wireless technologies to read the cards dealt in each poker hand and relay that information to the defendants and co- conspirators participating in the illegal poker games (collectively, the \"Rigged Games”). The defendants and their co-conspirators then bet accordingly to ensure that the unsuspecting Victims lost money. Through the Rigged Poker Scheme, the defendants and their co-conspirators defrauded Victims of millions of dollars.\n\n3.\n\nTHE DEFENDANTS\n\nThe defendant ERNEST AIELLO was a resident of Wantagh, New York,\nand a member of the Bonanno Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra (the \"Bonanno Crime Family\"). 4.

The defendant MICHAEL RENZULLI was a resident of Islip, New York,\n\nand a member of the Cheating Teams.\n\n28. The defendant ANGELO RUGGIERO, JR. was a resident of Howard\n\nBeach, New York, and was a member of the Gambino Crime Family.\n\n29. The defendant ANTHONY SHNAYDERMAN, also known as \"Doc,\" was\na resident of Brooklyn, New York. SHNAYDERMAN laundered criminal proceeds from the Rigged Poker Scheme.\n\n30.\n\nThe defendant ROBERT STROUD, also known as \"Black Rob,\" was a\nresident of Kentucky. STROUD organized Rigged Games, provided cheating technology to other participants in the Scheme to use in Rigged Games in exchange for a portion of the criminal proceeds, and was also a member of the Cheating Teams.\n31. The defendant SETH TRUSTMAN was a resident of Queens, New York,\nan associate of the Lucchese Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra and a member of the Cheating Teams. TRUSTMAN was an organizer of the Lexington Avenue Game and, with others,\n\n6\n\norganized Rigged Games and illegal poker games at the Lexington Avenue Game, among other\n\nplaces.\n\n32.\n\nThe defendant SOPHIA WEI, also known as \"Pookie,\" was a resident of\n\nQueens, New York, and a member of the Cheating Teams.\n\n33.\n\nThe defendant JULIUS ZILIANI, also known as “Jay,\" was a resident of\n\nNew Jersey and a member of the Bonanno Crime Family.\n\nTHE RIGGED POKER SCHEME\n\n34. The defendants AMMAR AWAWDEH, ZHEN HU, ROBERT STROUD\nand SETH TRUSTMAN, together with others, organized and participated in Rigged Games, as well as \"square\" illegal poker games at various locations in New York City, including the Washington Place Game and the Lexington Avenue Game, and at other locations throughout the United States including East Hampton, New York.\n\n35.\n\nThe defendants TONY GOODSON, SHANE HENNEN, CURTIS MEEKS and ROBERT STROUD, together with others, supplied other defendants and their co- conspirators in the Scheme with cheating technology.\n36. On numerous occasions, certain defendants and their co-conspirators invited the Victims, who were often wealthy, to Rigged Games. To attract the Victims, in some instances, well-known former professional athletes participated in the Rigged Poker Scheme and were referred to as \"Face Cards.\" The Face Cards were members of the Cheating Teams and received a portion of the criminal proceeds in exchange for their participation in the Scheme. The defendants CHAUNCEY BILLUPS and DAMON JONES, both of whom are former professional basketball players, were Face Cards and members of the Cheating Teams.\n\n7\n\n37.\n\nAt the Rigged Games, the members of the Cheating Teams—including the defendants and their co-conspirators-used card shuffling machines that were purportedly randomly shuffling the playing cards to ensure fairness (the \"Rigged Shuffling Machines\"). However, the Rigged Shuffling Machines were secretly altered to use concealed technology to read the cards in the deck, predict which player at the table had the best poker hand, and relay that information via interstate wires to an off-site operator (the “Operator\"). The Operator then communicated that information by cellular telephone to a member of the Cheating Team seated at the Rigged Game poker tables, referred to as the “Quarterback” or “Driver,\" who used secret signaling to share the information with the other members of the Cheating Teams playing in the Rigged Games. The Cheating Teams used the information from the Quarterback to defraud the Victims, who believed they were playing “straight” illegal poker games. At times, the defendants also utilized other cheating technologies such as electronic poker chip trays that could secretly read cards placed on the poker table; card analyzers that utilized technology loaded onto decoy cellular telephones that could surreptitiously detect which cards were on the table; and playing cards that had markers visible only to individuals wearing specially designed contact lenses or sunglasses.\n38. With respect to poker games held in the New York City area, members and associates of the Bonanno, Gambino and Genovese Crime Families, used threats and intimidation to assure payment of debts from the Rigged Games and the \"square\" illegal poker games organized by the defendants AMMAR AWAWDEH, ZHEN HU, ROBERT STROUD and SETH TRUSTMAN and their co-conspirators, as well as to \"protect” the games from competition and other potential threats. In exchange, members and associates of the Bonanno, Gambino and Genovese Crime Families received portions of the proceeds from the Rigged\n\n8\n\nGames and the \"square\" illegal poker games. The defendants ERNEST AIELLO, THOMAS GELARDO and JULIUS ZILIANI received proceeds on behalf of the Bonanno Crime Family. The defendants JOHN GALLO, LEE FAMA, JOSEPH LANNI and ANGELO RUGGIERO, JR., received proceeds on behalf of the Gambino Crime Family. The defendant MATTHEW DADDINO received proceeds on behalf of the Genovese Crime Family. In addition to receiving proceeds from the Rigged Games and \"square\" illegal poker games, certain members and associates of the Gambino Crime Family participated on Cheating Teams, including the defendants AMMAR AWAWDEH, LOUIS APICELLA, GALLO and NICHOLAS MINUCCI. To conceal the nature and extent of the Rigged Poker Scheme, as well as\n\n39.\n\nthe proceeds from \"square\" illegal poker games, the defendants and their co-conspirators laundered their criminal proceeds through shell companies and third parties. The defendant ANTHONY SHNAYDERMAN and his associates and entities laundered the proceeds from the Rigged Games and the \"square\" illegal poker games for other defendants and their co- conspirators. In exchange for a fee, SHNAYDERMAN received payments from Victims of the Rigged Games and the “square” illegal poker games and provided cash or other forms of payment, such as cryptocurrency, to the defendants, including, among others, the defendants AMMAR AWAWDEH, ROBERT STROUD and SETH TRUSTMAN. The defendants also sent SHNAYDERMAN proceeds from the Rigged Games and \"square\" illegal poker games through wire transfers and other means, which SHNAYDERMAN, for a fee, converted to cash\n\nfor the defendants.\n\n40. For example, in furtherance of the Rigged Poker Scheme, in or around April 2019, several of the defendants participated in Rigged Games in Las Vegas, Nevada, at which they defrauded Victims of at least $50,000. The defendants CHAUNCEY BILLUPS,\n\n9\n\nERIC EARNEST, JAMIE GILET, ROBERT STROUD and SOPHIA WEI organized and\nparticipated in these Rigged Games using a Rigged Shuffling Machine supplied by STROUD. 41. As another example, in or around June and July 2023, several of the\ndefendants participated in Rigged Games at the Lexington Avenue Game, at which they defrauded John Doe #1, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, of approximately $1.8 million. The defendants AMMAR AWAWDEH, JOHN GALLO, MARCO GARZON, KENNY HAN, ZHEN HU, JOHN MAZZOLA and SETH TRUSTMAN organized and participated in the games involving John Doe #1 using a Rigged Shuffling Machine supplied by the defendants TONY GOODSON and ROBERT STROUD. The defendants ERNEST AIELLO, MATTHEW DADDINO, LEE FAMA, JOHN GALLO, THOMAS GELARDO and JULIUS ZILIANI received a portion of the criminal proceeds from the games involving John Doe #1 on behalf of the Bonanno, Gambino and Genovese Crime Families. The defendant ANTHONY SHNAYDERMAN and his co-conspirators laundered at least $100,000 of the criminal proceeds from the games involving John Doe #1.\n42. As another example, in or about June 2023, several of the defendants participated in Rigged Games in East Hampton, New York, at which they defrauded John Doe #2 and John Doe #3, individuals whose identities are known to the Grand Jury, of at least $46,500 and $105,000, respectively. The defendants LOUIS APICELLA, AMMAR AWAWDEH, JOHN GALLO, TONY GOODSON, KENNY HAN, OSMAN HOTI, HORATIO HU, JOHN MAZZOLA, NICHOLAS MINUCCI and ROBERT STROUD organized and participated in the Rigged Games involving John Doe #2 and John Doe #3 using a Rigged Shuffling Machine supplied by GOODSON and STROUD. The defendant ANTHONY\n\n10\n\n10\n\nSHNAYDERMAN and his co-conspirators laundered criminal proceeds from the Rigged Games\n\ninvolving John Doe #2 and John Doe #3.\n\n43. As another example, in or about September 2024, several of the defendants participated in Rigged Games in Miami, Florida, at which they defrauded John Doe #4, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, of at least $60,000. The defendants NELSON ALVAREZ, JAMIE GILET, TONY GOODSON, KENNY HAN, JOHN MAZZOLA, MICHAEL RENZULLI and ROBERT STROUD organized and participated in the Rigged Games involving John Doe #4 using a Rigged Shuffling Machine supplied by\nGOODSON and STROUD. The defendant ANTHONY SHNAYDERMAN laundered criminal proceeds from the Rigged Games involving John Doe #4.\n\n44.\n\nOverall, from approximately April 2019 through the present, the Rigged\n\nPoker Scheme caused losses to the Victims of at least $7,150,000.\n\n45.\n\nOn several occasions, the defendants and their co-conspirators used threats\nof force and violence to secure the repayment of debts from illegal poker games. Among other instances, in or about and between November 2022 and February 2023, the defendants THOMAS GELARDO, ZHEN HU and JULIUS ZILIANI conspired to and did extort John Doe #5, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, to secure the repayment of debt from illegal poker games. Similarly, in or about and between September 2023 and October 2023, the defendants SAUL BECHER, ZHEN HU and SETH TRUSTMAN conspired to and did extort John Doe #6, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, to secure the repayment of debt from illegal poker games.\n46.

suggest\n\nThe Israeli military is exerting control over more of Gaza than expected from the ceasefire deal with Hamas, a BBC Verify analysis has found.\n\nUnder the first stage of the deal, Israel agreed to retreat to a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. The divide was marked by a yellow line on maps released by the military and has become known as the \"Yellow Line\".\n\nBut new videos and satellite images show that markers placed by Israeli troops in two areas to mark the divide have been positioned hundreds of metres deeper inside the strip than the expected withdrawal line.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz - who instructed troops to place the yellow blocks as markers - warned that anyone crossing the line \"will be met with fire\". There have already been at least two deadly incidents near the boundary line.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground.\"\n\nThere has been a consistent  lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed , with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October.\n\nOn 14 October the IDF issued the latest version marking the Yellow Line on their online map, which is used to communicate its position to people in Gaza.\n\nBut in the north, near the al-Atatra neighbourhood, drone footage from the IDF showed that a line of six yellow blocks were up to 520m further inside the Strip than would have been expected from the IDF maps.\n\nFootage geolocated by BBC Verify showed workers using bulldozers and diggers to move the heavy yellow blocks and place them along the coastal al-Rashid road.\n\nA similar situation was visible in southern Gaza, where a satellite image taken on 19 October showed 10 markers erected near the city of Khan Younis. The line of blocks ranges between 180m-290m inside the Yellow Line set out by the IDF.\n\nIf these two sections of boundary were typical of how the markers were being placed along the entirety of the line then Israel would be exerting control over a notably larger area than expected from the ceasefire agreement.\n\nMultiple analysts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the blocks were intended to create a \"buffer zone\" between Palestinians and IDF personnel. One expert said the move would be consistent with a long-term \"strategic culture\" which seeks to insulate Israel from nearby territories it does not fully control.\n\n\"This gives the IDF space to manoeuvre and create a 'kill zone' against potential targets,\" Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London, said.\n\n\"Potential targets can be engaged before they reach the IDF perimeter. It is a bit like no man's land that does not belong to anyone – and Israel tends to take that territory from the opponent's chunk not its own.\"\n\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disparity between the markers and the IDF map was an intentional design to warn civilians they are \"approaching an area of increased risk\".\n\nNoam Ostfeld, an analyst with the risk consultancy Sibylline, said that some blocks \"seem to be positioned near roads or walls, making them easier to spot\".\n\nBut a post to X by the Israeli defense minister seemed to suggest that the yellow blocks marked the actual line, warning that \"any violation or attempt to cross the line will be met with fire\".\n\nThere is already confusion among Gazans over areas where it is safe to go.\n\nAbdel Qader Ayman Bakr, who lives near the temporary boundary in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shejaiya district, told the BBC that, despite promises from Israel of clear markings, he had seen none put in place.\n\n\"Each day, we can see Israeli military vehicles and soldiers at a relatively close distance, yet we have no way of knowing whether we are in what is considered a 'safe zone' or 'an active danger zone',\" he said.\n\n\"We are constantly exposed to danger, especially since we are forced to remain here because this is where our home once stood.\"\n\nSince the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF has reported a number of instances of people crossing the Yellow Line. On all occasions the IDF said it fired upon those involved.\n\nBBC Verify has obtained and geolocated footage showing the aftermath of one incident on 17 October, which the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said killed 11 civilians - including women and children all reportedly from the same family.

second highest-ranking general after military purge\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has named a veteran who has overseen anti-corruption efforts in the military to be the country's second highest ranking general, just days after nine generals were expelled in a major purge.\n\nThe appointment of Zhang Shengmin as second-ranked vice chairman of the Central Military Commission was announced at the end of a four-day Central Committee meeting.\n\nZhang becomes the third highest official in the country's top military body, after the first-ranked vice chairman and President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe

decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the streets  where it happened  – the images of Bloody Sunday are painted on the walls and seared in people's minds.\n\nA civil rights march was held on a wintry, sunny afternoon in Londonderry.\n\nThe demonstration was a protest against the policy of internment – imprisoning people without trial – which had been put in place following three years of violence.\n\nSoldiers from the Parachute Regiment  shot dead 13 people  in the Bogside area – which was, and still is, a strongly Irish nationalist community.\n\nOne image became particularly prominent.\n\nPictures showed a Catholic priest, Fr Edward Daly, waving a blood-stained white handkerchief as he tried to protect a group carrying a teenager, Jackie Duddy, who had been fatally wounded.\n\nNews camera operators captured much footage on the day.\n\nThe BBC archive features Fr Daly telling a reporter that soldiers \"just seemed to fire in all directions\" and he was \"absolutely certain\" that there was no provocation.\n\nThat version of what happened wasn't accepted by the initial investigation.\n\nThe Widgery Tribunal found the Army had been shot at first.\n\nDuring the peace process, Tony Blair's government set up another inquiry, after campaigning by bereaved relatives, who said Widgery had been a whitewash.\n\nIn 2010,  the report by Lord Saville  said that on balance, the paratroopers had fired first and that none of the victims had posed any threat.\n\nThe then  Prime Minister, David Cameron, apologised in the House of Commons  – saying killings were \"unjustified and unjustifiable\".\n\nThe police began to investigate.\n\nOne former paratrooper, known as Soldier F, was prosecuted for murder.\n\nHe was charged over the killings of James Wray, 22, and 26-year-old William McKinney.\n\nSoldier F was also accused of attempting to murder Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon, Michael Quinn, and an unknown person.\n\nThere is a  legal order preserving the veteran's anonymity , which his lawyers have argued is necessary because he is at risk of attack.\n\nHe told the Saville Inquiry that he had only fired at people who were armed.\n\nThat claim was rejected in the final report.\n\nMaterial from the inquiry could not be used directly as evidence in the criminal process.\n\nIn the dock, the veteran was screened from view behind a blue curtain.\n\nHe  spoke for the first time in court at a hearing in December 2024 , to reply \"not guilty\" when the charges were put to him.\n\nRelatives of those who were killed on Bloody Sunday  travelled from Derry to Belfast Crown Court each day of the trial.\n\nJohn Kelly, whose brother Michael was killed, said they always knew that listening to the proceedings would be painful.\n\n\"I can see everything in my mind's eye,\" John said, as we walked around the main locations mentioned in the trial – from Rossville Street, where Michael was shot dead, to the adjoining Glenfada Park, where James Wray and William McKinney were killed.\n\n\"It even takes me back to where I was that day.\n\n\"I helped to carry Michael and place him in the ambulance.\n\n\"I relived every moment during the evidence.\n\n\"But even with having to go through all that – it's still worthwhile for me.\"\n\nBereaved  families had to fight a separate court case to make the trial go ahead .\n\nIn 2022, they  won a legal challenge against a move by crown lawyers to drop the prosecution of Soldier F.\n\nProsecutors had been concerned that key evidence would not be usable in court.\n\nOn  the first day of the trial , the Northern Ireland veterans' commissioner suggested that prosecutions of military personnel indicated an imbalanced approach to investigations into killings from the years known as the Troubles.\n\nOutside the court gates, David Johnstone told the media: \"There are many families of soldiers across Northern Ireland and Great Britain who have never had the truth regarding the loss of their loved one, or the opportunity of justice.\"\n\nHe pointed out that more than 1,000 members of the security forces had been killed during the conflict, adding: \"The vast majority of the 300,000 armed forces who served in Northern Ireland did so with restraint, dignity and professionalism.\"\n\nThe trial was held in front of a judge only, as is standard practice in Northern Ireland for cases from the Troubles.\n\nJoe Mahon ,  Joseph Friel  and  Michael Quinn  were among the witnesses who gave evidence in person.\n\nThe accounts of other civilians were given through statements, which prosecution barristers read to the court.\n\nA number of witnesses told how they tried to escape from intense shooting on Rossville Street by going into Glenfada Park, which is a courtyard.\n\nBut they came under fire there too, with several describing how they were shot when running away, and tried to protect themselves by lying still on the ground and pretending to be dead.\n\nHowever, the only evidence which specifically said that Soldier F fired his rifle in Glenfada Park came in the form of statements from two other paratroopers, known as Soldiers G and H.\n\nThe statements were made in 1972 to the initial investigation by the Royal Military Police, and then to the Widgery Inquiry.\n\nThey said they fired shots along with Soldier F.\n\nSoldier G has died, while Soldier H indicated he would not testify in the trial, and would use his legal protection against self-incrimination.\n\nDefence lawyers argued that the key prosecution evidence was \"fundamentally inconsistent\" and was not backed up by the civilians' accounts.\n\nOn that basis, they applied to have the case dismissed.\n\nThe judge did not grant that application – but the  defence continued to present the issues around the soldiers' statements  as a major reason why the judge should acquit Soldier F.\n\nThe veteran himself did not testify.\n\nHis lawyer read into the record a statement which the accused gave to police – in which Soldier F said he was \"sure\" that he \"discharged his duties\", but he would not be answering questions because he no longer had \"any reliable recollection\" of events.\n\nGlenfada Park is now the site of the Museum of Free Derry.\n\nOn its exterior wall, there is a patch of perspex, which preserves the circular bullet marks from Bloody Sunday.\n\nInside, James Wray's jacket is on display, its shoulder torn by the shots which killed him.\n\nOn a shelf in the same cabinet is a camera which William McKinney was carrying when he was shot dead.\n\nMany historians say the killings inflamed the unrest in Northern Ireland.\n\nAfter 53 years of grief, controversy and campaigning, the criminal process has ended with no conviction."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgk0y18mrvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"23:43:23.303+00:00","title":"I thought my insides were falling

It's not life-threatening, but it can have a profound impact on daily life, relationships and mental health.\n\nFor Helen, the shock came just two weeks after a difficult birth with her second child.\n\n\"I stood up from the sofa and suddenly felt things shift,\" she recalls. \"It felt like when a tampon isn't sitting properly, you can feel something's not right.\"\n\nConfused and frightened, she grabbed a mirror and her phone to see what was happening.\n\n\"I'd never even heard the term prolapse before,\" she says, and since talking openly about it she's realised it's often a \"taboo\" subject despite being very common.\n\nHelen believes the shame and stigma surrounding it has led to a lack of awareness among women and health professionals - something she's now fighting to change.\n\nHelen says her diagnosis, confirmed by a doctor, brought confusion and fear as she was \"hoping for an explanation, fix or some sense of urgency, instead I got a shrug of the shoulders.\"\n\nThe initial advice she was given was to not do anything that could make it worse such as running, jumping or lifting.\n\n\"It kind of felt like the advice was don't live your life,\" she says.\n\nPerhaps more debilitating than the physical symptoms was the isolation Helen felt.\n\n\"You live with it in embarrassment, silence, shame and isolation,\" she explains. \"Because you don't talk about it, you think you're the only person in the world it's happened to.\"\n\nHelen initially ventured onto Instagram to seek support. Finding other people on the social platform who were similarly anxious and confused and in some cases too embarrassed to seek help prompted her to eventually launch a podcast and write a book, Why mums don't jump.\n\nHer goal was to create a platform for women to share stories and break the silence around pelvic health.\n\n\"I was angry because no-one ever talked about it. So I decided I would.\n\n\"I wanted to give women the knowledge that I'd found so hard to come by, and comfort in knowing they were not on their own.\"\n\nDr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says Helen's experience is far from unique and issues can arise as symptoms aren't always obvious.\n\n\"Sometimes physically there isn't a lump to see, there's just a feeling of pressure and it might be in the lower back, at the front or slightly higher up near your belly button,\" she explains. \"The symptoms can also be more pronounced during sex which is again massively taboo.\"\n\nProlapse can happen for a variety of reasons including childbirth, heavy lifting, being overweight or even after a hysterectomy. And in rare cases, it can affect men too.\n\nPelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help to improve symptoms, but sometimes medical treatment is needed such as vaginal pessaries or surgery.\n\nGynaecologist Dr Christine Ekechi says women with prolapse may notice a swelling or a lump within their vagina \"as essentially what has happened is that we have weakening of the ligaments within the pelvic floor that can move for example the bladder\".\n\nHelen says what began as a lonely Google search 15 years ago, has now become something far more powerful, helping women to recognise when there is a problem and seek help.\n\nIn her case, recovery has been slow, but transformative.\n\n\"For me it's been a long process of building up slowly, doing postpartum [immediately after pregnancy] exercises, building up some strength work.\"\n\nEventually she saw a physio who helped her to start running again. Helen says this was \"a massive moment because I really thought that was something I would never do again.\"\n\nNow, Helen is doing more than she ever thought possible and has signed up for a 10k run.\n\n\"I feel good and I've learned how to manage my symptoms. I've still got prolapse, but it doesn't rule my life in the way that it once was.\n\n\"I feel like I'm kind of winning the battle.\"\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

other teenagers online, her mother was not too worried.\n\nBut within weeks, Christina (not her real name) found her daughter's behaviour had spiralled out of control.\n\nHer daughter had fallen victim to the extreme online right-wing Satanist group called 764. These groups consist primarily of teenage boys and young men who want to harm girls.\n\nAt least four British teenagers have been arrested in connection with the activities of the international group, including 764 member Cameron Finnigan from Horsham in West Sussex. He was  jailed for six years  in January.\n\nWarning: This article contains distressing content\n\nChristina says she believes her daughter was targeted by 764 after visiting a chat room where people were discussing self-harm.\n\nThe group persuades victims to carry out sexual acts, harm themselves and even attempt suicide during live video calls while its members watch.\n\nChristina said a member of 764 had gained her daughter's trust before manipulating and coercing her.\n\nShe said: \"I watched my mother get diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and fight for her life and it was not as hard to watch as it was to watch my daughter deteriorate.\n\n\"She deteriorated faster and worse than watching somebody essentially dying of cancer.\"\n\nChristina said removing her daughter from 764's grip had been challenging.\n\n\"I kept going 'just block them, stop talking to them', but I was not seeing the level of influence that was already there, and the level of fear.\n\n\"They absolutely just beat her down to make her feel she is absolutely nothing without them or with them.\"\n\nChristina and her daughter are slowly rebuilding their lives and she says she wants parents to understand the dangers these groups pose.\n\n\"My daughter stopped sleeping.

Putin’s tactical triumph didn’t last long.\n\nA week ago, it looked as if the Russian president had outmaneuvered his adversaries yet again with a deftly placed call to President Trump that scuttled any expansion in American support for Ukraine.\n\nBut on Thursday, Russians awoke to new American sanctions against their oil industry. It is the most direct punitive measure that Mr. Trump has taken against Russia in his second term, after electing not to follow through on a series of earlier threats.\n\nThe sanctions, which take aim at the heart of the Russian economy, dealt one of the biggest blows so far this year to Mr. Putin’s effort to cajole Mr. Trump into forcing Ukraine to capitulate to Russia’s main demands, including the concession of territory Ukraine still holds.\n\nBut analysts who study Mr. Putin said the new sanctions were unlikely to change the Russian president’s war goals. Russian companies have long been preparing for the possibility of increased sanctions, said Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the political analysis firm R.Politik. Mr. Putin remains willing to bear enormous losses to accomplish his aims, she said, and Mr. Trump may well change his mind again.\n\n“They’ll shrug their shoulders and say, ‘OK, he’ll ripen in three months,’” Ms. Stanovaya said of Russia’s reaction to Mr. Trump’s sanctions. “For Putin, this war remains existential, and he is ready to endure a lot.”\n\nOil prices rose sharply on Wednesday in a sign of the sanctions’ potential potency, which may ultimately depend on how the penalties are enforced and how energy buyers react to them.

2025-10-23T10:06:32-04:00\n\nBusiness concerns could end an impasse between United States and India over Russian oil, and whether India ought to feel free to buy it.\n\nPresident Trump has said several times that India was on the verge of ending its purchases, which have saved India billions of dollars while generating billions in revenue for Russia in the years since it invaded Ukraine.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury announced a new raft of sanctions aimed at Russia’s two biggest oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil. The move could convince India’s private businesses and government-owned oil companies that it is time to quit buying oil from Russia, in a way that threats and tariffs did not.\n\nMuyu Xu, a senior crude oil analyst based in Singapore for Kpler, a market research firm, wrote that the sanctions were expected to “trigger a decline in exports” almost immediately, as the Indian companies that buy the targeted Russian firms’ oil consider how they might be affected.\n\n“India would scramble for prompt cargoes to fill the supply gap left by reduced Russian flows,” Ms. Xu wrote.\n\nDuttatreya Das, a former official at one of India’s national oil companies who now works with Ember, a global energy think tank, said that “exposure to Middle Eastern supplies would increase.” Put another way, he said, it was “going back to the old times.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The political landscape is further complicated by memories of past violence, including the 2010 civil war linked to Gbagbo’s refusal to accept defeat, and recent protests that prompted arrests and a security crackdown.

lady, a tycoon and a 'safe pair of hands' vie for power\n\nDancing dominates campaign rallies in Ivory Coast but the pulsing energy and fervour belies concerns about the political landscape in the world's largest cocoa producer.\n\nSaturday's presidential vote in the West African nation is as notable for the candidates who have been banned from running as for those who are vying for the top job.\n\nWhile incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, a hero to some for bringing growth over the last 15 years to a country following a brutal civil war, is facing a backlash from those who see the 83-year-old's fourth-term bid as a slap in the face to democracy - even though his candidacy is allowed by the constitution.\n\nProminent opposition leader Tidjane Thiam was disqualified in April after a court  ruled that he had forfeited his Ivorian citizenship when he became French in 1987 - a ruling that he disputed - while former President Laurent Gbagbo was barred because of a 2018 criminal conviction.\n\nIt was Gbagbo's refusal to accept defeat to Ouattara in a run-off vote in 2010 that sparked a post-election conflict that left more than 3,000 people dead and traumatised a nation vital to the global supply of chocolate.\n\nYet Ouattara, known to his supporters by his initials \"Ado\", still faces strong competition, especially from Gbagbo's former wife, and one of the country's richest man, popular with urban voters - but it is a divided opposition.\n\nThere are four candidates up against the octogenarian:\n\nDespite the economic progress under Ouattara, his opponents hope to capitalise on complaints from many of the country's poor, who are not feeling the benefits of the rapid growth.\n\n\"The economy is growing, but not for us,\" Billon, the business tycoon and youngest of all the candidates - representing the Democratic Congress (Code) - has said.\n\nDancing on stage during rallies in front of thousands of supporters in the political capital, Yamoussoukro, he has taken to doing judo moves to show he is \"ready for the job and full of energy\".\n\n\"Young people can't find jobs, and the cost of living is rising,\" says the politician, who is confident that if he gets into a second-round run-off with the incumbent, then \"Ouattara's time will be over\".\n\nBillon had been hoping to represent the centre-right Democratic Party (PDCI) of late President Henri Konan Bédié.\n\nBut in the end the party went for the now-disqualified Thiam - so without a candidate on the ballot paper, Billon feels sure he will get the backing of PDCI supporters.\n\n‎However, Simone Gbagbo, leader of the leftist Movement of Capable Generations (MGC), has also positioned herself as a voice for the disaffected - and believes those votes will come to her.\n\nAlways smiling and wearing traditional smart dresses, her energy sparks and she holds her mic like a pop star. A natural campaigner, she knows how to revitalise her supporters.\n\nThe former first lady, once dubbed \"the iron lady\" because of her reputation for toughness, is part of the CPA-CI, a coalition of opposition groups that came together earlier this year to protest against Ouattara's candidacy.\n\n\"President Ouattara has done some good things, but he destroyed education,\" she told her supporters recently.\n\nWith a background in education, academia and trade unions, her campaign has focused on rebuilding schools and offering better opportunities to young people.\n\n‎Despite such criticism, Ouattara's backers remain confident. His rallies seem a little bit less dynamic than in 2010, 2015 and 2020 - but they still attract many people of all ages.\n\nThe popular hit Coup du marteau (Hammer Blow) by Ivorian rapper Tam Paiya and featuring Team Paiya has become the unofficial anthem for his RHDP party with former prime ministers, ministers, MPs and other influential backers often seen dancing to it with energy.\n\n\"The president is in good shape and ready to serve again,\" says government spokesman Adama Coulibaly, pointing to major public works and investor confidence as proof of the country's stability.\n\nBut despite the change to the constitution in 2016 that allowed Ouattara to run for a third and fourth term, his candidacy this time round has sparked anger and the government has reacted to recent protests with a swift crackdown.\n\nMore than 700 demonstrators were arrested earlier this month following an opposition march and 50 sentenced to three years in jail.\n\n‎There is some concern that this could be the prelude to further disorder in the aftermath of the vote.\n\nThe memory of past political violence remains vivid - and to avoid any unrest, the security forces have been deployed across major cities.\n\nNevertheless many residents are taking precautions.\n\n\"We're leaving Abidjan a week before the vote,\" Ahoua Diomande, a mother of two, told the BBC.\n\n\"Each election brings fighting and deaths.\"\n\n‎‎But there are optimists too, like Charm Matuba, an Abidjan resident who originally hails from Congo-Brazzaville and has been closing following the campaign even though she cannot vote.\n\n\"I know everything will go well. Ivorians don't want to die again for politicians,\" she said.\n\n\"I just hope people will go to vote. All my friends support Simone. She's a leader, a true source of inspiration. She can create the surprise.\"\n\n‎‎Regional loyalties are likely to play a large role in this election, as they have done in the past.\n\nOuattara enjoys strong support in the north, where his base among Dioula-speaking communities remains loyal - and he opted to launch his campaign in the west where he has previously picked up votes.\n\nSimone Gbagbo also draws much of her backing from the west - and from the south-west too, historic strongholds of her ex-husband's former party.\n\nBillon appeals to urban voters and the central regions, promising to modernise the economy and foster generational change.\n\n\"He represents the young generation,\" said Salifou Sanogo, who is 19. \"It will be my first time voting and seriously, I know he will win. Ouattara is too old, tired and didn't do anything for us. We need change, we need Billon.\"\n\nThe endorsement of the excluded candidates would be significant but neither Thiam nor former President Gbagbo has backed anyone else.\n\nHowever, Simone Gbagbo is supported by Charles Blé Goudé, once a close ally of her former husband and who has opted not to put his hat in the ring.\n\n\"Bring Simone to the palace,\" the charismatic politician told thousands of his Young Patriot COJEP party supporters at one recent rally.\n\nAlong with the economy, foreign relations have also become a campaign issue.\n\nIvory Coast has taken a hard line against the military juntas in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, which now form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) and have sought closer ties with Russia.\n\nThese regimes accuse Ouattara of siding with France, their former colonial power, and pursuing a \"secret agenda\" on its behalf - which his government denies, maintaining it supports democratic governance in the region.\n\nBut the rhetoric has sharpened tensions with its northern neighbours. Some opposition candidates, including Ahoua Don Mello, have suggested that Ivory Coast should be \"open to new partnerships\" with Russia and China, arguing that the country must diversify its alliances.\n\nHis message has resonated in parts of western Ivory Coast, where anti-French sentiment runs deep.\n\nWhen fake news alleging that Ouattara had died trended on social media last march, the Ivorian authorities believe it started from the AES countries.\n\n‎‎As the noise and excitement of campaigns draw to a close, President Ouattara's supporters insist that continuity is the key to preserving stability and economic progress.\n\nHis critics argue that another term could deepen frustration and erode trust in democratic institutions - something that has dangerous echoes of the past.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv1rkxjyyno","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:13:55.239+00:00","title":"What we know about the NBA gambling and rigged poker game arrests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US authorities have arrested several NBA figures, including coach Chauncey Billups and player Terry Rozier, in connection with two major fraud cases: one involving players allegedly faking injuries to manipulate illegal sports betting, and another involving a sophisticated illegal poker ring tied to New York’s five major crime families.

Thursday, including of a star player and a coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA), for alleged illegal sports betting.\n\nAmong those in custody are Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, both of whom were reportedly arrested after their teams' games on Wednesday.\n\nThe arrests are part of a sweeping investigation into illegal gambling that produced two indictments, the FBI said — one into players who are allegedly faking injuries to influence betting odds, and another involving an illegal poker ring tied to organised crime.\n\nHere is what we know about the cases.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel described the allegations to reporters as \"mind-boggling\".\n\nThey include indictments in two major cases, officials said, both involving fraud.\n\nThe first case is called \"operation nothing but bet,\" in which players and associates allegedly used insider information to manipulate wagers on major sports betting platforms.\n\nIn some cases, players altered their performance or took themselves out of games to ensure those bets were paid out, according to New York City police commissioner Jessica Tisch. Those bets amounted to tens of thousands of dollars in profits.\n\nThe second case is more complex in nature, officials said, and involved four of the five major crime families in New York as well as professional athletes.\n\nThe accused in that case are alleged to have participated in a scheme to rig illegal poker games and steal millions of dollars.\n\nThey did so using \"very sophisticated\" technology including off-the-shelf shuffling machines, special contact lenses and eye glasses to read pre-marked cards, according to authorities. They also used an X-ray table that could read cards that were face down.\n\nThe victims were allegedly lured to play in these games with former professional athletes, who acted as \"face cards\" in the scheme. The victims were unaware that everyone, including the dealer and the other players, were in on the scam.\n\nAuthorities said they began probing these poker games in 2019, spanning multiple locations including the Hamptons, Las Vegas, Miami and Manhattan.\n\nThe accused allegedly laundered profits via bank wires and crypto currencies.\n\nThey are also alleged to have committed acts of violence, including a robbery at gunpoint and extortion against victims.\n\nBoth schemes amounted to tens of millions of dollars in theft and robbery across several years and 11 states, authorities said.\n\nAll in all, authorities say 34 defendants were indicted on charges related to the two fraud cases.\n\nSix were charged in the first case of players allegedly faking injuries to influence betting odds, including Miami Heat player Rozier.\n\nNew York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said that in March 2023, Rozier, then playing for the Charlotte Hornets, allegedly let others close to him know that he planned to leave a game early with a supposed injury.\n\nMembers of the group then used that information to place fraudulent bets and cash out big, she said.\n\nCommissioner Tisch said on Thursday after Rozier's arrest that his \"career is already benched, not for injury but for integrity\".\n\nFormer NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested. He is said to have been involved in two games that were allegedly part of the scheme, when the Los Angeles Lakers met the Milwaukee Bucks in February 2023, and a January 2024 game between the Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nAuthorities identified a total of seven NBA games between February 2023 and March 2024 that were part of the case:\n\nThe second case related to illegal poker games involved a total of 31 defendants, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Billups, who was inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame last year.\n\nAuthorities said three of the accused were charged in both cases.\n\nThirteen members and associates of the Bonanon, Genovese and Gambino crime families in New York were also indicted in the illegal poker case.\n\nThe charges include robbery, extortion, wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal gambling.\n\nThe defendants have been arrested and are due to appear in court later on Thursday, authorities said. They are expected to be arraigned in a Brooklyn, New York, court at a later date.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the NBA said it is in the process of reviewing the federal indictments that were announced and that it is co-operating with authorities.\n\nThe league added that Rozier and Billups are being placed \"on immediate leave\" from their teams.\n\n\"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,\" the statement said.\n\nAuthorities said the alleged scheme involved four of the five well-known crime families of New York.\n\nThe Five Families - the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese - have ruled the city's Italian American mafia since 1931.\n\nMajor mob takedowns reduced the prevalence of mafia activity in the 1990s, aided by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and then-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBut, as Thursday's indictments show, the mafia has not entirely gone away.\n\nThe Five Families are part of the larger American-Sicilian mafia operation known as La Cosa Nostra, which translates to \"this thing of ours\", and the members often work closely with their counterparts in Sicily.\n\nOn the Italian side, the gangsters consider New York City to be a \"gym\" where their members go to be toughened up, criminology professor and modern organised crime expert Anna Sergi,  previously told BBC ."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/politics/democrats-shutdown-federal-employee-pay.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"17:39:37.030Z","title":"Democrats Block Federal Worker Pay Bill as Shutdown Drags On","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On the 23rd day of a prolonged government shutdown, Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-backed bill to pay federal employees working without compensation, citing concerns over President Trump’s ability to select which workers receive pay.

2025-10-23T17:39:37.030Z\n\nSenate Democrats on Thursday blocked legislation to pay federal employees who have been working without compensation during the government shutdown, thwarting Republicans’ latest effort to weaken their hand in the federal spending fight.\n\nThe defeat was part of a series of failed partisan votes on the 23rd day of the government shutdown that underscored the depth of the prolonged impasse, with neither Republicans nor Democrats showing any indication that they planned to relent and seek an off ramp.\n\nDemocrats said they opposed the G.O.P. measure because it would hand President Trump wide latitude to pick and choose which workers receive compensation while the government is shuttered. Republicans, who offered the bill in part to bolster their argument that Democrats are to blame for any pain that results from the shutdown, contended they were merely catering to their restive progressive base.\n\nOn a vote of 54 to 45, the measure fell short of the 60 votes it needed to advance. Three Senate Democrats crossed party lines to vote for it: Senators John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, both of Georgia.\n\nSenate Republicans also blocked two alternatives that Democrats attempted to pass by unanimous consent, in which all senators agree to quickly take up and approve a bill. One of them would pay both essential workers and the roughly 700,000 workers who have been furloughed since the shutdown began. A second would pay both categories of workers, and bar Mr. Trump from laying off any additional federal employees.\n\nIn a speech ahead of the test vote on his party’s bill, Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader, rhetorically rolled his eyes at Democrats’ opposition. He accused them of blocking the legislation, sponsored by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, because they were “beholden to the Democratic base.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

suggested on Wednesday that local police could arrest federal agents if they break California law while conducting immigration raids that are expected this week in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWith Border Patrol agents due to arrive, Ms. Pelosi issued the stark warning along with Kevin Mullin, a fellow Democratic representative, who represents the small slice of San Francisco that Ms. Pelosi doesn’t. President Trump has said several times in recent weeks that he wanted to send federal forces to the city.\n\n“While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,” they wrote in a statement on Wednesday. “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.”\n\nA spokeswoman with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe idea appears to have come from Brooke Jenkins, the San Francisco district attorney. Ms. Jenkins said in an interview on Wednesday that she came up with the strategy after seeing federal agents repeatedly roughing up people in Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nIf federal agents came to her city and did the same, District Attorney Jenkins decided, she would treat them like anybody else breaking the law and would seek to prosecute them.\n\nHit people with batons? Beat them up? Not on her watch, she said.\n\n“I had lead time to think about what authority I have and what I can do,” she said. “This is something I felt very strongly about, and I had my office research it.”\n\nDistrict Attorney Jenkins said she had communicated with the San Francisco Police Department about arresting federal agents for “clear, excessive use of force” and that the agency was on board with the concept. A spokesman for the department did not return a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nDistrict Attorney Jenkins said she did not envision police officers handcuffing federal agents in full view on city streets. Instead, she said, local law enforcement could review camera footage of beatings, if they occur, and try to identify the agent involved. Then, she said, she would ask a judge to sign a warrant for the agent’s arrest and seek to prosecute the agent in court.\n\n“For me, this is about San Francisco and what I need to do for San Francisco,” she said.\n\nThat could be much easier said than done. Many federal agents are operating in masks and without badges or other identification; a California law barring agents from wearing masks does not take effect until January and even then is quite likely to face legal challenges. And the Trump administration could seek immunity for its officers or ignore the warrants altogether, Ms. Jenkins acknowledged.\n\nShe said she had not discussed her idea with other prosecutors in California or around the country.\n\nDistrict Attorney Jenkins shared the idea on X earlier this month after Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, said that he would support President Trump sending National Guard troops to San Francisco. (Mr. Benioff later recanted and apologized for his statement on the Guard.)\n\nThe ability of states to arrest federal officers is murky, and without much legal precedent, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. A state cannot unduly interfere with the ability of a federal agent to enforce federal law, he said, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have the legal right to apprehend individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.\n\n“As long as the ICE agents are acting legally, the state can’t prosecute them and hold them liable, even if it dislikes what they’re doing,” Mr. Chemerinsky said.\n\nBut immigration agents who overstep their legal bounds — for instance, by using excessive force — could be sued in California, he said.\n\n“I think the ICE agents can be sued, for battery, for excessive force, in state court, and I think they can be similarly prosecuted,” Mr. Chemerinsky said. “If ICE agents act beyond their legal authority, and violate state law in doing so, they can be prosecuted.”\n\nIn their statement, Representatives Pelosi and Mullin made clear that they believed federal immigration agents had overstepped their authority in other situations.\n\n“Reports of a planned mass immigration raid in the Bay Area are an appalling abuse of law enforcement power,” they wrote. “Broad sweeps that target families and terrorize law-abiding residents betray our nation’s values and waste resources that should focus on real threats to public safety.”\n\nSpokespeople for both Democrats declined to further explain how they believed local or state police should arrest federal agents.\n\nRepresentative Sam Liccardo, a Democrat who previously served as the mayor of San Jose, said he had spoken with colleagues and local law enforcement officials about such an action.\n\n“All law enforcement must comply with the Constitution,” he said, “and to the extent that there’s a violation of federal or state constitutional protections or civil liberties, there’s certainly a basis for asserting a violation.”\n\nIn other cities where the federal government has escalated immigration enforcement, local authorities have complained that federal agents have bent the law and abused civilians.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna, another Bay Area Democrat, has pushed for a requirement that immigration agents wear body cameras and visibly display their names during operations.\n\n“The issue is, a lot of these ICE agents are harassing American citizens,” he said. “They’re acting in a lawless way.”\n\nShawn Hubler contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/technology/trump-pardons-cz-binance.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:16:03-04:00","title":"Trump Pardons Founder of the Crypto Exchange Binance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of Binance, reversing a key enforcement action taken by the Biden administration.

And since Mr. Trump took office, regulators have dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and several other large crypto firms.\n\nBut even in the context of Mr. Trump’s broader dismantlement of crypto enforcement, the pardon for Mr. Zhao is extraordinary.\n\nLong considered the crypto industry’s richest man, Mr. Zhao — a Chinese-born executive who now lives in the United Arab Emirates — admitted that he had violated the law by failing to install rigorous compliance systems at Binance. That allowed people in sanctioned countries and terrorist groups like Hamas, Al Qaeda and the Islamic State to move money on his platform.\n\nWhen he pleaded guilty, Mr. Zhao, who goes by CZ, stepped down as chief executive of Binance, though he remained its majority owner and held onto virtually all of his wealth.\n\nNow he could have an opportunity to retake direct control of the exchange.\n\nFounded in 2017, Binance is by far the largest and most influential crypto exchange in the world — at times, it has processed as much as two-thirds of all digital currency transactions. On its platform, customers can buy, sell and hold popular cryptocurrencies like Binance and Ether, as well as hundreds of more obscure coins.\n\nMr. Zhao is the most powerful executive in the crypto industry. Worth an estimated $90 billion, he commands a vast social media following of worshipful investors who view him as something of a crypto oracle. With a few well-timed posts in 2022, he helped prompt a market panic that resulted in the demise of FTX, one of Binance’s top rivals.\n\nBut even as FTX crumbled, Binance faced mounting pressure from U.S. law enforcement officials.\n\nIn November 2023, Mr. Zhao and Binance both pleaded guilty to violating rules aimed at preventing money laundering. Janet Yellen, who served as treasury secretary at the time, said Binance had allowed “illicit actors to transact freely, supporting activities from child sexual abuse to illegal narcotics to terrorism.”\n\nMr. Zhao received a four-month sentence, a relatively light punishment compared with the penalties doled out to some of his colleagues in the crypto world. Even before he reported to prison, he was laying the groundwork for his next act, networking with tech executives in the United States and weighing investments in artificial intelligence.\n\nMr. Zhao was released in September of last year. Since then, he has become a fixture on the crypto podcast circuit, making flattering comments about Mr. Trump. In one interview, he said that he had read books by Marc Rich and Michael Milken, two business tycoons who went to prison and later received pardons.\n\nTo spearhead his clemency push, Mr. Zhao hired Teresa Goody Guillén, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who also represents Zach Witkoff, the son of Mr. Trump’s Middle East adviser. Working alongside Ms. Goody Guillén was Ches McDowell, a lawyer and lobbyist who is a longtime hunting companion of Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAt the same time, Binance forged a partnership with World Liberty Financial, the crypto company founded by the Trump and Witkoff families. In May, Zach Witkoff announced that Binance would receive a $2 billion investment in the form of a cryptocurrency called USD1 that World Liberty had developed.\n\nAt a recent conference in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Zhao mingled with Zach Witkoff and other founders of World Liberty, posing for photographs. On social media, Mr. Witkoff hailed Mr. Zhao as a “wise man.”\n\nOther figures in Mr. Trump’s orbit were more skeptical. Laura Loomer, the conservative influencer who holds significant sway with Mr. Trump, wrote on X in October that Mr. Zhao should not be pardoned because he had become a citizen of the U.A.E.\n\n“You know who gets Emirati citizenship when they weren’t born in the U.A.E.?” Ms. Loomer wrote. “People who are trying to evade punishment for crimes.”\n\nMr. Zhao shot back. “Many top U.S. entrepreneurs get U.A.E. citizenships,” he wrote. “I implore you to visit some time.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/world/americas/trinidad-bodies-us-strike-venezuela.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:41:11-04:00","title":"A Mystery in Trinidad as Bodies Wash Ashore After U.S. Strikes","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean on September 2, 2025, bodies with burn marks and missing limbs were found washed ashore in Trinidad's northeastern coast, sparking a national mystery.

first body washed ashore on Trinidad’s northeastern coast soon after the United States carried out its first strike in September on a boat in the Caribbean. Villagers said the corpse had burn marks on its face and was missing limbs, as if it had been mangled by an explosion.\n\nThe tides deposited another corpse on a nearby beach days later, drawing a wake of vultures. Its face was similarly unrecognizable, and its right leg appeared to have been blown off.\n\nThe bodies have fueled a mystery that is gripping parts of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation that is within sight of Venezuela’s coast: Who were they? Did a U.S. strike kill them? Will more bodies appear on Trinidad’s beaches?\n\nThe intrigue lays bare how the fallout from the U.S. military campaign targeting Venezuela has reached Trinidad. In contrast to other Caribbean leaders, Trinidad’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, is explicitly supporting the strikes on boats that U.S. officials say are carrying drugs.\n\nBut as the attacks draw claims in Latin America that the United States is violating international law by killing dozens of people who don’t pose an immediate military threat, some in Trinidad are questioning whether Ms. Persad-Bissessar’s hesitance to cross the Trump administration is keeping them from getting answers about the corpses being stored by their government.\n\n“There’s no question in my mind that these men are casualties of war,” said Lincoln Baker, 63, an employee of Trinidad’s water and sewage company in Cumana.\n\nLike many others in Cumana, a sleepy outpost with an Anglican school, food stores and Christian and Muslim houses of worship, Mr. Baker said he was convinced that the two corpses came from the first attack, on Sept. 2, that left 11 people dead.\n\nPort of Spain\n\nThe New York Times\n\nSince then, the mystery bodies have emerged as part of the puzzle involving the U.S. military deployment in the region. The Trump administration publicly says the mission is to combat drug trafficking out of Venezuela, which is a relatively minor player in the global drug trade compared to Colombia, Mexico, Bolivia or Peru.\n\nBut American officials have privately made clear that the objective is to drive President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela from power. The campaign has led to the largest U.S. deployment in Latin America in decades, and it has expanded from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean, with the official death toll from the strikes standing at 37.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago, with about 1.5 million people, has faced various ramifications from the U.S. campaign, including attacks that may have killed its own citizens and heightened tensions with Venezuela.\n\nSeparately from the unidentified corpses, the authorities are investigating reports that two Trinidadians were among those killed in a U.S. strike this month. Relatives of the men, identified as Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, have disputed claims that they were involved in drug trafficking.\n\nCondemnation of the attacks is spreading, based on the assessment of legal specialists and independent United Nations experts that it is illegal for militaries to target in international waters civilians who do not pose an imminent threat.\n\nColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, used this argument over the weekend to accuse the United States of murdering a Colombian fisherman in an attack on a boat that the American authorities claimed had been carrying drugs. President Trump responded by halting aid to Colombia and saying that Mr. Petro, a leftist, had a “fresh mouth toward America.”\n\nMs. Persad-Bissessar has adopted a starkly different strategy. Aligning with Mr. Trump, she is framing her position as a way to shield her country from drug violence.\n\n“I much prefer seeing drug and gun traffickers blown to pieces than seeing hundreds of our citizens murdered each year because of drug-fueled gang violence,” Ms. Persad-Bissessar told reporters when the U.S. campaign began.\n\nRegarding the mystery in Cumana, she said that Trinidad would not use state resources to search for the bodies of those killed because of U.S. military action and that the country’s duty ended with recovering any corpses that wash ashore.\n\nMs. Persad-Bissessar’s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome analysts in Trinidad say she has legitimate reasons to support the U.S. campaign. Trinidad needs U.S. support to bolster its natural gas production, putting its economy on stronger footing.\n\nAnd while much of the world’s cocaine is produced in Colombia, it is sometimes smuggled through Venezuela into Trinidad, which serves as a hub where bulk shipments are received, stored, repackaged and prepared for movement to Europe, West Africa and the United States.\n\n“Trinidad serves as a staging ground within a larger, well-structured trafficking chain,” said Garvin Heerah, a Trinidadian security expert.\n\nStill, by supporting the U.S. deployment, Ms. Persad-Bissessar has set Trinidad apart from other countries in CARICOM, an organization of more than 20 Caribbean countries.\n\nIn mid-October, all CARICOM members except for Trinidad reaffirmed the group’s position that the Caribbean should remain a “zone of peace” where disputes are resolved without foreign military intervention.\n\nAs a result, Venezuela has grown increasingly antagonistic toward Trinidad. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, vowed to respond with “legitimate defense” if an attack on Venezuela is conducted from Trinidad’s territory. (Before the U.S. strikes on boats in the Caribbean, Ms. Persad-Bissessar said she would give American forces access to Trinidadian territory to defend neighboring Guyana, which has been threatened by Venezuela.)\n\nAfter the reports of two potential Trinidadian victims in the U.S. attacks, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez of Venezuela said the strikes supported by Trinidad’s leader had “also extrajudicially murdered humble citizens of her country.”\n\nAmid the feuding, Trinidadians are grasping for answers.\n\nAfter the bodies showed up in Cumana, the Trinidadian police commissioner, Allister Guevarro, noted they had “washed up with apparent injuries.” He said his force would try to investigate where the bodies had come from but that it could be complicated by the corpses’ state of decomposition.\n\nBut at the public forensics center in the capital, Port of Spain, confusion reigned. Some employees said that no autopsies on the two corpses had been done, since bodies must be identified before autopsies can be conducted. No one in a senior position could be reached to confirm this information.\n\nSo far, no one has claimed the bodies and no foreign government has requested that they be repatriated. The bodies were being held at funeral homes in the Port of Spain area.\n\nBishnu Ragoonath, a political analyst in Trinidad, said the government seemed eager to put the issue on the back burner because of the stance Ms. Persad-Bissessar’s government has taken on the U.S. strikes.\n\n“To say that they would openly be concerned by those killed in the process would be counterintuitive,” Mr. Ragoonath said.\n\nOthers in the country, and especially those in Cumana, are arriving at their own conclusions. Various residents said that corpses have been known to appear on beaches in the area, but usually as a result of drownings or boat accidents. Occasionally, a body shows up with gunshot wounds, they said.\n\nSeveral residents said this was the first time in memory that mangled bodies had drifted ashore. What is more, the corpses appeared to belong to men with ethnic backgrounds that are different from most Trinidadians, who descend largely from enslaved Africans and indentured servants from India.\n\n“They seemed to be Latinos — my guess is from Venezuela,” said Branil Lakhan, 23, who lives in a wooden shack near the beach where the first corpse was found. “This is a quiet place where things like this don’t happen.”\n\nNearby, at a drinking establishment called Big Yard, speakers blared Trinibad, the country’s spin on dance hall music. Richard Lewis, 31, an employee at the bar, said he had no doubt that the bodies belonged to Venezuelans caught in the middle of “a war for Venezuela’s oil and gas.”\n\n“Kamla tells us nothing,” he said of the prime minister. “We live in a world where you can’t trust your own shadow.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/san-francisco-bay-area-protesters.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:35:41-04:00","title":"Bay Area Protesters Try to Block Base Entrance Before Immigration Operation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 200 protesters in Alameda, California, blocked the entrance to Coast Guard Island in an effort to prevent federal immigration raids that were expected to begin in the San Francisco Bay Area.

block the entrance to Coast Guard Island in Alameda, Calif., on Thursday morning.\n\nFederal officials said on Wednesday that the base was being used as an operations center for federal immigration raids that were expected to start Friday in the San Francisco Bay Area. But Mayor Daniel Lurie of San Francisco said in a statement on Thursday morning that he received assurances from President Trump and Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, that federal agents would not be deployed to his city.\n\nIt was unclear whether federal agents still intended to conduct operations elsewhere in the Bay Area.\n\nAround 7:30 a.m. Thursday, federal authorities used crowd-control munitions that caused two loud bangs outside the Alameda base, sending the crowd there scattering momentarily from the roadway where Border Patrol vehicles were trying to enter. At least one man appeared to be injured by what protesters described as a pepper bomb.\n\nProtesters marched in the road intersection and held signs that said “No ICE or Troops in the Bay” and “No Hate No Fear, Immigrants are Welcome Here.” A line of U.S. Coast Guard police officers stood facing the demonstrators outside the entrance to the base, which is on an island linked to the mainland by a bridge.\n\nNeither the Department of Homeland Security nor the Coast Guard could be immediately reached for comment.\n\nAs the Alameda protest grew on Thursday morning, the playful spirit that has animated recent anti-ICE protests in Portland, Ore., was also on display. While protesters circled the intersection singing peace songs, a woman in a clown outfit made balloon animals, a folk singer strummed a guitar and an artist set up an easel to paint the gathering.\n\nProtesters said that they wanted the Trump administration to know that the region did not want the planned federal operation.\n\n“Many of us believe our faith is calling us to be here,” said Gala King, an organizer with the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, a religious coalition that helped to organize the demonstration. “They’re trying to wreak havoc and fear and economic hardship in the Bay Area, and we’re not going to let them do that.”\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving in the Bay Area on Wednesday for the immigration enforcement operation, which was expected to begin Friday, federal officials said. There has been no indication so far that National Guard troops will be involved.\n\nPresident Trump has said several times that he wanted to send federal forces to San Francisco.\n\n“San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world,” he said most recently in an interview that aired on Sunday on Fox News. “And then 15 years ago it went wrong, it went woke.”\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Wednesday that he believed Mr. Trump was sending Customs and Border Protection agents primarily to draw protests and create chaos, manufacturing a pretext for a military deployment. He suggested that Mr. Trump would follow by deploying the National Guard and then claiming credit for making the region safer.\n\n“It’s absolutely predictable,” Mr. Newsom said Wednesday at an economic event in Stockton, about 80 miles east of San Francisco. “It’s a script that’s been written for centuries, the authoritarian playbook.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/style/oz-pearlman-mentalist-magician.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:01:51-04:00","title":"The Manosphere’s Favorite Magician","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oz Pearlman, known professionally as 'Oz the Mentalist,' is a celebrated mentalist and magician who performs mind-reading feats at elite private events and high-profile media appearances.

He nudged me to turn it over.\n\nOn the back, Mr. Pearlman had scribbled the letters of the alphabet in jumbled order. He retook the card, sparked a lighter and hovered the card over the flame. Nearly all the letters vanished from the paper. Those that remained formed a word, someone’s name. The name, as promised, was that of my seventh-grade girlfriend. Mr. Pearlman beamed.\n\nIt was a chilly October night, and Mr. Pearlman was sitting for an interview just offstage after executing similarly confounding feats for more than a thousand people aboard the U.S.S. Intrepid, a decommissioned aircraft carrier docked on the West Side of Manhattan.\n\nMr. Pearlman, a.k.a. “Oz the Mentalist,” is a professional disorienter. He’s a practitioner of mentalism, a subset of magic grounded in a performer’s ability to create the illusion of mind-reading and, on occasion, mind control. Often, he appears to know things no stranger should know.\n\nThat evening, Mr. Pearlman, 43, had been the dinner entertainment at a lavish gathering hosted by Zeta Global, a tech company. He had landed the gig after impressing Zeta’s C.E.O., David A. Steinberg, over lunch last summer. Serena Williams glided through the venue; Tom Brady had made an appearance at Zeta’s event earlier in the day. Mr. Pearlman had the unenviable task of following an earsplitting set by the electro-pop duo the Chainsmokers. Clad in a Paul Smith suit, he cast his line out to the sea of attendees, asking a version of a standard cocktail party question:\n\nIf you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be?\n\nMr. Pearlman successfully guessed one man’s choice (Winston Churchill), then a woman’s (Prince), then, after some light ribbing, another man’s (Jennifer Aniston). With each new trick, he dialed up his ambition. Members of the crowd toggled between approving hoots and quizzical murmurs. More than a few looked at tablemates in bewilderment.\n\nAcross his half-hour, Mr. Pearlman also promoted his book, “Read Your Mind: Proven Habits for Success From the World’s Greatest Mentalist,” out Oct. 28. Rather than a mentalism guide, he has produced a part self-help, part business book that his publisher, Viking, is eager — perhaps a little too eager — to compare to Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People.”\n\nThe book is full of strategies for situations like networking or remembering names, and it contains more than a few entrepreneurial clichés. (“Charm is like a Swiss Army knife, useful in so many different situations.”)\n\nThough not a memoir, Mr. Pearlman’s treatise dips in and out of autobiographical life lessons, and seems primed to resonate with a certain segment of potential book buyers: those who subscribe to the sort of audacity and mental toughness preached ad nauseam throughout the manosphere.\n\nIn a world where “mind hacking” and mentally “locking in” hold currency, Mr. Pearlman’s book fits right in. The message — like so many hours of podcasts used to sell so many different kinds of supplements — hinges on the idea that greatness awaits, that you, yes you, can go out and get it.\n\nMr. Pearlman scoffs at excuses and instructs his readers to take action in their lives. Sometimes, his textual tone can come across as a bit scheming. “It’s important to make people feel like they have agency, that they have choice within the set of parameters you give them,” Mr. Pearlman writes. He promises to teach you how to enter “magic mode” to deal with rejection, and, even better, “how to let the haters fuel you.” A “locked door,” he writes, should be reimagined as a “jammed door.” He implores his readers to “replace the word ‘no’ with ‘not yet.’”\n\nHe does not reveal any of his most coveted magical secrets. After all, he has a living to make.\n\nMany people may think of magic only in terms of cruise ships, Las Vegas theaters and children’s birthday parties. As an entertainment category, however, magic has been undergoing a renaissance. Mentalism, in particular, is booming in the private-event space. The morning after his Intrepid show, Mr. Pearlman woke up at 5:30 a.m. to fly to Salt Lake City for a performance at an “ultra-high-net-worth” individual’s birthday party.\n\nMentalism like Mr. Pearlman’s relies on minimal props, and the lack of stage production can lend a performance credibility. Unlike an illusionist who “saws” an assistant in half, Mr. Pearlman may utilize only a few visible tools: a pen, some paper, maybe a white board. The phenomenon, we’re led to believe, is happening not onstage, but in the ether between mentalist and audience.\n\nMr. Pearlman has a wiry demeanor and eyes that pop like Gene Wilder’s when he’s excited, which is often. He’s found success by entertaining rich, influential and especially alpha crowds. “He nails it every time and is comfortable working with celebs in high stress situations,” Mark Cuban offered in an email. “None of us know how it works. Yet it always does.”\n\nUri Geller, whose claims of being able to bend spoons with his mind made him world famous, as well as infamous, floated a simple theory when reached by phone: “Look, you know, maybe Oz has supernatural powers, who knows?”\n\nOn the low end, Mr. Pearlman charges around $150,000 per live show, and often visits multiple cities per week. His 2025 calendar has approximately 150 paid bookings on it, and dozens of TV hits and podcast interviews.\n\nHe’s a grinder. “Read Your Mind,” much of which Mr. Pearlman dictated while running, paints a portrait of an elder millennial with an intense hustler mentality. On Instagram, he frequently posts photos with famous individuals to commemorate their birthdays. In the book, he devotes nearly two pages to a story about trying to get an invite to the billionaire businessman Michael Rubin’s White Party. So far, that dream remains elusive.\n\nMr. Pearlman sleeps odd hours, often on planes, but as an ultrarunner, he has a wellspring of energy. He once ran from Montauk to Manhattan, and, in 2022, set a record for completing 19 loops around Central Park in one day. (It has since been broken.)\n\nHis stamina is “unbelievable” says his friend Adam Schefter of ESPN. After booking Mr. Pearlman to perform at his son’s bar mitzvah, Mr. Schefter hired him for his own 50th birthday party, and eventually served as the conduit between Mr. Pearlman and various N.F.L. franchises. Clips of Mr. Pearlman stupefying quarterbacks such as Aaron Rodgers and Josh Allen tend to ricochet around the web.\n\nThese jock-adjacent stunts have also made him a sought-after guest in the ever-expanding manosphere. Earlier this year, on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” Mr. Pearlman successfully guessed the host’s A.T.M. code. At the time, Mr. Rogan seemed more troubled than enchanted.\n\nIf, as Mr. Geller suggested, Mr. Pearlman does have a superpower, it’s most likely more earthbound: He knows what riles up his audience — specifically his male fans.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nOver an egg sandwich at a coffee shop near his home in Brooklyn, Mr. Pearlman was forthright: He is but a human. He has deemed mentalism “a finite series of tricks.” Like the Taco Bell menu, he just keeps remixing the same small handful of ingredients to delicious effect.\n\nMr. Pearlman was born in Israel and moved to the United States at the age of 3. He has twin older sisters, and spent his childhood imagining that he, too, had a twin. In his telling, this was due to an inexplicable feeling — “like an extension of my being” was how he put it. Eventually, he learned that he had been born alongside a twin brother who died during childbirth. “My mom didn’t tell me until I was 12, and I was actually quite, quite angry about it when she did,” he said. “Because I’m like, ‘How could you have held this back from me for so long?’”\n\nWhen he was 13, his parents divorced, and, to cope, he said he threw himself into magic. Mr. Pearlman was living in Michigan at the time, and Mr. Pearlman’s mother would drive him to Wunderground Magic Shop, some 20 minutes north of downtown Detroit. As a teenager, he would perform strolling tableside magic at a strip mall Italian restaurant for $50 a night.\n\nHe was a gifted student, but also a rebellious teen who shoplifted items from 7-Eleven. In college, he and two friends were arrested after stealing branded shirts and a phone from a Papa John’s pizza shop. Mr. Pearlman claims he spent a weekend in jail dazzling his fellow inmates with card tricks. (His offense was expunged.) In his early 20s, he worked at Merrill Lynch while moonlighting as a magician. Two decades ago, he took the leap to performing magic full time, and, in 2015, landed on “America’s Got Talent,” where he committed fully to mentalism.\n\nIn “Read Your Mind,” Mr. Pearlman puts forth a manosphere-ready maxim: “In real life, you have to stack the cards in your favor. ”\n\nI asked him to elaborate on this concept, a sort of “good” cheating.\n\n“What does a magician do?” he asked. “You shuffle the cards, you give them back to me, and I know where the aces are. Is that cheating? Absolutely that’s cheating. Am I doing it at a card table where it’s illegal? No.”\n\nMr. Pearlman argued that he relied on embellishment and “partial truths” to make his mentalism engaging — and to contour a participant’s memory of a miraculous event.\n\n“In essence, all we’re doing is cheating,” he said of himself and his peers. “We’re using subterfuge, secret methods, ways to deceive you, right? But we’re doing it in an ethical way.”\n\nMr. Pearlman knows how to talk, how to frame things. He’s an adept code-switcher who can charm “Today” show hosts and bro-out behind a podcast mic with ease. He considers himself an alpha, and has had memorable appearances on dude-centric shows such as “Flagrant,” “Pardon My Take” and “Bussin’ With the Boys,” to name a few. When I asked how he felt about his mentalism career being aligned with the coarse, bawdy manosphere, Mr. Pearlman seemed puzzled.\n\n“I don’t know, I hope that it’s not seen that way,” he said. He was quick to note that he had not taken any “heat” from others by becoming popular with this crowd. He also insisted that he would never go on any show that was spewing “outward hate”; that he had a personal barometer of “what’s funny.”\n\nHe briefly waffled in a way that seemed incompatible with his always-in-control persona. “If you told me I could go back in time and not be on those podcasts, that’s nuts,” Mr. Pearlman said. “I would definitely be on them. I could not care less if there’s an association with them as being a negative, because I think those platforms are massive for a reason, right?”\n\nMr. Pearlman’s June appearance on “Joe Rogan” was almost as pivotal for his career as “America’s Got Talent” had been. He had spent six years vying for Mr. Rogan’s attention.\n\nAfter his episode aired, Mr. Pearlman had many new fans. Haters, too. More than a few were unsettled by the A.T.M. code trick. Some commenters called him a Mossad agent, something Mr. Pearlman found “weirdly hilarious” and “so ridiculous.”\n\nIt’s easy to fall down rabbit holes of internet users debating how Mr. Pearlman ascertains his information. Some have argued that in order to know Mr. Rogan’s code, Mr. Pearlman must have hired a private investigator. Mr. Pearlman said “no comment” when I brought up the allegation.\n\n“Obviously, it would be very poor, not very gentlemanly of me, to expose exactly what Oz is doing,” Colin Cloud, a mentalist who headlines at Harrah’s in Las Vegas, told me. “Do I think the best and most fooling method is to hire a private investigator and get the number? Personally, no, because I think it’s the first thing people would think.”\n\nDavid Goggins, a former Navy SEAL, endurance athlete and motivational speaker, has been a friend of Mr. Pearlman’s for about 15 years. Without explicitly revealing any of his friend’s secrets, Mr. Goggins shed light on what he believed to be some of Mr. Pearlman’s process.\n\n“He’s able to really make his audience, the person he’s trying to impress, whichever it may be — he knows a lot of their background,” Mr. Goggins said. “He does a deep dive on who they are. And that really messes them up,” he said, using an expletive.\n\nOn the day we met for breakfast, I asked Mr. Pearlman how much research he had conducted on me before we sat down.\n\n“I would say not a deep dive but, like, a mile-high view,” he said, tossing out my college’s mascot as one illustrative example. Before the interview was over, he had successfully “guessed” a close friend’s nickname.\n\nThat morning, Mr. Pearlman — navy chinos, white sneakers, occasionally glancing at his phone — was also playing the role of Brooklyn dad. He was all smiles, juggling his daughter’s scooter and birthday cupcakes to drop off at her classroom. Mr. Pearlman and his wife-slash-manager, Elisa Rosen, are raising five children, the youngest of whom is five months old.\n\nMs. Rosen told me that her husband’s dream was to become a household name — someone like David Blaine or David Copperfield.\n\n“Read Your Mind” might usher in a new era of his career, but Mr. Pearlman conceded that he was feeling both excitement and trepidation about its publication. Releasing a book into the world means surrendering control, and a magician thrives on the appearance of total control. Luckily, his own book has advice on dealing with confidence-rattling challenges.\n\nHe’s diversifying, but he’s also pragmatic, and is in the early stages of brainstorming a possible third act. His wife, his buddies and even Mr. Pearlman himself all told me that he was keenly aware that his mentalism career could disappear at any moment — that audiences might tire of him, or that artificial intelligence could make his feats seem lame.\n\n“I think that technology is going to catch up to being able to read minds,” Mr. Pearlman said. He mused about how long mentalism might have before machines take over, maybe a decade, maybe less.\n\n“There’d be nothing amazing anymore about me guessing what you’re thinking. Why would that be amazing?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/politics/trump-sanctions-russian-oil.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:52:13-04:00","title":"Trump’s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector Ratchet Up Economic War","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump escalated U.S. economic pressure on Russia by imposing new sanctions on its two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, marking a significant shift from the Biden administration’s restraint on energy sector sanctions.

Putin after months of failed talks to end the war in Ukraine. Although the sanctions hit just two companies, they have the potential — if strictly enforced — to strike a major blow to the Russian economy by sapping it of energy revenues.\n\nThe move represents a striking shift in strategy from Mr. Trump, who has largely refrained from punishing Russia and has questioned the effectiveness of sanctions.\n\nAfter the Biden administration imposed sanctions on about 5,000 Russian targets from 2022 to 2024, Mr. Trump until this week had imposed none.\n\nThose that were in place when Mr. Trump took office have been loosely enforced by the United States this year, essentially giving Mr. Putin a reprieve. Mr. Trump has instead shifted to using tariffs and “secondary tariffs” as leverage against Russia. However, the use of such of trade measures to get countries such as India to stop buying Russian oil has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nWith violence in Ukraine continuing and a planned summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin in Budapest suddenly called off, Mr. Trump turned to sanctions to step up the pressure.\n\n“I just felt it was the right time,” Mr. Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nTo many observers, it appeared that there was little left for the United States to sanction in Russia. The Biden administration rolled out Russia 140 different sanctions packages from 2022 to 2024. Its targets included Russia’s central bank and its financial sector. It also coordinated with allies to cap the price of Russian oil and blacklisted oligarchs.\n\nBut the United States and its allies have treaded carefully around energy.\n\n“Remember the multiple significant rounds of G7 sanctions issued after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 largely spared Russia’s energy sector because of the dependence on Russian oil by Russia’s neighbors in Europe and Asia,” said John E. Smith, a former director of Treasury’s sanctions agency from 2015 to 2018 who is now a partner at Morrison Foerster. “Now the gloves are off.”\n\nAs inflation gripped the global economy in 2022 and 2023, the United States was concerned that a move to take Russian oil off the markets by blacklisting Lukoil and Rosneft would create more problems than it would solve, including by raising gas prices at home. Instead, the Biden administration tried to keep Russian oil flowing at reduced prices by threatening sanctions on tankers, banks and insurers that allowed Russian oil to be sold above a cap of $60 per barrel.\n\nThat approach had limited success as Russia managed to evade those restrictions with a “shadow fleet” of unmarked tankers.\n\nBen Harris, who served as assistant secretary for economic policy in the Biden administration’s Treasury Department and helped craft its sanctions strategy, said that the macroeconomic situation is much different now given that inflation has eased. That has made it possible to directly target Russia’s energy sector.\n\n“Our strategy had been all along to preserve the flow of oil but try to control the price,” said Mr. Harris, who described the Trump administration’s sanctions as “really significant.”\n\nOil prices were down 18 percent this year to about $59 a barrel but jumped higher on Wednesday after the new sanctions were announced.\n\nRussia earns about $600 million per day from oil sales, which it uses to keep its shaky economy afloat and fund its military. Analysts estimate Lukoil and Rosneft account for about half of Russia’s crude oil production and that blacklisting them could cut deeply into their sales. Russia’s central bank might have to intervene to prop up the ruble, and the Russian government’s already depleted budget is likely be further stretched.\n\n“This is going to directly affect the hard currency generation for the war machine,” said Marshall Billingslea, a Hudson Institute fellow who served as served as Treasury’s assistant secretary for terrorist financing during the first Trump administration. “The situation was already bad and it’s going to get markedly worse for the Russian economy.”\n\nForecasts from the International Monetary Fund earlier this month projected that Russia’s economic output will slow to 0.6 percent this year from 4.3 percent in 2024.\n\nUnless there are exemptions put in place, assets of Lukoil and Rosneft in the United States will have to be divested. Since the Trump administration threatened to impose the sanctions with “secondary sanctions,” banks around the world that finance transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft could be subject to penalties and cut off from much of the global financial system.\n\nThe Trump administration has tended to act unilaterally when it comes to economic diplomacy, but in this case the sanctions appeared coordinated with allies. Britain announced sanctions on the same companies last week and the new European Union sanctions package also targeted Russian energy.\n\nThere are other tools at the Trump administration’s disposal. It could blacklist additional Russian banks and impose a blanket ban on Russian energy exports. The United States and Europe have also been discussing seizing Russia’s $300 billion of frozen central bank assets and using those funds for Ukraine’s reconstruction.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump used sanctions aggressively against Iran during his first term, he has been a longtime skeptic of their merits. The president expressed a preference for using tariffs to force other nations to change their behavior and expressed concerns about the erosion of the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency.\n\nSpeaking at the Economic Club of New York last year, Mr. Trump said that excessive use of sanctions “kills your dollar” because countries shift to using other currencies to evade them. Russia has turned to cryptocurrencies to avoid U.S. sanctions and has encouraged the idea of a BRICS currency that would let countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa to reduce their reliance on the dollar.\n\n“I want to use sanctions as little as possible,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he likes to impose them and then remove them as quickly as possible.\n\nEdward Fishman, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, argues that sanctions are more powerful than tariffs because the dollar is used for about 90 percent of global foreign exchange transactions. Tariffs are easier to avoid and impose higher costs on American consumers.\n\nThe success of the sanctions, Mr. Fishman said, will depend on Mr. Trump’s commitment to punishing Chinese banks and Indian oil refiners that allow purchases from Lukoil and Rosneft to go forward.\n\n“It really comes down to secondary sanctions,” said Mr. Fishman, author of “Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.” “I worry that some entities within these countries are going to say, ‘I don’t really believe Trump is going to sanction me.’”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/world/americas/cuba-chinese-man-mexico-drugs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:53:05-04:00","title":"'Brother Wang,' Accused of Being Drug Cartel Fixer, Is Arrested in Cuba","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese national known by the alias 'Brother Wang,' is accused of being a major international drug trafficker who linked Chinese drug manufacturing with Mexico’s powerful cartels and facilitated the smuggling of cocaine and fentanyl across the U.S. by land and air.

smuggled cocaine and fentanyl across the U.S. border by land and air.\n\nHe ran stash houses packed with drugs throughout the United States, according to court documents, and laundered millions in cash using dozens of bank accounts.\n\nAnd he slipped from house arrest — through a hole in the wall, one senior Mexican official said — while under the watch of Mexico’s National Guard, setting off an international manhunt that ended with the announcement this week that he had been arrested in Cuba.\n\nThe U.S. and Mexican authorities have accused the man, a Chinese national named Zhi Dong Zhang, of being a major cartel broker with aliases including “Brother Wang,” and a leader of a criminal network linking China, the Americas and Europe. His detention in Cuba was announced late Wednesday by Mexico’s Security Ministry, which said that he had been detained along with two others, a Mexican and a Chinese national.\n\nThe ministry’s statement did not name Mr. Zhang but clearly described his case — from his arrest in October 2024, when Mexican police and military forces swept into one of Mexico City’s busiest neighborhoods, to his escape from house arrest this summer.\n\nHis escape, recalling embarrassing prison breaks of notorious criminals, raised host of difficult questions for Mexican officials about security lapses and potential corruption. It also came at a particularly sensitive moment in U.S.-Mexican relations, with the Trump administration putting intense pressure on Mexico to do more against drug cartels.\n\nMexico has responded by delivering dozens of suspects to the United States, cracking down on a powerful cartel and tightening cooperation with U.S. officials on crime.\n\nAfter his arrest last year, Mr. Zhang seemed bound for extradition to the United States, where he faces drug trafficking charges, with Mexican officials saying the extradition process was close to being finalized when he slipped out of house arrest. .\n\nMr. Zhang was initially held in a maximum-security prison. But a judge then placed him under house arrest — a decision that President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico called “outrageous,” after his escape.\n\n“How is it possible that even as the attorney general’s office appealed to the Judicial Council, stressing the importance of keeping this person in custody, the judge went ahead and granted his release?” Ms. Sheinbaum said in a news conference.\n\nMr. Zhang executed the escape itself by digging a hole through the wall of the house where he was being held, slipping into an adjoining residence, according to the senior Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive criminal case.\n\nMr. Zhang fled first to Cuba, the official said, explaining that he is then thought to have tried to enter Russia with fake documents, but was detained and sent back to Cuba.\n\nThe security ministry said that it learned he was in Cuba after international authorities were alerted about the manhunt and the Cuban and Mexican governments exchanged information.\n\nMexican officials say they are speaking with their Cuban counterparts about his possible deportation or extradition to Mexico.\n\nAmerican and Mexican officials have accused Mr. Zhang of being a major player in the drug trade, with links to Mexico’s largest cartels and operations that include drug production, smuggling and money laundering.\n\nMr. Zhang was “an important manager of international money laundering,” Omar García Harfuch, Mexico’s security minister, said not long after his first arrest. Mr. Zhang, he said, was “also responsible for making connections between cartels for transporting fentanyl from China to Central America, South America, Europe and the United States.”\n\nHe also helped lead a drug organization that crisscrossed the United States — including in Georgia, California, Illinois and New York — according to a Drug Enforcement Administration agent’s affidavit filed in a U.S. federal court in Georgia this summer.\n\nThat filing, seeking Mr. Zhang ‘s detention, accused him of leading a vast drug-trafficking and money-laundering network that moved cocaine and fentanyl from Mexico into several U.S. cities.\n\nThat network, court documents said, had operated in the Atlanta and Los Angeles areas since at least 2016, smuggling in large quantities of cocaine and fentanyl for distribution across the United States and channeling the profits back to Mexico.\n\nMr. Zhang coordinated the smuggling and oversaw the distribution, the court documents said, managing stash houses where cash proceeds were collected, counted, and deposited into U.S. bank accounts he controlled.\n\nAn investigation found about 150 companies and 170 bank accounts connected to Mr. Zhang’s organization, the court documents said, with about $20 million deposited in accounts it controlled in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAlan Feuer contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/politics/trump-supporters-venezuela.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:17:12-04:00","title":"Trump Supporters Are Uneasy About Military Actions Against Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is escalating military actions in Venezuela and the Caribbean, launching lethal strikes against civilian boats linked to drug trafficking and building a large military presence in the region.

Mission creep. U.S. military intervention overseas.\n\nFor years, many of President Trump’s ardent supporters rallied around his pledge to avoid another “forever war” after the long U.S. conflicts in the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\nNow, several prominent conservative policy advisers and commentators are raising concerns about the administration’s expanding military actions against Venezuela and in the Caribbean.\n\nThey say the hawkish views that led Democratic and Republican administrations to perpetuate wasteful wars are coming to the fore again, as Mr. Trump’s top aides move to try to depose Nicolás Maduro, the autocrat who leads Venezuela.\n\nSince early September, the United States has launched a series of lethal strikes against civilian boats that American officials say are involved in drug smuggling and built up a force of more than 10,000 U.S. troops, warships and aircraft in the region.\n\n“There’s supposed to be incentives for ending wars and conflicts around the world,” Laura Loomer, a far-right activist and influential outside adviser to Mr. Trump, said in an interview. “Yet, here we have this conflict with Venezuela that is only going to escalate.”\n\nOn a recent episode of his podcast, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, posed the question: “Is this just a breeding ground for neocon 3.0?”\n\nHis guest on the show, Curt Mills, a conservative policy analyst, said the United States should avoid bloodshed and later wrote online that “avoidable catastrophe continues to loom.” In another post, he said, “We’re getting down to the Real Business of murdering people randomly with no plan.”\n\nMr. Mills, the executive director of The American Conservative, Mr. Bannon and some other restraint-oriented analysts view Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and national security adviser, with skepticism.\n\nMr. Rubio was labeled a “neocon” for years by conservative and liberal analysts. Neoconservatives are policymakers and advisers who promote aggressive U.S. intervention overseas to make other societies more pro-America and pro-democracy, including through toppling governments. They pushed for the Iraq war, and the disastrous consequences made the movement unpopular.\n\nAs a Republican senator representing Florida and as the son of anti-Communist Cuban immigrants, Mr. Rubio advocated the use of U.S. military power around the globe. He has since tempered some of his Cold War-style public rhetoric.\n\nBut on Latin America, he has stuck to his traditional policy views, which are focused on weakening and possibly toppling the leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nMr. Rubio is now creating a strategy to use military pressure and other means to try to oust Mr. Maduro, American officials say. He is casting it as an “America First” effort that could help stop the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States, even though armed conflicts often lead to refugee crises.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, and Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s chief domestic policy adviser, have supported Mr. Rubio’s aggressive strategy.\n\nMr. Trump has authorized the C.I.A. to take covert action inside Venezuela. And the U.S. military has been drawing up plans for operations in the country, though those have not been approved by the White House.\n\n“The regime-change stuff is what I’m most skeptical of,” Mr. Mills said. “I think that is just so politically hypocritical. Trump ran against the deep state, and now we’re going to cooperate with the C.I.A. to overthrow a government? It doesn’t pass the laugh test.”\n\n“Trump has been very clear — he has a phobia of regime-change wars,” he added. The American Conservative, where Mr. Mills works, was founded in 2002 by Patrick J. Buchanan, a conservative isolationist, and argued against the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nMr. Mills said the U.S. military’s killings of civilians in the Caribbean without due process “has implications for the way the government will treat its own citizens.”\n\nMr. Trump, Mr. Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have overseen the campaign of airstrikes against civilian boats, which has killed nearly 40 people. Most of the strikes have been in the Caribbean Sea, but the administration expanded its campaign this week, hitting vessels in the Pacific.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides insist the boats were smuggling drugs but have not presented evidence or stated a clear legal basis for the strikes.\n\nHowever, legal experts and foreign policy analysts say there are strong indications that the administration is not killing important drug traffickers. They point to news interviews with some of the victims’ families. And they say it is telling that the administration sent two survivors of a deadly U.S. strike on a boat last week back to their home countries of Colombia and Ecuador instead of detaining and prosecuting them.\n\nOfficials in the region have also said that some of the civilians killed were fishermen.\n\nThe president of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, accused the United States of murdering a Colombian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, in a Sept. 15 attack. Colombian civilians were also among those killed in a boat attack on Oct. 3, Mr. Petro said. Mr. Trump has responded by calling Mr. Petro an “illegal drug dealer” governing a nation producing cocaine.\n\nMr. Trump also said the United States would halt aid payments to Colombia and raise tariffs on imports from the country, a tax paid by U.S. companies.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Rubio argue that the United States has a right to take lethal measures against drug cartels. Mr. Trump points to Venezuela as a major source of fentanyl entering the United States, though that is false.\n\nMr. Rubio supported the first Trump administration’s attempt to depose Mr. Maduro, and he has stressed that the Venezuelan leader is a fugitive from a 2020 Justice Department indictment on drug trafficking charges. The State Department increased a reward to $50 million for information leading to Mr. Maduro’s arrest and conviction.\n\nWhen asked to comment for this article, Tommy Pigott, the State Department’s deputy spokesman, said: “President Trump promised to secure our border, combat narcoterrorists and stop the flow of deadly drugs into our country. He is doing just that. Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela; he’s a fugitive of American justice who undermines regional security and poisons Americans.”\n\nTo placate Mr. Trump, Mr. Maduro has offered the United States dominant stakes in Venezuela’s oil and mineral wealth and has continued to accept U.S. deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants. But on Oct. 2, Mr. Trump called off efforts to reach a diplomatic agreement with Venezuela, according to U.S. officials.\n\nMs. Loomer has questioned why the Trump White House is backing away from diplomacy with Mr. Maduro. She said she supported Mr. Trump’s stated policies of achieving energy dominance and limiting China’s influence in the Western Hemisphere. The easiest path to reaching those goals, she said, is to engage with Mr. Maduro and get him to give the United States more access than China to Venezuelan oil.\n\n“I don’t know if President Trump has been fully briefed on the level of control that China currently has there,” she said.\n\nMs. Loomer has also publicly criticized María Corina Machado, the main opposition leader in Venezuela, saying that she is “actively stoking and promoting violent regime change.”\n\nScholars at Defense Priorities, a bipartisan research center that advocates military restraint, are also increasingly critical of the Trump administration’s actions in Latin America. Several fellows from the group are political appointees in the administration, notably in the Defense Department.\n\n“It does seem like a replay, especially of the global war on terror,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, the center’s director of military analysis. “You see people like Secretary Hegseth saying this is the new Al Qaeda. No. 1, the use of Al Qaeda, more generally, as this boogeyman out there to justify all sorts of adventures in the Middle East is something that restrainers would push back on. But also, the cartels are nothing like Al Qaeda.”\n\nDaniel DePetris, a fellow at the center who researches Latin America, said Mr. Trump is a “primacist” when it comes to the Western Hemisphere — meaning the president is intent on maintaining American dominance across the region, largely through military force.\n\n“This is another instance of Trump using the military hammer and elevating military solutions to problems that don’t have military solutions,” he said.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump appears reluctant to publicly discuss regime change, Mr. DePetris added, Mr. Rubio is clearly driving policy in that direction: “Marco Rubio is using the drugs as a way station to convince Trump to go into Caracas and get Maduro out of there.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/adams-endorse-cuomo-nyc-mayor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:59:08-04:00","title":"Eric Adams Will Endorse Andrew Cuomo for Mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mayor Eric Adams, after ending his re-election campaign, has endorsed former Governor Andrew M.

The employees have been furloughed for three weeks since the government shutdown began.\n\nThe agency said it would fund the restoration of daily operations with user fees collected from sharing data with researchers.\n\nThe agency did not respond to a query about how many workers would be recalled. But according to its contingency shutdown plans for staffing, about 3,000 employees, or nearly half the agency’s work force, appear to be affected.\n\nOpen enrollment for Medicare runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. During that time, older people and others eligible because of disabilities are allowed to change the type of coverage they want through the government’s website. They can either choose the traditional government program or select a Medicare Advantage plan offered by a private insurer. They can also switch from their current plan to another. About 69 million people receive Medicare benefits.\n\nWhile Americans are supposed to begin enrolling in Obamacare plans for next year on Nov. 1, the standoff in Congress over the future of expanded subsidies that expire at the end of the year is already creating alarm and confusion. If Congress ends the more generous subsidies, prices paid by individuals are expected to more than double, according to an analysis by KFF, a health research group.\n\nAbout 24 million people are enrolled in Obamacare.\n\nAbout a dozen states are already allowing people to view their costs without the additional subsidies. But the federal site, healthcare.gov, which manages the marketplaces for 28 states, has so far not published any information about next year’s plans and how much they would cost someone signing up.\n\nThe agency has declined to comment on a specific timetable to allow people to shop for plans before open enrollment begins. It also did not reply to questions about whether the government shutdown had delayed opening the portal for shopping before Nov. 1.\n\nOn Monday, the outage at Amazon Web Services reportedly affected the Medicare enrollment website nearly all day. It was not known whether any disruptions experienced by those trying to sign up influenced the agency’s decision to recall workers.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/opinion/no-kings-trump-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00+00:00","title":"Global Health Advisory Sparks Community Action in Response to Emerging Health Risks","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent public health advisory from the World Health Organization on April 4, 2023, has prompted a widespread response from public health officials and community leaders.

What Do Democrats Have?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T05:05:15-04:00\n\nThe Conversation convenes this week with the Opinion columnist David Brooks, the contributing Opinion writer E.J. Dionne Jr. and the former host of NPR’s “All Things Considered” Robert Siegel to discuss and debate Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral run, gerrymandering and what the No Kings protests achieved.\n\nBelow is a transcript of an episode of “The Opinions.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nRobert Siegel: I’m Robert Siegel, now a contributor to Times Opinion. I’m in conversation with two old friends, both of The New York Times. Columnist David Brooks: How are you?\n\nDavid Brooks: How are you?\n\nRobert Siegel: And contributing Opinion writer E.J. Dionne.\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr.: Great to be with you, always.\n\nSiegel: Once again, we’re together to talk about politics — and there is no shortage of things to talk about. Last month we started off with the question of authoritarianism. Do all the various claims of new presidential powers amount to a loss of fundamental liberties? Well, it seems that several million Americans think so.\n\nThey turned out all around the country to protest against kings. So let’s start there.\n\nE.J., what did you make of the No Kings protests? What did you see in it? And what did you make of the reactions to it?\n\nDionne: Well, I went down to the one here in D.C., and what I saw was patriotism.\n\nThe symbol that was most on offer everywhere along the march route was the American flag. There was even one part of the march where a bunch of people respectfully held out a very large American flag, and little kids were running underneath the flag — because there were a lot of kids there with their parents. It was a very, if I may say so of a march in D.C., a Middle American march.\n\nI think you saw that in a lot of parts of the country. And I think it put the lie to something that I found really disturbing from Speaker Mike Johnson — and others on the Republican side said this — they referred to it as the Hate America rally. It couldn’t have been more different than that.\n\nSince we are on authoritarian watch here, I think it was such a disturbing thing for him to say, because if you are opposed to his party or opposed to the president he supports, that means you hate America. One party, one leader, one country is something that our soldiers fought against in many wars. That’s not a conception of Americanism.\n\nA lot of those people who were marching were very aware of the acceleration of the move toward authoritarianism. You think of the prosecution, the indictments of James Comey, Letitia James, John Bolton — the first two utterly without reason, except that the president hates them.\n\nI think the people at this march weren’t ideological. They were just deeply concerned about the direction of the country.\n\nSiegel: Well, David, you called for a national movement as what we need — first in a column back in the spring, and most recently in a longer piece in The Atlantic. Is the No Kings movement the movement you had in mind? Does it fit the bill?\n\nBrooks: It’s getting there. It’s weird for me; I’m not a movement guy — I’m more conservative than not, and now I find myself reading Saul Alinsky and all these lefties. I’m going, “Yeah, power to the people.” So I’m going total revolutionary here.\n\nDionne: It’s about time, David. [Laughs.]\n\nBrooks: What I liked about No Kings rallies was just what E.J. mentioned: that people like me, who are kind of center right, would feel completely at home there.\n\nIf it starts looking like Occupy Wall Street, then I think: Good for you people, but it’s not for me. I’m hanging around Occupy and my hair starts falling out. But around No Kings, I just feel it’s pro-American. It’s basically in line with the cultural DNA of this country. So I’m very impressed by it.\n\nI think a couple of reservations I have — not criticisms, but things that are not yet there — if you look back at social movements that have succeeded, they’re decentralized. They happen all over, but there are always central collaborating committees. You look at the civil rights movement and they had the N.A.A.C.P., all these acronyms of all these organizations who were leading.\n\nSecond, I do think you need leaders, and I think sometimes, like Occupy, people are averse to having one person at the top. But without that, you can’t control your message. You can’t really conduct a strategy.\n\nThe civil rights movement conducted a soap opera every day. They told the story every day about segregation, and through that repeated storytelling, you really built the movement. You gave the segregators an unwinnable proposition. When you control the streets, either they cede the streets to you or they crack down on you and look like monsters. And that’s a way to achieve civic power.\n\nThe final thing that I think No Kings is so far not making is a vision. Donald Trump has a vision. Trump is a culture. He has a core story: The elites have betrayed you. But he doesn’t only have that story. He has a culture of MAGA, a culture of what a man looks like, what a woman looks like. He has a religion, basically, if you looked at the Charlie Kirk memorial service. He gives you identity. He gives you belonging.\n\nIt takes a counterculture to best the culture that Donald Trump is leading. And so far, the Democrats don’t have that; they have a bunch of tax credits. And so far, the No Kings movement doesn’t have that.\n\nDionne: There was a lot of stuff in your piece I appreciate. I particularly like the line where you said Trumpism is seeking “to amputate the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, science and the pursuit of justice, and supplant those virtues with greed, retribution, ego and appetite.”\n\nThere’s some very good stuff here.\n\nBut I’ll tell you where I take issue with you. You talked about a miasma of passivity that seems to have swept over the anti-Trump ranks. I don’t think that’s true at all. I think that you’ve seen this movement grow.\n\nI think that what is making things difficult is, in our history, I think it’s fair to say that we have never confronted a government that was willing to break the law as freely — not just break norms, which they haven’t cared about for a long time, but break the law as freely.\n\nWe haven’t seen a situation where all of the institutions of government are behaving in a partisan way. The Congress is behaving in a partisan way. And on many of these cases, most so far, the Supreme Court is behaving in a partisan way.\n\nSo people are trying to find purchase here. Where we partly agree is on this need for a strong movement across the country.\n\nI read a very good book this week by Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown called “Rural Versus Urban.”\n\nI think that you need to revisit organizing all the way down in the country, and you need to put pressure on Republicans. Because until some of the Republicans who clearly know better are willing to say so, it’s going to be very hard to break this power that Trump is amassing.\n\nBrooks: Well, he has the core story that people believe in: The elites have betrayed you. The passivity I was talking about was not so much at the bottom, though. I do think it’s there. It’s at the top.\n\nDionne: There, I agree with you.\n\nBrooks: It’s the head of the companies, it’s the head of universities, the head of law firms. They’re just lying low — in part because they’re intimidated, in part just because of the collective action problem. Who’s going to step out first?\n\nI had a friend, a business leader, who went to Europe and he said, “We’ve lost faith in the United States forever.” And I said, “It’s like Taylor Swift: ‘We are never getting back together.’”\n\nAnd the European said something interesting: It’s not because you elected Trump. We all have Trumps in our countries, so any country could do that. It’s because you didn’t rise up.\n\nHe’s looking at his business leaders, and he’s seeing them say something in private about how awful things are going, and then in public speaking a very different language. And you can measure the amount of authoritarianism in a country by how high the price is to oppose it.\n\nDionne: Totally agree about a lot of business leaders, but let’s look at some real pushback. Some law firms went over to Trump, but a whole lot of law firms said: We are not going there.\n\nThey went after Jimmy Kimmel, a whole lot of people protested, and Jimmy Kimmel was put back on the air.\n\nA lot of universities are saying no to what Trump is doing. So I totally agree with you that I want more pushback from people at the very top of the economy, but I think you’re seeing seeds of revolt that are very useful.\n\nSiegel: But let me ask you both this: David, your article made me think back to the civil rights movement and my extremely minute role as a onetime member of the Stuyvesant High School Friends of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\nDionne: God bless you.\n\nSiegel: The civil rights movement achieved a major Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, constitutional amendment against poll taxes. After the restoration of the Medicaid tax break, I don’t know what the agenda of the No Kings movement is. I assume they can’t enact it now, but I don’t even know what would be on the wish list.\n\nBrooks: I think that’s the wrong way to think about it, with all due respect to my friend. You went to Stuyvesant High School. That shows you’re smarter. [Laughs.]\n\nBut I don’t think the anti-Trump forces understand the nature of the fight, which is that Trumpism didn’t emerge overnight. It started, in some ways, back in the 19th century, with Know Nothing.\n\nBut it really started with people like Sam Francis and Christopher Lasch with his book “The Revolt of the Elites.” There was a big intellectual movement, and Trump just picked up everything Christopher Lasch wrote in that book in 1995. So what you need is a whole movement and a vision, and it has to be intellectual first.\n\nWhat I think Democrats need to do is understand that they can’t go back to their core narratives. Democrats have had some great narratives. The New Deal: We’re going to soften capitalism and make it more humane. In the 1960s: We’re going to take people who’ve been marginalized and we’re going to give them respect. Those are great narratives, but they’re not narratives right now.\n\nThe final thing I’d say is there’s a Bulgarian political scientist who made the observation that once the revolution happens, everybody changes. So, it’s not just the Republican Party. He makes a point that the Democratic Party is going to change just as much as the Republican Party. And then he makes the point that once the revolution happens, you can’t go back to who you were.\n\nHe phrases it this way: “You can have Kerensky before Lenin, but you can’t have Kerensky after Lenin.” And Kerensky, for those who didn’t go to City College in the 1930s, was a sort of a Democrat before the Russian Revolution. Once Lenin comes along and creates the revolution, you’re not going to go back to the moderate Kerensky.\n\nSo I just emphasize how radically different people have to think about where we’re going to be in five years.\n\nSiegel: Well, on that note, let’s turn to the races that are on the ballot in November. The odd-numbered year after the presidential election always draws our attention to New Jersey and Virginia, which elect a governor in that year, and of course New York City, which elects a mayor in that year.\n\nAnd this year, there’s a special interest in a California referendum on congressional redistricting. David, which of these races do you find especially interesting?\n\nBrooks: I’m going to go to where E.J. wants to go, because I am a good friend: Mamdani.\n\nI’m profoundly impressed by how much the Democrats want to be the party of rich people. If you look at how Mamdani did against Cuomo in the primary, Cuomo did very well among working-class voters and Mamdani did very well among workers making $200,000 a year.\n\nHe is a perfect candidate for educated elites. His dad is a professor. His mom’s a filmmaker. Nothing wrong with that. My dad was a professor. He has the cultural values and progressive politics that go over well in Prospect Heights or in Park Slope — these are neighborhoods in New York — and would go over well in Santa Monica, would go over well in various affluent places.\n\nBut to me, the core problem for the Democrats is they need to win the working class back. And if he’s their face, which he is about to be, I just think that’s a setback to the core problem for the Democratic Party.\n\nSiegel: But isn’t he running against the high cost of living? No one can afford an apartment at the rate things are going.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, but he’s doing things that are outside the mainstream. Our colleagues on the editorial board produced a data-strewn editorial, and it was basically about something called the center voter theory — that you run to the center and you win by running to the center.\n\nThat may not be true in New York, because New York has a lot of rich progressives, but it’s generally true. So running to the center is probably a smart thing to do.\n\nDo Mamdani’s ideas appeal to me? No. I don’t think government knows how to run a grocery store. New York already has a lot of great family grocery stores. That’s one of the beauties of New York: There are bodegas everywhere. His ideas sound good if you haven’t lived through socialism, but socialism is still socialism.\n\nDionne: I find it amazing, David, that you’re saying that the richest people in New York support Mamdani.\n\nI wish I could do a really good Bernie, but “the millionaires and the billionaires” are all supporting Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. I looked at the great map The New York Times had of the primary — every precinct facing Central Park except one little one way up in the northwestern corner.\n\nBrooks: I didn’t say the millionaires and billionaires. I said $200,000. That’s his sweet spot.\n\nDionne: It’s sort of $50,000 to $200,000. And I think that what’s interesting about Mamdani — two things.\n\nOne, let’s celebrate the paperback of your new book, “How to Know a Person,” and Mamdani acts like he read your book.\n\nHow did he start his campaign? He went to the Bronx when he was at 1 percent in the polls and went to precincts where Donald Trump did well or better than a Republican had done in a long time and he asked people: Why did you vote for Trump? Or: Why didn’t you vote at all?\n\nWhat did they tell him? They said they were worried about the cost of living. How did he orient his campaign?\n\nYou can argue with this or that proposal, but the entire campaign has been oriented around not cultural issues — he’s a cultural progressive, but that’s not what he talks about. He talks about the high cost of housing, he talks about the high cost of child care, the high cost of groceries, the high cost of transportation. He has run an economically based campaign to say New York should be affordable to everybody.\n\nAnd I wrote a column in The Times saying that he was a “sewer socialist,” which to many people might sound like I’m running him down, but I was actually building him up. Because the kinds of socialists who have succeeded in American history — there was a big movement for municipal socialism; Dan Hoan was mayor of Milwaukee for 24 years as a socialist — focused on fixing problems: fixing the sewers, which are making people sick in working-class neighborhoods.\n\nBernie Sanders, who was a mayor, talked about making sure the snow was picked up in working-class neighborhoods. So, it’s snow socialism to sewer socialism. I think he is very grounded and down to earth, and he is running, in an odd way, a campaign that’s quite related to that New York Times editorial that you referenced, even though its underlying message was rather different from Mamdani’s.\n\nBrooks: Look, I love pragmatic leaders. Mike Bloomberg, he was my version. I think New York worked a lot better after Mike Bloomberg.\n\nThere was a guy in Detroit — Duggan I think was his name, Mayor Duggan. And he was the least charismatic guy on Earth. But he said: If you want your streetlights to work, I’m your guy. He was just a boring administrator. I love those guys. And so if Mamdani was like that, I’d be all for it.\n\nAnd I should say he’s a great campaigner. He’s one of the more interesting people in American politics right now. So I don’t take that away from him. But he is an ideological person. There’s a reason he’s a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has gone further left. A lot of the people I’d like to run the D.S.A. have all quit.\n\nThen the final thing to be said is he’s got to explain why New York is so unaffordable.\n\nHouston doesn’t have this problem. If you look at where people are moving, almost every fast-growing state is a Republican state with low taxes and low housing regulations. So people are moving to Tennessee, to Texas, to Florida, to South Carolina, because they create a positive business climate.\n\nNew York has spent all of our lifetimes — and I grew up there like you; we were in the same housing project — it’s had the rent control. It’s had horrible zoning regulations. It’s just super hard to build. I think the vacancy rate in New York apartments is like minus zero, so there’s just not enough housing.\n\nThis is something I think about all the time. I love a book called “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” by Jane Jacobs. Growing up, we were all told she was a hero. She saved the West Village, and that guy Robert Moses, who was putting in all these highways, he was the villain. But now it’s looking like Jane Jacobs taught everybody that if you block the government, you can stop them from doing anything.\n\nSiegel: This is to block the Lower Manhattan Expressway from going through.\n\nBrooks: Suddenly, the story looks a little more complicated, because we’ve had 50 years of blocking all development. And this is the point our colleague Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make in their book “Abundance,” or Yoni Appelbaum in a book named “Stuck.”\n\nThe abundance movement is an effort to get some of the zoning regulations reduced, not out of some Reaganite policy, but just because we need to be able to build things anymore. And I have my doubts that somebody that ideological is going to reduce the grip that the government has on the housing market.\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: What’s ironic is that Mamdani actually did an interview with Derek Thompson where he endorsed some of the core principles of abundance, and argued that you judge a government by whether it can deliver, and that he thinks that abundance raises questions that people who want government to work and want government to work on behalf of working people need to address.\n\nSiegel: OK, one other question about Election Day coming up, which is about the California referendum. My question to each of you is: Is gerrymandering OK if the other guy did it first?\n\nDionne: Well, I think the answer is — the logic of what I’m going to say is yes.\n\nSiegel: Yes is what you’ll say.\n\nDionne: I’ll give you the answer straight up and then get there. I am, like a lot of people who are for the commissions like the one California cast, I think it would be better ——\n\nSiegel: You’re against politicians selecting their voters rather than voters selecting their politicians.\n\nDionne: Yes. And so, if you had a commission system or some sort of nonpartisan plan of making districts in every state of the country, that would be great. That’s what I’m for.\n\nIn the absence of that, when one party — on the order of the president or the request of the president — goes and redraws its district lines in Texas to say “We’re going to arbitrarily create five more congressional districts” and then other states start following and say, “Well, we’ll create more Republican districts,” then the other side can either say, “Gee, this is terrible, but we’re still for commissions,” or they can do what the Democrats and Governor Newsom did in California, which is say, “We’re still for commissions, but we’re going to draw lines to offset those five so we have a fighting chance in the election.”\n\nAnd Barack Obama — who is somebody who’s been fighting partisan redistricting and is one of the most effective advocates out for Prop 50 in California precisely because he liked nonpartisan redistricting — in this circumstance, he regards it as an emergency.\n\nBrooks: You know, there was an essay written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan years ago — I’m hitting all your sweet spots — that was called “Defining Deviancy Down.”\n\nThis is what it looks like: Donald Trump defines deviancy down. We’re redistricting. We’re just going to pick our voters. And then Gavin Newsom matches them.\n\nAnd the people who should be offended, by the way, are the voters of California and Texas. If you live in those two states, you are basically being disenfranchised because you will be living in a district where the election outcome is predetermined.\n\nThere should be outrage about this. People fought for their vote, to have the right to vote, and now people don’t care. To me, the worst example of defining deviancy down is what we’ve come to tolerate, just in how our politicians speak and in the crooked ways they rig the map, and suddenly nobody’s bothered by this. Where’s your dignity, people?\n\nThen the question I would ask E.J. is: Who was right, Obama or Newsom? And I mean Michelle Obama.\n\nShe had this famous comment years and years ago: “When they go low, we go high.” Gavin Newsom, maybe it’s unfair to him, but the other alternative is: When they go low, we go lower. Put aside morality. What’s the smart thing for Democrats to do? It’s not obvious to me that sinking to the moral level of MAGA is the right answer here.\n\nIt seems to me, if people want to turn the page on this moment, they’re going to want to turn the page in the way — and this is not a great example — of Jimmy Carter after Watergate. They’re going to want to say: I want somebody so clean, somebody who respects government, somebody who plays by the rules, who will uphold the norms that I remember. And it seems to me that’s actually a smarter play for Democrats.\n\nNow, I understand the temptation. You can’t hand away the House in 2026. So I understand the temptation. But it seems to me the long-term play here is to go high when they go low.\n\nDionne: Just for the record — in Texas, the State Legislature is imposing those districts on the people of Texas. In California, they are going to the voters. The voters of California themselves are going to decide in this referendum whether they think this is a necessary thing to do now or not.\n\nMy friend here, of course, always quotes Moynihan for his purposes, but I think that what Moynihan counseled very much throughout his career was political realism. This is not about some abstract argument of who goes lower or higher.\n\nOf course, there’s stuff Trump does that no one should do. But in a straight-up political fight where power is at stake and where the authoritarianism we talked about earlier in our conversation really needs somebody to check it, winning that next fight really matters.\n\nAnd again, this proposal they put in California acknowledges that this is not the ideal way to do it. It’s a temporary expedient.\n\nBrooks: If I could just say, I’ve heard this argument that in California the voters get to decide — and I just don’t understand it. There are multiple forms of democracy. We happen to live in a republic, where we elect people to make decisions for us.\n\nCalifornia has this system of referendum where it’s a direct democracy. I happen to think that’s an inferior form of democracy than electing people who get to make decisions. But it strikes me that Texas is not undemocratic. They’re both versions of democracy.\n\nDionne: You started talking about the people, and the people here — individual voters in California — will have a say on this question in a way they didn’t in Texas. I agree we need a mixed system.\n\nBrooks: We elect congressmen; do I have no say in what my congressman does? No, we elect people.\n\nSiegel: Well, I think we’ll just have to accept you guys differ.\n\nDionne: Would you vote for Prop 50?\n\nBrooks: No comment. [Laughs] I would be sorely tempted, to be honest, just in this one case.\n\nSiegel: A great many people cast their votes, not on the basis of either foreign policy or culture war battles but on kitchen table issues — what’s happening with the price of food, price of groceries, with the price of gasoline at the pump.\n\nLife is pretty rough for a lot of Americans right now, and yet the stock market stays in record territory. It keeps setting records. Is the U.S. riding for a fall, and if not, why not?\n\nDionne: It’s funny, we were talking this weekend — transparency for our listeners and viewers — about the fact that we wanted to talk about this. And right after I hung up the phone, I looked at my email and I had an email from Adam Roberts, an editor at The Economist. It was a newsletter which begins with the words “You are probably more exposed to a looming market crash than you think.”\n\nI think there are a lot of people who are extremely nervous. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the market. I’m a congenital bear who’s predicted 10 of the last two downturns. But I do know that there is a real disconnect between what the market has been telling us and the experience of Americans.\n\nTwo really good stories in The Times this week, Sydney Ember wrote a story with the headline “Lower-Income Americans Are Missing Car Payments,” and she points out that this is one of the clearest indications that low- and middle-income families — the economy’s foundation — could be starting to buckle.\n\nThe day before that, Ben Casselman and Colby Smith had a really good piece about how wealthier Americans, buoyed by the stock market, have continued to spend freely, while lower-income households are hit by inflation and weakening of the job market are pulling back.\n\nSo I don’t think you can have a successful economy if the middle and the bottom are falling out. The wealthy alone cannot prop up an economy.\n\nCall me nervous, not just about the economy itself. I, again, don’t know what’s going to happen in the stock market, but this is a very unhealthy situation that explains why so many Americans are discontent.\n\nBrooks: I don’t believe in timing the market, but I have been tempted for the past year to call my broker ——\n\nSiegel: Go to cash [laughs] ——\n\nBrooks: And pull the vast Brooks fortune out of the market. It’ll hurt the market when you lose that much money [laughs]. But I haven’t done it, and I’m glad I haven’t done it because I’ve been wrong.\n\nThere are some really solid fundamentals. G.D.P. growth is about 3, unemployment around 4, wage growth around 4, rent inflation is going down. So, there’s some good things in the economy. And yet, partly for the reasons E.J. said, and then the economic numbers, and then you look at consumer sentiment — consumer sentiment is in the basement because people feel rotten about the country.\n\nThen the big issue here, which is that everybody is suddenly talking about if we’re on the verge of an A.I. bubble. The reason for thinking we’re on the verge of an A.I. bubble are pretty damn obvious: the combined bill. All these big companies, Meta and OpenAI, they’re spending on the order of $400 billion or $500 billion a year. The total consumer spending on A.I. is $12 billion.\n\nWhat? You’re spending $500 billion next year. And where’s the revenue? Then you add the fact that you can’t just build a chip plant the way you built a Ford plant, where you can use the machinery for 10 years. It’s obsolete in 10 months.\n\nSo you think: Wow, they’re just vastly overspending, as they did in the railways, as they did in the early car. We’re going to have a big crash, and then A.I. will be fine.\n\nThe counterargument to that is that A.I. revenues, while small, are really going up fast. The second thing is, A.I. is not like any other technology. It’s not like the railroads. It’s like inventing omniscience. And maybe this is a remarkable opportunity. They all think so, because they’re all investing zillions of dollars, but it feels a little bubble-ish to me.\n\nSiegel: Well, I’ve heard comparisons to the 2000s and the dot-com crash, the bubble. In an article in The Economist, the Harvard professor Gita Gopinath writes that a stock market decline comparable to the 2000 dot-com crash would wipe out, she estimates, $20 trillion in wealth for American households. That’s the equivalent of about 70 percent of last year’s gross domestic product, and there’s just a lot of money out.\n\nBrooks: I am going to call my broker after. [Laughs.]\n\nDionne: Tell him Robert told you to.\n\nSiegel: Well, look, I think we should wrap up, as we did last time, by finding in the midst of all of this angst some joy, some experience that each of us has had recently, that might be a good antidote to stuff we follow in the news. David?\n\nBrooks: Because my wife likes people, we entertain a lot. I’ve actually found not as many people have people over anymore. We’ll have three or four dinner parties a week sometimes, and I’m exhausted by it. I do a lot of dishes. But I found hospitality is maybe my hobby.\n\nIt’s certainly a great pleasure to me, and one of the things we do is — she has a lot of friends who are musicians. And one of my golden rules of life is never turn up the opportunity to hang around with musicians. So we’ve had a ton of music in the house, and it’s been great — and exhausting. [Laughs.]\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: I agree with David on all of that.\n\nTwo things. One, this a great time of year for sports fans. You’ve got the World Series, the N.B.A. starts, middle of football season. That’s fun.\n\nBut this weekend I’m going up to New York, and our youngest daughter — not the one I mentioned the last time — I’m going to go up to celebrate her birthday, and also walk with her when she early votes in that election in New York that we talked about. And when you can bring together love and democracy, that’s utopia for me.\n\nSiegel: I spent Saturday in New York at my grandson’s bar mitzvah. I am, to use a technical term, still kvelling. And what added to the joy, actually, were other things that happened to be happening at that synagogue that same morning: the welcoming of two people who just converted to Judaism, and the naming of a newborn. I thought it was a celebration of life at some of its richest moments, and I felt very enriched.\n\nDionne: Mazel tov, that’s great.\n\nSiegel: I also feel enriched by hearing from you guys again. E.J. Dionne, David Brooks, Thanks so much.\n\nDionne: Thank you.\n\nBrooks: Thank you.\n\nThoughts? Email us at [email protected].\n\nThis episode of “The Opinions” was produced by Vishakha Darbha.

Career. Will His Fans Let Him Have One?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T05:02:02-04:00\n\nThe Big Fat Party Animal has been both a stock character and a known career path in American comedy for at least three generations. John Belushi provided an early example in “Animal House,” playing a frat brother whose heroic drinking and recalcitrant manners paralleled the persona Belushi had established in real life. Rodney Dangerfield went B.F.P.A. in “Caddyshack” and subsequent slobs-versus-snobs films of his Hawaiian-shirt era, while John Candy brought a gentle sadness to the archetype, the party animal without a party. And of course there was the heir to these past masters, Chris Farley, whose grasping enthusiasm and manic self-destruction brought the B.F.P.A. to its whirling apotheosis.\n\nIt was with this tradition in mind that I boarded the Stavros Halkias Dreamboat Tour bus on a windy April morning. We were in Farley’s hometown, Madison, Wis., where he was interred at the Resurrection Catholic Cemetery — a fact I noted aloud during the first natural pause in conversation. I admit that I had envisioned some telling reaction, and maybe even a graveside vigil that could be written up later. In the polite silence that followed, I realized Halkias did not aspire to join this lineage, and in fact hoped to escape it.\n\nDuring an enthusiastically received performance at Madison’s Orpheum Theater that night, Halkias would joke that he had spent the past several years living each day “like the really good day you give a dog” before taking it to be euthanized. Now, at age 36 — three years older than Belushi and Farley ever got — he seemed to be thinking about his metaphorical appointment with the vet. Previous tours had exacted a nonzero cost in metabolic health, and his stated goal was to end this one weighing less than 300 pounds. He had committed to 10,000 steps every day, something he found most attainable first thing in the morning. So began a series of long walks.\n\nThat morning in Madison, we made it about 50 yards before a young man of college age stopped Halkias to say he loved him, an event I thought was kind of lucky from a reporting standpoint. In another half block or so, Halkias was recognized again. By the time we reached the trail along Lake Mendota that led to the University of Wisconsin, I realized that jotting down these interactions was like recording every time a bird flew overhead.\n\nIf you think you recognize Halkias, you probably do. At 5 feet 7 inches tall and about 300 pounds, he has a 95th-percentile body type that he does not try to hide. His wardrobe centers on loudly patterned shirts and European tracksuits. He is mostly bald above the eyebrows but lets what hair he has grow long, a look he complements with Dahmer-style aviator eyeglasses. His speech is loud and percussive, with the recognizable diphthongs of the Mid-Atlantic working class and enough Baltimore “eau” to make it particular. He sounds like how you would voice a cartoon that looked like him. There is also his laugh, which people often accuse him of faking, but which bursts forth so often that if it was ever an affectation, it seems to have become natural long ago. A high percentage of the people who approached him in Madison turned around after hearing this laugh.\n\nHis standard line in these walk-ups is “Appreciate you, brother.” It is an elegant solution, conveying gratitude while implicitly acknowledging the imbalance of the relationship — in which Halkias does not know his interlocutor, who in many cases knows an alarming amount about him — while minimizing that imbalance with a recognizable expression of shared humanity. The more I heard him say it, the more “Appreciate you, brother” seemed to encapsulate Halkias’s attitude toward his success, which he presented as inexplicable but lately seems more like the product of canny strategy.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Bust\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T05:04:31-04:00\n\nBelow is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts\n\nIs the A.I. economy a bubble? Are we just in the early moments of a technological revolution, or are we overextended and headed for a crash? And if we are watching a bubble inflate right now, what should the government — or for that matter — the individual investor do about it?\n\nMy guest today has a lot of bubble experience.\n\nHe was an economic adviser in the Clinton White House when the dot-com boom imploded, and then he worked for President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the housing bubble and the crash of 2008. Today, he’s a Harvard economist and a contributing writer for New York Times Opinion.\n\nRoss Douthat: Jason Furman, welcome to Interesting Times.\n\nJason Furman: Great to be with you.\n\nDouthat: Jason, we’re going to talk about the economy as a whole and even the long-term future of American growth. But I want to start in the place where a lot of Americans’ thoughts about the economy start.\n\nI had this moment a few months ago when OpenAI rolled out its latest version of Chat GPT, and there was a generally disappointed reaction. You had people who had been A.I. skeptics finally claiming vindication saying, “Look, the A.I. revolution is not delivering as fast as was hoped.”\n\nAnd in that moment, I went in and looked at my very boring mix of mutual funds and index funds, looked at just how fast it had risen in the era of the A.I. boom, and thought to myself, “Man, it seems like I’m invested in what might be a bubble.”\n\nA lot of Americans have had this thought. In the months and weeks since then, you’ve had a lot of talk about how large A.I. and A.I.-related companies loom in the stock market, and I want to start there.\n\nJust how big a part of growth right now is artificial intelligence and everything associated with it?\n\nFurman: A.I. is an enormous part of our macro economy right now.\n\nThere’s two ways to think about the economy. One is demand. That’s the amount of stuff you’re buying. The other is supply — how much you’re producing.\n\nRight now, A.I. is really showing up on the demand side. It’s building those data centers, buying those microchips and, by my estimate, in the first two quarters of this year, 92 percent of the increase in demand in the U.S. economy was due to just two categories in G.D.P. — one called information processing equipment and the other called software.\n\nUltimately, though, what we’re really hoping for is that A.I. shows up on the supply side of the economy, actually helping us do more with less. Certainly some of that is happening, but there hasn’t been anything particularly special about productivity growth to date.\n\nDouthat: Stay on that point you just made about how much of growth and expansion is driven by A.I. That doesn’t mean that absent A.I. data center investments and everything else, economic growth would be zero, right?\n\nFurman: Yeah, that’s right. I don’t think we’d have as much growth absent A.I., but we’d have a different type of growth. A bunch of that A.I. demand is coming in the form of imports, because those chips are being produced abroad, which don’t add to G.D.P.\n\nAbsent the A.I. boom, I would expect that we would have lower interest rates right now because so much capital is being siphoned up by the enormous demands in this sector. If that weren’t happening, we’d have more activity in other sectors like home building and manufacturing.\n\nSo, the A.I. boom is partly adding to the economy and partly crowding out other activities. Just as a really wild, rough guess, that might be 50/50 — half of growth due to the A.I. boom, and then the other part of the A.I. boom is crowding out what would’ve been other sources of growth that we could have had if we didn’t have this.\n\nDouthat: And then something similar is happening in the stock market. Can you, can you tell listeners, what are the Magnificent Seven?\n\nFurman: The Magnificent Seven are seven enormous tech companies — companies like Amazon and Microsoft — that represent a very large fraction of the S&P 500 at this point, and a very large fraction of the increase in the S&P 500.\n\nIf one is wondering why the stock market has risen, you’re largely talking about why are the Mag Seven worth so much more today than they were a year and a half ago?\n\nDouthat: And why are they worth so much more today than they were a year and a half ago?\n\nFurman: It’s because of all this expectation of what their profits will be in the future. Now, there’s some differences between the different companies.\n\nA company like Apple is a little bit closer to buying a utility, where every year they’re going to come out with a new phone. Every year they’re going to sell a bunch of those phones, and you buy it and you are just sort of guaranteeing that cash. So there’s a little bit less expectation of growth there.\n\nBut for a company like Meta, a lot of their value is based on the expectation that they’re going to figure out something about A.I. and that they will also figure out how to make a profit out of that something from A.I. To justify these valuations, you really need both of those: the breakthroughs will happen, but also that the breakthroughs will generate a profit.\n\nDouthat: But all of these companies generally are themselves profitable. The companies that look more like classic start-ups are the companies that are just doing A.I. research and development. And most of those are not publicly traded.\n\nSo you’re not looking at ridiculously high stock market valuations for these companies. But they do have extremely high valuations in some sense. Can you talk a little bit about those companies?\n\nFurman: Yeah. OpenAI, for example, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but it’s pretty hard to buy a share in it. It’s not publicly traded. That’s just the valuation you get when you know they get new investors from venture and elsewhere.\n\nIn one sense, that’s enormous. Goldman Sachs has been built up over a century and OpenAI, which was built up over the last decade, is more valuable than Goldman Sachs.\n\nOn the other hand, 10 percent of the world is using OpenAI, is using Chat GPT and that’s just amazing. Five years ago, basically 0 percent of the world was using it and now 10 percent of the world is using it.\n\nNow, a much smaller percentage of the world is actually paying for Chat GPT. And that’s the big question: First, are six, seven and eight going to be a continued thing like iPhones have become where the small design changes and the camera gets better — or are there going to be profound changes in the way that three and four were? We don’t know the answer to that.\n\nAnd then second, and this gets back to the issue I was talking about before, it’s not just that you need the innovation, it’s that you also need to be able to profit from the innovation.\n\nIf large language models become a commodity where there’s three of them that are absolutely amazing, but they’re basically all the same, it’s very hard to price a commodity at something higher than the marginal cost of delivering that service.\n\nAnd so they won’t make a profit. They won’t justify their valuations if they can’t figure out how to build what’s often called a moat — a way of delivering something unique, sticky.\n\nPeople, once they’re in the Apple ecosystem, they tend to stay in the Apple ecosystem. Is it going to be the case that if you’re in the Chat GPT ecosystem, you can stay there?\n\nDouthat: How much of this — I know this is the impossible question for the economist — but how much of this is just vibes?\n\nFurman: Psychology definitely is a big driver in markets. There’s something enormous going on here. This is not Pets.com. Pets.com was part of the dot-com bubble. It had barely any revenue, barely any business plan, and yet had a pretty high valuation.\n\nThese are companies that already have quite high revenue, enormous numbers of customers, enormous upside. And then how do you quantify all of this? Well, you add the genuinely large thing with some vibes, and maybe that’s where we are today.\n\nDouthat: And in terms of historical comparisons, is there any model from American history or modern history of a single form of technological investment playing this kind of role in the economy or in an economic expansion?\n\nFurman: On the demand side, railroads were probably larger at various points in time in the 19th century, where just enormous amounts of the economy was being devoted to laying track as well as building railroads.\n\nWe’re at roughly a similar scale of where we were in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the fiber build-out for broadband. That was an actual real economy, demand-side activity.\n\nAnd there’s probably some other things in between that have been at a similar scale. We’ve often had — whether it’s the automobile or electricity or airplanes or the personal computer — one thing that was playing a disproportionate role. In many of those cases, that one thing did turn out to be a bubble, but not in every one of those cases.\n\nDouthat: Well, with railroads — and I guess you could say the same thing with the internet — the pattern seemed to be there was a bubble in the sense that people got overextended building out infrastructure before it had a path to profitability, but in the end, they were right to build the infrastructure.\n\nFurman: Yeah. By the way, on railroad, you actually want to say railroad bubbles, because they burst over and over again in the United States, in the U.K. and continental Europe, and my guess is in lots of other countries around the world.\n\nThey just kept making the same mistake of overbuilding track, maybe building duplicative track. But when it all settled out, the railroad was enormously transformative. The internet was enormously transformative.\n\nRadio was another thing, which was a bubble, that was enormously transformative. I don’t have an exact tally, but I think there probably have been more bubbles of things that were actually real, actually big, than these just totally fantastical, unproductive ones.\n\nDouthat: OK. So play bubble advocate for me right now. If you wanted to make the case that this is what we’re looking at right now, that A.I. is a railroad-style productive bubble where the tech is real, but we’re just overinvested and overbuilt, what would that argument look like?\n\nFurman: First, I’d look at the market as a whole. Robert Shiller won a Nobel Prize for his work on ways in which markets could turn irrational. He developed a concept called the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE.\n\nThe Shiller CAPE right now stands at about 40, which says the price of a stock is 40 times the inflation-adjusted average earnings over the last decade. That 40 is the second highest that the Shiller measure has ever been, and it goes back about 150 years.\n\nThe highest was where it got in early 2000 — right before the tech bubble burst. So, the basic standard first thing that financial market people and economists look at to assess the value of the stock market right now is screaming that it is sky high in a way that has never lasted before. That would be No. 1.\n\nNo. 2 would then be to dig into certain companies and go through just what would have to happen to justify their valuations. If it’s a really small start-up, to say their revenue’s going to double every year for the next decade — fine. That definitely happens sometimes.\n\nBut when you already are a big established company and you’re being priced a little bit more like a start-up, what’s the plausibility of that when it requires both the technology to work and you need to figure out how to profit from that technology?\n\nDouthat: You mentioned earlier that you don’t think we’re seeing evidence of that A.I. uptake in productivity data and other statistics, that the use of A.I. in programming or whatever else, is having a fundamentally transformative effect yet.\n\nFurman: Yet. And the “yet” is a really important part.\n\nIf you’re a business and you go out and hire 20 people to figure out how to integrate A.I. into your small business or medium-sized business or large business, and they’re all out there trying to figure out how the chain of stores that you run or the chain of restaurants can use A.I. — if the people you hire don’t figure it out right away, they actually show up in the data as lower productivity because you basically have more people working in that business and it’s not producing a higher output.\n\nNow, that doesn’t mean it’s a mistake to hire those people. They may well figure it out and five years from now you can replace all sorts of people or get all sorts of higher profits and the productivity will show up.\n\nBut in economics, this is called a J curve, where sometimes you go down before you go up, and I think that’s happening in some companies right now. In a sense, A.I. is actually reducing their productivity because they’re busy figuring out how to use it, but they haven’t yet figured out how to use it.\n\nSo, in some sense, it’s not that surprising to me that we’re not seeing the productivity growth from A.I. yet. I do expect that we’ll see some, but it is an open question as to how much. We’ll see.\n\nDouthat: In the argument for a bubble, you would say that if you have extraordinary overextension of investment and you’re in the downward part of the J curve, that makes a bubble scenario more likely?\n\nFurman: Yeah, I think that would be in the case for a bubble.\n\nProductivity isn’t the only thing that matters. We actually had more productivity growth from 2000 to 2005 than we did from 1995 to 2000. So, even after the bubble burst, even after this investment was collapsing, productivity growth was actually very, very strong. It just wasn’t nearly strong enough to justify, you know, the way in which those companies were valued, um, in the year 2000.\n\nI should also say, as an economist, productivity growth actually is almost everything I care about. It tells you what the size of your economy is, it tells you on average what wages will be, our possibility for the future. So, to me, that’s what I’m most focused about and care the most about.\n\nBut definitely for the stock market, it’s just one input.\n\nDouthat: Just to be more anecdotal, there’s been a fair amount of coverage in the last few weeks of these deals where, effectively, the A.I. companies are paying each other and increasing each other’s valuations through these deals with one another — where one company agrees to buy another company’s chips and in return it gets shares in that company.\n\nI may be misrepresenting this slightly, but getting shares in that company and then deciding to purchase chips from that company drives that company’s share price higher. So it’s effectively getting the money that it uses to buy the chips from the increase in the share price of the company it’s investing in.\n\nDoes that to you seem like the kind of thing that happens in bubble environments — companies sort of hyping each other up? Or is that more just what you would see normally in an environment where a bunch of companies are working together closely and are growing quickly?\n\nFurman: Like everything here, unfortunately, there’s two sides to this and I wish I could come down for you firmly.\n\nDouthat: No, no, don’t. I’m going to ask you for the case against a bubble in a moment.\n\nFurman: On this being a bubble, it’s the opacity of these arrangements that would make one the most nervous, and also the circularity of them. There was an old phrase that in a gold rush, the way you could guarantee a profit is being the person that sold the picks and shovels to the miners. And the idea was the person went off to find gold, maybe they found it and got rich, maybe they found nothing and ended up poor — but you were guaranteed money.\n\nRight now, instead of selling them the picks and shovels, you’re in some sense lending them the picks and shovels and telling them that you’ll be repaid if they actually strike gold. So, Nvidia would be the one with the picks and shovels and OpenAI would be the one going off looking for gold in this story.\n\nDouthat: Nvidia is making the chips.\n\nFurman: Yeah. Nvidia is making the chips. That’s like a real actual thing. It’s like a pick and a shovel, but a little bit more sophisticated and complicated to make. And if they were selling them all for cash, you’d say they’re pocketing that money. But in some sense, they’re now not just selling them for cash.\n\nIt’s essentially as if they’re lending them to OpenAI and they’ll get paid back and they’ll get paid back with multiples if OpenAI succeeds. But if it doesn’t, then they won’t get any money or won’t get as much money as they would’ve gotten for selling those picks and shovels.\n\nDouthat: So, in the gold rush economy, even if there’s less gold at Sutter’s Mill or in the Klondike or wherever else than people thought, at least if you’re an investor, the pick and shovel money is going to prop you up. Whereas here, if there isn’t enough gold out there, your investment in the pick and shovel company is also in deep trouble.\n\nFurman: Yeah, and this is something that’s changed. Six months ago, I’d say Nvidia was the pick and shovel company that was guaranteed to lock something in. Now that’s changed and they’re not getting all the money upfront for selling those picks and shovels to people.\n\nThen the second part of this is just the opacity of it.\n\nWe have, in our economy, different ways for a company to get money. One is you sell a bond and bond holders buy it. That’s a way of lending you money.\n\nA second is you go to a bank and the bank is super careful about who they’ll lend money to because they’re incredibly highly regulated.\n\nAnd the third is you go to what are sometimes called shadow banks. These are companies like Apollo and they lend you money, often with fewer questions asked. They themselves face less regulation. And a lot of the lending that’s happening in this sector is happening with companies like Apollo that are shadow banks that are less regulated.\n\nNow, to date, these are enormously profitable, enormously successful companies. They’re incredibly sophisticated. I would, for the most part, bet on them knowing what they’re doing. But, one has to be just a little bit more nervous about them.\n\nDouthat: OK, now argue the other side. Tell me why this is not at all like the railroad bubbles or the dot-com boom. Why should we not be alarmed about the Shiller index being almost as high as it’s ever been?\n\nFurman: The biggest reason I have — frankly, full disclosure — kept all of my money in broadly diversified index funds and haven’t reduced my exposure —\n\nDouthat: We were going to come around to the personal investment question. So, that’s good to know.\n\nFurman: How I’ve answered this question for myself is I think a lot about a speech that Alan Greenspan made in December 1996 where he said there was irrational exuberance in the market.\n\nThere was a lot of reason to think that the market was pretty frothy and pretty bubbly. And what happened after he gave that speech? The stock market ended up almost doubling over the next three plus years and then the bubble burst.\n\nBut if you had bought stocks when Alan Greenspan made that remark, and then you lived through the bursting of the bubble and sold at the very bottom of the broad market, you still would’ve made money.\n\nAnd that type of pattern has repeated over and over again throughout history — that people thought something was a bubble, it went up a whole lot before going down, and it turns out if you call a bubble, but you’re early, that’s not very impressive. That actually means that you were wrong.\n\nThat’s very different from almost anything else. Anything else, you predict it and you’re the first one to predict it, you should get lots of credit. If you’re the first one to predict a bubble, you probably were wrong because it went up a whole lot before it went down.\n\nSo, getting the timing of these is just much, much harder than knowing that eventually there probably will be one.\n\nDouthat: You’ve mentioned already Pets.com, which stands as sort of the paradigmatic example of the overvalued internet company, though honestly, the one I remember most from my college days is Kozmo.com, which I think promised —\n\nFurman: That was a delivery one, right?\n\nDouthat: It was a delivery one.\n\nFurman: That one was awesome. While it lasted, they were just giving you almost free stuff, right?\n\nDouthat: Well, what’s striking about those companies is that, of course, we now have very profitable delivery companies and we now have very profitable pet supply companies online. So, in the long arc of history, there were good ideas there.\n\nBut yeah, Kozmo.com was like, “Well, we’re going to deliver pizza. Oh, you don’t want pizza? Well, we’ll deliver ice cream.”\n\nFurman: I remember getting one of the Harry Potter books from them at midnight the day it was released.\n\nDouthat: So there you go. You were the benefit and beneficiary of that kind of over-excitement.\n\nBut to me, I feel like we don’t yet have the Pets.com and the Kozmo.com of this moment. Again, if I’m trying to talk myself into the idea that it’s too early to call a bubble, you have these big, well-established, extremely profitable companies that are investing heavily in this, but which are not dependent right now on A.I. for all their profits.\n\nThen you have a set of companies that are not yet profitable, maybe never will be profitable, but their revenue is going up. The A.I. companies are on a positive trajectory overall, would you say?\n\nFurman: Oh yeah, they’re on a positive trajectory and they’re real companies with real business models. Now, there are hundreds of others, many of them have not gone public yet. So-called unicorns that are worth over a billion dollars that don’t necessarily have business models — people in the venture industry are still throwing money at them. And I’m sure dozens of those, if not hundreds of them will end up imploding.\n\nBut, you can have lots and lots of failures along the way and it not be a bubble.\n\nFor it to be a bubble, you need the successes to make up for the failures. And it wasn’t just that Pets.com failed, it was that the successes, at least in the short run, did not make up for the failures in 2000.\n\nDouthat: You were in the Clinton White House then, right?\n\nFurman: Yeah, I was.\n\nDouthat: What were you doing?\n\nFurman: I was doing two things simultaneously. One of which was private and I can be really proud of, and one of which was public and is totally embarrassing.\n\nWhy don’t I talk about them in reverse order?\n\nWe were planning a new economy conference, that’s what it was called back then, to celebrate just how awesome and transformative everything was in this new economy. And we ended up in late February announcing that we were going to hold this conference in April.\n\nI just went back and reread the fact sheet for this announcement and I think I probably wrote much of that fact sheet.\n\nIt was just going on about what a high fraction of economic growth was coming from this one sector. Isn’t it amazing? Just look at the disproportionate investment growth, the disproportionate G.D.P. growth, and it’s all coming from the information technology sector. Isn’t that super cool?\n\nSo we announced the conference in late February. The bubble started to burst about two weeks after we announced it. And by the time we held it in April, I think the market was down something like — Nasdaq at least, maybe one-sixth from its high.\n\nIn one respect, that was embarrassing in retrospect, that we were celebrating a new economy even as on the financial side, it was imploding. In another sense, though, we were right in that productivity growth over the next five years was even higher than it was in the five years leading up to that.\n\nSo, in some sense, it was a new economy — just not nearly as exciting as what financial markets thought. So, that was the public thing.\n\nIn private, the Clinton administration was running a project. My memory is that it was called Project Nirvana in an ironic type of way to try to understand what would happen if all of this fell apart — if the stock market fell was one scenario, an investment collapse was another scenario, and to see what we needed to do to be prepared.\n\nMy memory is that we didn’t actually ever get to a real answer, but we largely reassured ourselves that even if the bubble burst, the macro consequences would not be very large.\n\nSo, we didn’t actually prepare anything to my knowledge other than just to reassure ourselves that even the downside was not so bad. And I think that was a good exercise that we went through — and largely was vindicated by what ended up being a pretty shallow recession when the bubble burst.\n\nDouthat: So what do you do as a policymaker if you’re sure there’s a bubble, besides try to reassure yourself that if it bursts, it won’t be that bad? Is there anything in the economic policy tool kit that is like, “Use this tool to safely deflate”?\n\nFurman: There’s probably no safely deflating a bubble. But one thing that matters quite a lot is where interest rates are. And the Fed has a decent amount of influence over interest rates. I mean, they basically set the short-term interest rate and then that affects the interest rates that really matter, which are the longer-run ones.\n\nSo, the classic advice is: If you see asset prices rising really quickly, you probably don’t want to be cutting interest rates.\n\nAnd why do interest rates cut matter for a bubble? Well, you could think about it two ways. One is if you’re getting less money on your bonds, you want to do something to make more money. So you move your money from your bonds to your stocks, and that drives up the value of stocks.\n\nA second is that stock prices are basically like the present discounted value of money you’re going to make in the future. And if you have an idea that’s going to make a lot of money 10 or 20 years from now, and interest rates are high, when you discount that future profit back to the present, you get something very small. When interest rates are low, all of a sudden that future profit is worth quite a lot today and worth a high stock value.\n\nThe classic advice on how to burst a bubble would be for the Fed to raise interest rates. And if anything, this says that if you want to think about the financial part of the economy, they should think about that in addition to the more classic inflation and unemployment in deciding what to do with interest rates at their next couple of meetings.\n\nDouthat: What do you think will happen if this is a bubble and it does burst or leak or diminish?\n\nFurman: We’ve had two bubbles that burst in the last 25 years. One was the tech bubble and the consequences were relatively mild.\n\nThe housing bubble was massively devastating to the economy because it wasn’t just that house prices went down, which mattered for families and consumers, it was also that all the mortgage debt had been thought to be completely 100 percent safe and was used as collateral in other lending throughout the financial system.\n\nThen all of a sudden, you found out it wasn’t completely safe. And a lot of other parts of the financial system experienced problems and runs.\n\nSo which one is this one like? Most of me thinks it’s more like the dot-com, where if this bubble bursts, it’s just the stock market goes down, people spend less. Some businesses invest less. You have a recession, but it’s not a particularly terrible one.\n\nThe one piece of it that makes me nervous, though, is these companies like Apollo that we were talking about before.\n\nI’d like to say that if one of these big shadow banks failed, we would just let it fail in a way that we’re willing to let most hedge funds fail, but maybe we can’t. Maybe they’re too systemic. Maybe they spread their effects throughout the economy.\n\nAnd if all of a sudden you were in a position where you were facing systemic risk because of a largely unregulated financial institution that was doing hundreds of billions of dollars of lending — if this ends up being a problem, that’s where it is.\n\nDouthat: Partially, how we come out of it, then, depends on just the underlying health of the economy. There’s a lot of different indicators in the air.\n\nI feel like people give you different assessments of the underlying state of the economy based on jobs numbers one day and consumer sentiment the next day and manufacturing sentiment the next day — and there’s a lot of disagreement with indicators pointing in a lot of different directions.\n\nWhat’s your assessment of the underlying economic situation?\n\nFurman: There have been two broad disconnects in the economic data this year. One was, for a while, the so-called hard indicators, where you looked at what a business actually did, that were much better than the soft indicators, where you looked at consumer confidence or business uncertainty or what businesses said their plans were.\n\nThat was true earlier this year, this disconnect between the hard data and the soft data. So far, it looks like the hard data was actually vindicated, that all of the complaints about uncertainty, all of the lack of confidence, was not something that seems to have translated into decisions that businesses and consumers made.\n\nIt was more like mood music around politics. It’s like if a pollster comes to you and asks, “What do you feel about the world?” and you say, “Oh, it’s all going terrible. I hate it.” But then you go to the store and spend just as much as what you were spending before.\n\nI’ve devalued, frankly, how much emphasis I place on the importance of uncertainty, which never was very central to the way I thought about economic policy, but it may be even a little bit less now.\n\nThe current confusion in the data — and I should say we haven’t really gotten any government data since the beginning of October because of the government shutdown.\n\nBut the current confusion in the data is that the labor market is slowing quite rapidly, but G.D.P. is growing quite quickly and you see that in the unemployment rate, which keeps ticking up. You see that in the hiring rate, where businesses are hiring at a rate that you would normally associate with recessions.\n\nYou see that in the number of jobs added per month, where we’re averaging less than 50,000 jobs a month, and it used to be 200,000 jobs a month. A pretty big deterioration in the labor market.\n\nAt the same time, the economy in the third quarter, the latest G.D.P. tracking estimate is for growth above 3 percent, and consumer spending is growing, businesses are continuing to invest. So everything that goes into G.D.P. looks quite strong.\n\nDouthat: I want to talk about Trump administration policy and how it might affect those numbers. But just on that point, do you think immigration policy has any effect on any of these numbers? Certainly on employment numbers.\n\nI think you’ve had Trump administration officials saying, “You wouldn’t expect rapid job growth in an environment where we’re deporting people and lots of people are self-deporting relative to the Biden era.”\n\nWhat do you make of those kinds of theories?\n\nFurman: Immigration’s having a large effect on the economy. A couple years ago, we were getting a few million people into the country a year. Now we don’t have a really good estimate of net immigration — but maybe it’s zero, maybe it’s 500,000. And that means you’re going to have slower job growth, you’re going to have slower economic growth, everything else being equal.\n\nAnd in some sense, I wish there were more people in favor of immigration restrictions that just made the honest argument that our goal isn’t to have the highest job growth. It isn’t to have the highest economic growth. It’s to work better for people here in the United States and we’re going to sacrifice on those other metrics in order to do that.\n\nJust to be clear, by the way, I’m not sure I even agree with that argument, but that is an internally coherent one.\n\nDouthat: Yeah. I think you’ve heard that argument from some people in the Trump administration or people arguing for their policies. Obviously, that’s an argument they’re more likely to make in an environment where the job numbers are not great.\n\nIf the job numbers were great, they would just take credit for it.\n\nWhat about tariffs? You wrote an essay for The Times basically arguing that economists, to some degree, got the Trump tariffs wrong — not in the sense that they’ve proven that they were a stroke of genius, but in the sense that there was an expectation that they would be totally disastrous and they haven’t been.\n\nWhere do you think that argument stands now?\n\nFurman: It stands roughly where it stood when I wrote that essay in July. I have no doubt that tariffs have been a negative for G.D.P. growth, a negative for employment growth and a positive for inflation — positive for inflation also being a bad thing, something you’d rather not have.\n\nBut all of those were maybe plausibly on the order of something like half a point rather than something catastrophic.\n\nAnd just to gauge things, the economy normally grows at about 2 percent per year. So, if you do this, then it grows at 1.5 percent per year.\n\nNow, I think that’s a pretty bad unforced error. It works out to be about a thousand dollars for every household, and that’s not a cost that as a policymaker I would want to impose on every household. But it’s also not like the history books are going to remember the year growth was 1.5 percent instead of 2 percent.\n\nDouthat: What about the extent to which the Trump administration seems to have tried to basically exempt or shield artificial intelligence from the impact of tariffs? Because that seems to be part of the story here, as well — that there is this special zone for A.I. where the protectionist agenda doesn’t apply in the same way. Do you think that’s part of the story?\n\nFurman: Yeah, that’s certainly part of the story. Tariff rates are lower than they were originally announced in April, and they’re much lower on things like microchips.\n\nThere was going to be an expectation, under a national security procedure called Section 232, that there would basically be across the board tariffs on microchips. They were expected to be at least 25 percent and that hasn’t happened. So, they’re betting on this sector.\n\nAnd it’s interesting to me, if you look at the original defense of tariffs, a lot of it centered around restoring American manufacturing and American manufacturing jobs. It’s completely failed, at least so far, and it’s obviously still very early. Manufacturing jobs are down.\n\nNow, you’re seeing a lot of defense of the tariffs, some of it is revenue raising — which warms my heart when I hear Republicans getting excited about tax increases, but wasn’t exactly where it started. The other one —\n\nDouthat: Surcharges. We’re calling them surcharges.\n\nFurman: Surcharges, I apologize. Not taxes, just surcharges.\n\nIn the Clinton administration, we had a plan to raise tobacco taxes and we also called that a tobacco surcharge or something like that. So, I’m not going to get too moralistic about Orwellian language when it comes to the tax code.\n\nBut the second argument that you’re hearing is that the tariffs are leading to all this inbound investment into the United States. All these companies and countries are committing to invest more in the United States.\n\nIt’s still too early to figure out whether those promises are real or fake. But what’s notable is if they come about, it might even mean that the trade deficit widens.\n\nSo, what started out as a plan to lower Americans’ trade deficit and revive manufacturing is turning into a plan to increase investment into the United States, raising the trade deficit — and, by the way, taking the main manufactured thing and importing more of it, rather than building it here in the United States. That being microchips.\n\nDouthat: So what will the Trump administration do in the event that the stock market starts going down?\n\nFurman: Well, the first thing that will happen is everything that they criticized previous administrations for doing — both Fed and Treasuries — you’ll see them doing them. In a crisis, you do all sorts of things that you’d rather not do in terms of buying assets or lending to certain parts of the economy and that sort of thing just to keep stuff afloat.\n\nI doubt some of the purity that you’ve heard, for example, from Secretary Scott Bessent, who’s talked about and criticized the big expansion of the Fed’s role in the past. Well, a lot of that expansion happened in crises, and I expect that he would be a pragmatist, not an ideologue in a crisis. And I’m sure Donald Trump would be.\n\nIn fact, we’ve seen him be a pragmatist, not an ideologue in dealing with the financial aspects of Covid in 2020.\n\nSecond, though, I worry about the government directly inserting itself into the sector in advance. They’re buying equity stakes in these companies or getting things that are almost like the equivalent of an equity stake, where they get a fraction of Nvidia’s export revenue.\n\nAnd that, in some sense, says to me that they are more willing to do things for individual companies than you’ve seen in the past.\n\nNow, Bush and Obama basically bailed out the auto industry. The theory, at the time, was that a severe economic crisis — what was basically a liquidity crisis that was temporary — could turn into a solvency crisis and then spread throughout the economy and be very costly.\n\nI think, ex post, they were largely justified in bailing that industry out and much of the money that went into it, but not all of it, was repaid here.\n\nIn 2000, we didn’t do that. Global Crossing went bankrupt. No one in the government tried to do anything about the firm Global Crossing, which was a firm building a lot of the fiber optic cable and switching networks and stuff like that.\n\nMy guess is that the 2000 approach would be the right one here. I could see this administration wanting to be much more interventionist, especially for its favorite companies, and getting involved with them directly in a way that gets in the way of what capitalism and bubbles bursting are supposed to accomplish.\n\nDouthat: This is a theory that I’ve been kicking around for a little while that’s based, in part, on what you described — the Trump administration’s eagerness to be in partnerships and take ownership stakes and so on. But it’s also based on the extent to which the vision of the A.I. future is deeply entangled with issues of national security.\n\nWhen you do exercises and thought experiments about accelerated A.I. timelines, including people we’ve had on the show, they tend to very quickly turn into arguments about the new Cold War with China.\n\nAnd I feel like when you put those pieces together, plus the fact that the Trump administration has made such a bet on A.I., all of that makes me feel like from the point of view of the administration, maybe these companies are already too big to fail?\n\nFurman: Absolutely. I think you do need to inject national security into this conversation in a way that you didn’t really need to in the bursting of the 2000 bubble or the housing bubble. And there are things that are economically costly that you want to do for national security reasons.\n\nIn fact, just in normal times, for example, I would subsidize chip companies to make more advanced microchips in the United States — not because I think it’s a great source of jobs in the United States, not because I think we’re good at making the microchips, just because it terrifies me that almost all of our advanced microchips come from Taiwan.\n\nThere’s all sorts of economic costs you want to pay for national security.\n\nI’d also say one more thing here, which is you want to be very targeted. Intel got a subsidy under the CHIPS program from the Biden administration, and that law was passed with a decent number of Republican votes, as well, to build microchips in the United States.\n\nTo me, that made sense for national security, but was a cost economically. This administration has taken an equity stake in Intel, and the problem is Intel does lots and lots of things, and an equity stake isn’t very well targeted to that one activity that they’re not doing enough of right now, which is building microchips in the United States.\n\nSo, it’s not just that we want Intel, it’s that we want Intel doing certain things and we should be willing to pay transparently for those certain things. I think we have less of that well-thought out targeting now than we had before — and, by the way, it was very far from perfect before.\n\nDouthat: All right. Let’s do a couple of big picture questions before I let you go.\n\nIt seems to me that when I look at the future trajectory of growth in the United States or Europe or the entire developed world, there’s a lot of underlying reasons to be pretty pessimistic. That you have these societies that are aging, that have low — sometimes extremely low — birthrates that are running permanently large deficits.\n\nIn that environment, sometimes it seems like we’re betting so heavily on A.I. because there isn’t any other bet to make and the alternative is just sort of depressing. If this technology doesn’t achieve the kind of takeoff that people imagine, then you’re just headed for a global experience like Japan from the 1990s of stagnation and old age.\n\nAre you optimistic about the long-term future of the American economy otherwise?\n\nFurman: I’m reasonably optimistic.\n\nDouthat: Why are you optimistic?\n\nFurman: We have had, over the last 50 years, nearly 2 percent annual productivity growth. Every year, we basically figured out how to do 2 percent more with a given amount of labor than we did a year before.\n\nThat’s not as high as what we had in the 1950s and 1960s when we were coming off all of the World War II innovations. But that’s pretty cool and impressive that no matter how advanced stuff gets, we keep figuring out how to squeeze out more.\n\nI think A.I. might be how we add on top of that — it might not even add on top of that, it might be how we keep getting to 2 percent each year. But that accumulates and makes a difference over time.\n\nSecond, though, is that my optimism for the U.S. economy does rise and fall a lot with what we do on immigration. Immigration matters both for your labor force and how many people you have to work, which is increasingly a challenge for the United States were it not for immigration. Not every country can overcome unfavorable demographics, but we really can with this.\n\nAnd then immigration also matters for that 2 percent number, that productivity growth, because a lot of that innovation, a lot of the companies we’re talking about are founded by, staffed by, run by, first- or second-generation immigrants. So, to me, a lot of our future does rise and fall with immigration.\n\nI grant you, I would love to see the world have more of a growing population than it has now. And I’d feel better about the next 200 years if I knew either that population was growing or that the robots could do everything else and we could just sit around and chat with each other on podcasts.\n\nDouthat: So, let’s talk about that scenario as the last question. This has been a conversation about what normal economic models and normal historical economic experiences can tell us about the short-term likelihood that we’re in a bubble, what policymakers can do and so on.\n\nBut one of the bizarre things about A.I. is just this fundamental unknowability in the tech right now that just doesn’t seem, to me, to have been the case with the transcontinental railroad or even with the internet.\n\nDerek Thompson, who is a fellow podcaster and a writer on all these subjects, was going through these arguments the other day. He was talking about Pets.com and he says, “Did you know that Pets.com delivers food, drinks and toys?” was a real line from an actual Pets.com ad.”\n\nSo, it wasn’t just Kozmo, Pets was delivering too. But he says, what they didn’t say was, “Did you know that Pets.com will solve Alzheimer’s, invent nuclear fusion, and loosen the icy grip of inevitable cellular death?”\n\nIt’s very easy for me to get guests on this podcast who will make predictions like that about A.I., along with the prediction that it might well kill us all.\n\nAs an economist looking at this landscape, do you just have to set all that to one side and narrowly focus on the numbers in front of you and say, “We have to assume this is a normal technology until it starts to act like one that isn’t”?\n\nHow do you put that into models of our situation?\n\nFurman: I’ll tell you how I handle it in a class that I co-teach with David Laibson. It’s called EC10, it’s the Principles of Economics class. Last year, in our last class, we taught the students exactly the answer to this question, and we gave them exactly the right answer to this question.\n\nWhich is to say, I told them the future would look like the past, and we could extrapolate. David Laibson told them it would be totally different from the past. And one of us was correct.\n\nDo you want know which one was correct?\n\nDouthat: Yes, I suppose I do.\n\nFurman: My argument is we’ve had some big transitions.\n\nFor example, in the 19th century, when the majority of people were working on farms, it’d be impossible to imagine what life would be like in a world where only a few people were able to grow enough food for everyone.\n\nAnd largely the reason the unemployment rate has stayed the same is several things. We create new types of jobs we couldn’t have imagined, we have more demand for old types of jobs. A lot more people eat out at restaurants now than did a hundred years ago because we’re richer.\n\nTechnology often replaces parts of jobs. A.I. is helping radiologists now, but there’s more radiologists than there were ever before. It’s not turning into a radiologist because you need to talk to the patient, coordinate with the other doctor, figure out what model to use.\n\nAnd finally, and this is the scary part of it, new technologies can change relative wages. So, if it partly substitutes for what people do, often they keep their jobs by their relative wages falling. That’s part of what we’ve seen with the increase in inequality over the last many decades.\n\nAll of those forces have kept it so that at any point in time, about 96 percent of the people who want to work can work. And that’s been true, almost every year for a very long time now — except in a recession or something dysfunctional.\n\nLargely, if you’ve seen something for a hundred years, my first bet would be to assume it happens for the next hundred.\n\nI know a set of stories under which the future will be different from the past. A lot of them in the labor market go under the story of horses, where every argument I just said applied a hundred years ago. Now, 300 horses would have as much horsepower as your car, but I don’t think — even for free — you would take 300 horses over a car.\n\nDouthat: I have some children who would make that deal, but I would advise them against it.\n\nFurman: So, that’s the other side of the story is that sometimes things are discontinuous, but there are so many powerful economic forces that have worked for a long time that I’m going to still emphasize them in my teaching — even if my co-teacher is more visionary and feels otherwise.\n\nDouthat: All right, well on that note, I think you have to go teach that class. Jason Furman, thank you for joining me.\n\nFurman: Thanks for having me.\n\nThoughts?

of State Marco Rubio was expected to arrive in Israel on Thursday and has said that the Trump administration is considering seeking a mandate from the United Nations for an international security force to be deployed in Gaza.\n\nMr. Rubio will be the latest in a string of top American officials to visit Israel in hopes of shoring up a fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday, Mr. Rubio said it was “important” for the United States to help “keep the cease-fire together.” The deal has come under strain from a recent flare-up of violence in Gaza and lingering tensions over the exchange of deceased Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe truce is based on a proposal, outlined by President Trump in September, which also envisioned a “temporary International Stabilization Force” in Gaza. The idea was for that force to secure the areas where Israeli troops have withdrawn, prevent munitions from entering the territory, facilitate the distribution of aid and train a Palestinian police force.\n\nBut several countries have been skittish about the idea of contributing troops to such a force because its exact mission in the devastated Palestinian enclave is unclear, and because of concerns that it might bring troops into direct conflict with Hamas fighters.\n\nMr. Rubio said that “going to the U.N. potentially and getting the international mandate” was a step toward “building the international defense security forces.”\n\nHe was expected to land in Israel shortly after Vice President JD Vance leaves the country — back-to-back visits by top U.S. officials that underscore the administration’s keen interest in preserving the cease-fire. Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, have also been in Israel this week.\n\nMr. Trump visited the country earlier this month to celebrate the cease-fire agreement. But several Trump administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, have recently said there was concern within the administration that Mr. Netanyahu might vacate the deal.\n\nBefore departing for Israel, Mr. Rubio also said that American diplomats will soon be assigned to monitor the fragile cease-fire at a new civil-military coordination center in southern Israel.\n\n“There’s a lot of work to be done,” said Mr. Rubio. “But we certainly wanted to make sure that we were there and ensuring that we had the right people in place at the coordination center, which is key to holding this all together.”\n\nMr. Vance, who visited that coordination center earlier this week, said the administration knew that it was “not going to be easy” to secure a lasting peace.\n\nSeveral thorny issues have yet to be addressed — including a stipulation in the president’s 20-point peace proposal that calls for the disarming of Hamas, which the militant group has long opposed.\n\nThe cease-fire agreement that went into effect earlier this month led to an Israeli military pullback within Gaza, and saw the last 20 Israeli hostages held in the enclave exchanged for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n\nIt faced fresh challenges this week from Israeli lawmakers, who approved a preliminary measure for the annexation of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a move that is explicitly prohibited under the terms of Mr. Trump’s peace plan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Rubio said he did not support Israeli annexation of the territory and called the measure “potentially threatening to the peace deal.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/climate/trump-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-oil-drilling.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:42:44-04:00","title":"Trump Opens Pristine Alaska Wilderness to Drilling in Long-Running Feud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has announced plans to resume oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, reversing a 2021 Biden administration cancellation.

2025-10-23T15:42:44-04:00\n\nThe Trump administration on Thursday announced a plan to allow oil and gas drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of the largest remaining tracts of pristine wilderness in the United States.\n\nThe decision was the latest twist in a long-running fight over the fate of the refuge’s coastal plain, an unspoiled expanse of 1.56 million acres that is believed to sit atop billions of barrels of oil but is also a critical habitat for polar bears, caribou, migratory birds and other wildlife.\n\nDuring his first term, President Trump signed a 2017 tax bill that required two oil and gas lease sales in the coastal plain, but the Biden administration later suspended and then canceled those leases.\n\nOn Thursday, the Interior Department said it would hold an oil and gas lease sale in the coastal plain this winter. The agency also said it would reinstate seven oil leases in the refuge that the state of Alaska acquired in 2021 but that had been canceled two years later by the Biden administration.\n\n“This land should and will be supporting responsible oil and gas leasing,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said during an “Alaska Day” event at the Interior Department’s headquarters, which came even as many Interior employees were furloughed during the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nMr. Burgum also announced that the Interior Department had finalized a deal that would allow a contentious gravel road to be built through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Alaska. And he reiterated that the agency would greenlight an industrial road that would cut through pristine wilderness to reach a proposed copper and zinc mine in northern Alaska.\n\nTaken together, the decisions “represent a clear and unified message, which is Alaska is open for business,” Mr. Burgum said.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly promised to increase Arctic drilling as part of his plans to expand U.S. oil and gas production and achieve “American energy dominance.”\n\nYet major oil companies have previously shown little interest in drilling in the refuge largely because of the great expense and some concerns about public relations. It remains unclear whether they will bid in the upcoming auction.\n\nAdding to these challenges, some major banks have committed to not finance drilling in the refuge. And environmental groups are expected to file lawsuits to try to block the lease sale.\n\n“We will fight any attempt to industrialize the fragile coastal plain of the Arctic refuge and every option is on the table,” Kristen Miller, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, wrote in an email.\n\nThe question of whether to drill in this remote refuge has fueled fierce political and legal battles for nearly a half-century.\n\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which designated the majority of the refuge as wilderness and effectively barred drilling there. But congressional Republicans fought to end the ban, and they saw an opening in 2017, when they passed a tax bill that required two lease sales in the coastal plain by the end of 2024.\n\nBoth of those lease sales were widely considered to be flops. The first auction did not garner any bids from large oil companies, and seven of the nine leases were acquired by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state agency that promotes economic activity. The second sale did not attract a single bidder.\n\nThe upcoming lease sale “is not going to have 30 companies making gazillion-dollar bids,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, a Houston-based investment firm. “It’s probably going to be a fairly targeted group of companies that have existing infrastructure in the North Slope, and that list is not super long.”\n\nNo one truly knows how much crude oil lies beneath the refuge, where only one exploratory well has ever been drilled, in the mid-1980s. But the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated, based on seismic data, that the coastal plain contains between 4.3 billion and 11.8 billion barrels of oil. (For context, the United States produced a record 4.6 billion barrels of oil in 2024.)\n\nAt the same time, the refuge is home to the Southern Beaufort Sea’s remaining polar bears, with pregnant females creating dens in the snow to give birth to and raise their cubs. This denning habitat has become even more important as climate change has caused Arctic sea ice to melt and disappear.\n\n“One of the worst things you can do for conserving polar bears is to industrialize their denning habitat,” said Patrick Lavin, an Alaska policy adviser at Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation group. “It’s adding insult to injury when human actions have already resulted in the loss of sea ice habitat.”\n\nAlaska Native groups were split on the decision.\n\nNagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, a group that represents Iñupiat organizations on Alaska’s North Slope and supports oil and gas projects, said the move would provide economic benefits. He noted that taxes on local oil and gas operations had funded basic services such as schools and running water.\n\n“You couldn’t graduate high school on the North Slope until the North Slope Borough built K-12 schools in all of the communities” using oil and gas revenue, Mr. Harcharek said.\n\nBut Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, a coalition of Gwich’in tribal members in Alaska and neighboring parts of Canada that opposes oil development, said drilling in the refuge could threaten caribou that her people have hunted for centuries.\n\n“Opening the coastal plain is a direct threat to our people, our culture and our future,” Ms. Moreland said.\n\nThe Interior Department also unveiled more details on Thursday about another issue that has reverberated across Alaska and the nation’s capital for decades: a land-swap deal that would facilitate a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nWhile details of the deal were not immediately available, it was expected to call for the agency to transfer 490 acres of land within Izembek to King Cove Corporation, a tribal organization that wants to build the road, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. In exchange, King Cove Corporation would give the government thousands of acres of its own land, some of which would be added to the refuge, the documents show.\n\nOpponents of the road say it would cause irreparable harm to wildlife as well as many Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing for food. In particular, they have warned that the road could fragment critical habitat for emperor geese and Pacific black brant geese, which converge on the refuge to feast on some of the world’s largest beds of eelgrass.\n\n“I worry every day about what’s going to happen to the brant and emperor geese if there’s a road in Izembek,” Edgar Tall Sr., chief of the Native Village of Hooper Bay, said in a statement. “Our people hunt these birds together so we can learn from each other and teach our children how to hunt and take care of the land.”\n\nProponents say the road is essential for connecting the remote town of King Cove with an airport that could be used for emergency medical evacuations. Since 1980, at least 18 residents of King Cove have died because they could not receive medical attention in time.\n\n“The Biden administration put the lives of birds over the lives of people,” Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said at the Interior Department event. “That ends today.”\n\nThe King Cove Corporation and local officials in King Cove could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nLisa Friedman contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/well/kim-kardashian-brain-aneurysm.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:53:09-04:00","title":"Kim Kardashian Says She Was Diagnosed With a Brain Aneurysm","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kim Kardashian, the renowned reality television star and entrepreneur, revealed she has been diagnosed with a brain aneurysm during a teaser for the seventh season of her show 'The Kardashians,' which premiered on Hulu.

Says Israeli Annexation of West Bank Land ‘Won’t Happen’\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T15:34:18-04:00\n\nThe next steps in shaping a peaceful, postwar Gaza remain vague, but the Trump administration has made one thing clear. Any Israeli attempt to annex parts of the occupied West Bank will not be tolerated.\n\nPresident Trump drove the point home in an interview with Time magazine published on Thursday.\n\n“It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries,” he said of West Bank annexation. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.”\n\nThe day before the interview came out, the Israeli Knesset, or Parliament, passed two largely symbolic votes in favor of annexing land in the West Bank, a territory that much of the world envisions as the core of a future Palestinian state.\n\nThe United States is Israel’s most important ally and the preliminary votes clearly raised the hackles of the Trump administration, which has worked hard to keep its Arab partners to the Gaza deal on board.\n\nVice President JD Vance, who was wrapping up a two-day visit to Israel on Thursday, vented his anger at the vote. He said someone had told him that this was a symbolic political stunt with no practical significance.\n\n“If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally take some insult to it,” he said. “The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.”\n\nThe Wednesday votes took place on the same day he arrived in the country.\n\nThe messages left Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scrambling to distance himself on Thursday from the votes that angered the U.S. administration.\n\n“The Knesset vote on annexation was a deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord during Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Israel,” he said in a statement issued in English.\n\nThe motions, put forward on Wednesday by two right-wing members of the parliamentary opposition, were largely symbolic and would need several more votes and much committee work to pass into law.\n\nBut talk of annexation has gained more urgency in Israel in recent weeks since countries, including some of Israel’s traditionally close allies, took the step of formally recognizing Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe political maneuvering came at a sensitive time, amid a series of visits to Israel by U.S. officials intended to shore up the fragile Gaza cease-fire that came into effect barely two weeks ago after two years of war.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, about to board a plane to Israel after the Knesset votes, told reporters that annexation was not something the administration “would be supportive of right now.” Such moves could potentially endanger the Gaza cease-fire deal, he warned.\n\nThe administration’s plan for ending the war in Gaza includes as a goal an eventual, credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\n\nMr. Netanyahu of Israel opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state but came out forcefully against the Knesset votes that brought U.S. pressure.\n\nWithout the support of his conservative Likud party, he said, “these bills are unlikely to go anywhere.”\n\nMr. Netanyahu leads the most right-wing and religiously conservative coalition in Israel’s history. Key elements of it want to annex large parts of the West Bank and members of the ultranationalists parties that help make up the coalition, including several ministers on whose support Mr. Netanyahu depends, voted for the annexation bills on Wednesday.\n\nMost of the world views Jewish settlements in the West Bank as a violation of international law.\n\nThe hard-line opposition members who presented the bills have their own beefs against Mr. Netanyahu. And other centrist members of the opposition exploited the votes on Wednesday to embarrass the prime minister and expose splits in his coalition.\n\nAdding to the sense of political chaos in Israel, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister and a staunch advocate for annexation, insulted Saudi Arabia, a regional power that Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu have long hoped will normalize relations with Israel.\n\nIf the price of such normalization is a Palestinian state, Mr. Smotrich said at a conference on Thursday, addressing Saudi Arabia, “No thank you. Keep riding camels in the sands of the Saudi desert.”\n\nAfter his remarks were slammed by members of the coalition and the opposition alike, Mr. Smotrich posted a video on social media expressing some regret. He said his “unplanned” statement about Saudi Arabia “was certainly out of place, and I lament it.”\n\nBut he doubled down on annexation.\n\n“Just as I do not seek, God forbid, to offend the Saudis, I expect them not to hurt me, or to hurt us,” he said.\n\nReferring to the West Bank by its biblical names, he added, “Those who dispute our living and very deep ties to the regions of our homeland in Judea and Samaria hurt us.”\n\nJohnatan Reiss Reiss contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/construction-worker-dies-hudson-yards-nyc.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:49:17-04:00","title":"Worker Dies After Falling at Construction Site for Hudson Tunnel Project","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A construction worker died after falling approximately 60 feet at a Manhattan construction site linked to the $16 billion Gateway tunnel project, which aims to build new rail tracks under the Hudson River to connect New York City and New Jersey.

Andrew M. Cuomo returned to the political arena in March as a candidate for mayor of New York City, he commemorated the moment with a 17-minute video describing the city as a place whose denizens nervously avoid eye contact with mentally ill homeless people as they walk past empty storefronts into foreboding subway stations.\n\nNow, with less than two weeks until New Yorkers elect their next mayor, Mr. Cuomo has darkened the narrative further. Fashioning himself a 21st-century Cassandra, Mr. Cuomo has unspooled a grim prophecy for a city that seems poised to elect as its mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist half his age.\n\n“Besides the practical impact of crime, plunging real estate prices, imagine the publicity nationwide, internationally, New York City goes socialist!” Mr. Cuomo, 67, told a crowd of businesspeople on Tuesday. “You’ll see revenue generators leave, you’ll see government spending increase, you’ll see plunging real estate values, and at worst, you see a redux of the 1970 fiscal crisis.”\n\nHe predicted certain “mayhem” if President Trump tried to “take over” New York City in response to a Mamdani victory.\n\nDuring two interviews on Tuesday, he adopted a similarly gloomy tone.\n\nSpeaking to the YouTube personality Logan Paul, Mr. Cuomo said the city’s fragility necessitated his election. Otherwise, “We could lose New York City as we know it.”\n\nMr. Mamdani’s inexperience might even cost New Yorkers their lives, he told the conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg.\n\n“Any morning can be a terrorist attack; any morning can be Hurricane Sandy,”he said. “If you don’t know what you’re doing, people die.”\n\nAnd during the second and final general election debate on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo suggested only he could “save” the city from what he described as the “hate-mongering and division that is tearing” it apart.\n\nAround the same time the debate was airing, his campaign posted, and then took down, an A.I.-generated video depicting Mr. Mamdani’s supporters as trespassers, domestic abusers, pimps, drug dealers and drunken drivers — as well as a shoplifter depicted by a Black character in a kaffiyeh.\n\nRich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the campaign, said the video “was posted in error” and “wasn’t done yet.”\n\nMr. Cuomo has never been known for projecting a particularly upbeat persona. As a famously combative governor, his administration operated at two speeds, as his top aide described it: “get along and kill.”\n\nBut after Mr. Mamdani trounced him in the June Democratic primary, Mr. Cuomo’s approach has grown even grimmer.\n\n“He is resorting to this language and these tactics because he has nothing to offer to New Yorkers — no vision, no plans, no agenda, nothing forward-looking, just fear-mongering,” said Dora Pekec, a spokeswoman for Mr. Mamdani.\n\nTo many members of Mr. Cuomo’s party, the world does indeed feel vaguely apocalyptic, with Mr. Trump sending troops into American cities, rounding up immigrants, politicizing the Justice Department to target Democratic leaders and defunding projects important to states run by Democrats.\n\nSome Democratic Party leaders have expressed concerns that a victory by Mr. Mamdani may hurt Democrats in next year’s midterm elections or incite Mr. Trump to further insert himself into city affairs. Like Mr. Cuomo, they point to his lack of relevant experience, his prior statements of antipathy toward the police, and his opposition to the existence of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\n“If you’re asking why he’s talking about why the stakes are so high, it’s because the stakes are so high,” said Mr. Azzopardi.\n\nMr. Azzopardi was speaking about New York City, but he may as well have been addressing the situation of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is running as an independent on the Fight and Deliver ballot line.\n\nWith the mayor’s race entering its final 12 days, he remains at least 10 points behind Mr. Mamdani in recent polls, and the odds weigh heavily against him winning, particularly if Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, does not bow out. (Mr. Sliwa has repeatedly said he is staying in the race.)\n\nAnd as Mr. Cuomo faces the prospect of his own political oblivion, he is desperately making a play for Republicans to choose him, a Democrat running on an independent ballot line, over Mr. Sliwa. To do so, Mr. Cuomo has embraced a message that Republicans pioneered.\n\nIn late June, the State Senate Republican Campaign Committee described Mr. Mamdani as “the leader of the socialist fringe that’s going to destroy New York City and our state.”\n\nIn July, Mr. Trump raised the specter of citywide devastation under Mr. Mamdani, and promised to prevent it. “As President of the United States, I’m not going to let this Communist Lunatic destroy New York,” he wrote on social media.\n\nAnd in September, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, a staunch Republican ally of the president, described Mr. Mamdani as a “communist who is on pace to destroy N.Y.C.”\n\nMr. Sliwa has taken a less dire tone about Mr. Mamdani, at times arguing that Mr. Cuomo is the actual looming threat.\n\n“So, I’m supposed to drop out for a loser who destroyed the state?” he said on Newsmax on Monday, when an anchor asked him why he wasn’t leaving the race to help Mr. Cuomo’s campaign. “And you want me to give him an opportunity to put the last nail in the coffin and destroy New York City, too?”\n\nTo Mr. Cuomo’s sympathizers, he is simply speaking truth about the real-world consequences of electing a 34-year-old with a thin résumé and an allegiance to a democratic socialist ethos in the financial capital of the United States.\n\n“If we tax our middle class and high earners out, allow vagrancy on our buses, roll back the police, and stop jailing criminals, what else could be the outcome?” asked Joseph Borelli, a Republican former councilman from Staten Island who has not endorsed in the race.\n\nBut to his detractors, Mr. Cuomo’s fixation on painting such a grim picture underscores his own unwillingness to present an affirmative vision for his possible mayoralty, and his reluctance to grapple with the grim reality that already exists in New York City — from existing affordable housing and homelessness crises to federal officers arresting immigrant vendors near Canal Street.\n\nGustavo Gordillo, the co-chair of the city’s chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, described Mr. Cuomo’s tack as a “Hail Mary” pass that is bound to fail.\n\n“People, if they want to be scared, they look at Trump,” agreed Ana María Archila, the co-director of New York’s Working Families Party. “If they want to feel like their life can change, they look at someone who is not Cuomo for that solution.”\n\nMr. Cuomo, meanwhile, is grappling with what he describes as a new emotion.\n\n“I am afraid, I am afraid for New York City, and I’ve never felt that before,” Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday. “I’ve seen cities spiral and not come back.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/business/economy/us-china-trade-investigation.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:07:48-04:00","title":"U.S. to Begin Investigation Into China’s Compliance With 2020 Trade Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is preparing to launch a formal trade investigation into China’s failure to meet the $200 billion purchase commitment under the 2020 U.S.-China trade agreement.

Should New Yorkers have to prove they are poor in order to live in rent-stabilized apartments?\n\nA fierce debate about who should be able to use government benefits in one of the world’s most expensive cities has animated the mayor’s race in New York in its final stretch, as the two leading candidates offer starkly different approaches to easing the city’s affordability crisis.\n\nThe approach that New York City voters choose next month will likely reverberate across the United States, as other cities grapple with their own surging costs.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, has proposed a significant and costly expansion of New York’s social safety net, including free buses and free child care for all, regardless of income.\n\nHe has said he believes that “city government’s job is to make sure each New Yorker has a dignified life, not determine which New Yorkers are worthy of that dignity.”\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has said that Mr. Mamdani’s agenda amounts to “subsidizing the rich.”\n\nHis own affordability proposal, released after his loss in the Democratic primary, would expand access to a slew of government programs for struggling New Yorkers whose incomes fall just above the cutoff to receive benefits.\n\n“I focus on working families,” Mr. Cuomo wrote on social media recently, deriding Mr. Mamdani as a “mansion boy” who “focuses on helping the rich.”\n\nThe question of which New Yorkers should get government services is both politically urgent and emotionally charged.\n\nAbout three in four New Yorkers cut back on basics and savings last year, and about a quarter of residents are living in poverty, according to research produced by Columbia University and Robin Hood, an anti-poverty philanthropy.\n\nHouseholds across the city need to make at least $100,000 to afford basic necessities, according to a separate study, well above the income cutoff for food stamp benefits, reduced-price transit cards and some housing vouchers for families of four.\n\n“In a city where the cost of living is so high, the housing costs are so high, people even up the income distribution feel pretty squeezed,” said Christopher Wimer, who runs the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia.\n\nMany residents who are deciding whether they can afford to put down roots in New York are also grappling with the complicated equation of what they can expect from a city that demands some of the highest taxes in the country.\n\nIf Mr. Mamdani wins, as polls indicate he is likely to, his tenure will represent a major test of whether universal access to social programs can make a real dent in the high cost of living — without leaving government budgets in the red.\n\nMr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman from Queens, won a surprise victory over Mr. Cuomo after running a campaign focused on affordability, which launched him from a little-known activist legislator to one of the nation’s most prominent Democrats.\n\nHe has promised to freeze the rent on the city’s roughly one million rent-stabilized apartments, make buses free, open five city-owned grocery stores and create a free, universal child care system. He recently posted an “affordability calculator” on his website, encouraging voters to see how much they would save if those policies were enacted.\n\nWhile Mr. Mamdani’s platform has proved popular with voters, some budget experts have raised concerns about its cost, which a recent New York Times analysis found could swell to nearly $7 billion.\n\nMr. Cuomo’s proposals would be less expensive, but still costly: His campaign has estimated that his plan to lower grocery prices would cost about $250 million, that his proposal to cut income taxes for some low-income families would cost $300 million a year, that his transportation plan would cost $140 million annually and that his child care proposal would cost $112 million a year.\n\nThe two candidates’ contrasting plans for making public transportation more accessible offer a case study for how differently they would govern.\n\nMr. Cuomo has said he would make subways and buses free for New Yorkers making up to 150 percent of the federal poverty line, about $48,000 for a family of four. The idea is modeled in part on the existing Fair Fares program, which offers transit cards for half the regular price to low-income New Yorkers; the income cutoff for that program is $46,000 for a family of four. Mr. Cuomo would promote the initiative to boost enrollment, his campaign said.\n\n“Besides playing socialist, why should New Yorkers subsidize the bus fare for rich people?” Mr. Cuomo said during a news conference this summer. “Why? Why should they pay my bus fare?”\n\nMr. Mamdani has said that Fair Fares is emblematic of what doesn’t work about so-called means-tested programs, which require people to submit proof that their incomes fall beneath a certain level in order to qualify.\n\nOnly about a third of New Yorkers who are eligible for the benefit actually use it, according to a 2024 report, even as 20 percent of New Yorkers surveyed at the time said they were struggling to cover their transportation costs.\n\nMr. Mamdani has contrasted Fair Fares to a pilot he championed to create a free bus route in each borough. Most of the riders on those routes were making $28,000 a year or less, he said in an interview earlier this year with the New York Editorial Board, a group of local journalists, but only 14 percent of those riders were enrolled in the program.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s campaign has said that it could implement the free bus program, which could cost up to $800 million, without approval from the state or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that operates the city’s subways and buses.\n\n“If you ask working-class New Yorkers, many of whom have been failed by a bureaucracy, to jump through many more hoops to get relief from that bureaucracy, you will lose about half, or in this case even more than 80 percent of your target population,” Mr. Mamdani said.\n\nWhile the idea of free buses for all has found support from some transit advocates, others have raised concerns.\n\n“The broad agreement for a long time has been that, yes, you should pay a fare, but the fare should be heavily subsidized,” said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. “If you are going to break that contract, that has a lot of implications that you have to consider,” like the potential for homeless people to ride the bus all day or for riders to get confused and think that the subways are free, too.\n\nThe debate over which New Yorkers should benefit from government programs has played out in starkly personal terms when it comes to affordable housing.\n\nMr. Mamdani lives in Astoria, Queens, in a rent-stabilized apartment. While such units are available to anyone who applies for them, Mr. Cuomo accused the assemblyman, who makes $142,000 a year, of “callous theft” and said Mr. Mamdani was effectively keeping the apartment from a needier New Yorker.\n\nThe former governor has proposed a new law that would allow those apartments to be rented only to people who pay 30 percent or more of their income in rent. He called the plan “Zohran’s Law,” and it was met with skepticism even from housing experts who have expressed concern that Mr. Mamdani’s rent freeze would make it harder for landlords to pay for the upkeep of rent-stabilized units. (The freeze does not pose a direct cost to the city.)\n\nMr. Mamdani responded with a joke at Mr. Cuomo’s expense: “I live rent free in his head.”\n\nThe two candidates agree that the city’s existing free child care program should be expanded. Mr. Cuomo wants to guarantee seats for all 3-year-olds under a so-called 3K program that is currently available to many but not all toddlers.\n\nHe has not made the argument that only low-income New Yorkers should be able to send their children to free child care programs, and has said he supports universal child care as an “aspirational goal,” but that funding it would limit spending for too many other priorities.\n\nMr. Mamdani wants to go much further, creating a free system for children as young as 6 weeks old, which would include a 3K expansion.\n\nHe has said he would raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers to fund the program, which would cost about $6 billion, but has signaled a willingness to consider other funding sources, since Gov. Kathy Hochul has said she is not willing to raise taxes.\n\nEach child care plan show the opportunities and limits of the candidates’ different approaches to affordability.\n\nMr. Cuomo has argued that voters are being duped by Mr. Mamdani’s sweeping plans, which the former governor has mocked as utopian: “Everything free. Everything. Free transportation, free food, free clothes, free education. Who pays?” he said at a rally shortly before the June primary.\n\nMost experts agree that expanding the existing child care system for 3-year-olds, which is widely but not universally available, is imminently doable.\n\nBut many advocates, along with Ms. Hochul and a significant share of voters, believe that New York should go much further.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s universal child care would involve a massive effort to hire new teachers, create new spaces and turn some existing private programs public.\n\nA potential Mamdani administration might have to expand child care to younger children in bits and pieces, perhaps picking a few low-income neighborhoods to test out programs before making them universal.\n\nInitially offering services to the most vulnerable residents, or thinking creatively about how to expand access to programs without making them completely universal, is an unavoidable part of the messy work of governing, said Robert Greenstein, a researcher at the Brookings Institution who studies the social safety net.\n\n“Sometimes the debate gets too oversimplified,” Mr. Greenstein said.\n\nAdvocates argue that benefits should be only for the poor — or for everyone all the way to the top of the income scale. But there is a lot of room in the middle for politicians to make meaningful changes, as long as they consider fiscal and logistical barriers, Mr. Greenstein said.\n\n“You cannot escape these decisions.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/politics/virginia-democrats-redistrict.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:37:11-04:00","title":"Virginia Democrats Plan to Redraw House Maps in Redistricting Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Democrats are planning to redraw congressional maps mid-decade in a direct response to President Trump’s influence on Republican-led redistricting efforts across several states.

Push\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T11:37:11-04:00\n\nThe next front in the nation’s pitched battle over mid-decade congressional redistricting is opening in Virginia, where Democrats are planning the first step toward redrawing congressional maps, a move that could give their party two or three more seats.\n\nThe surprise development, which is set to be announced by legislators on Thursday, would make Virginia the second state, after California, in which Democrats try to counter a wave of Republican moves demanded by President Trump to redistrict states to their advantage before the 2026 midterm elections. No other Democratic state has begun redistricting proceedings, while several Republican states have drawn new maps or are deliberating doing so.\n\nDemocrats now hold six of Virginia’s 11 congressional seats. Redistricting could deliver two or three additional seats for the party, depending on how aggressive cartographers choose to be in a redrawing effort.\n\n“We are coming back to address actions by the Trump administration,” said Scott Surovell, the majority leader of the Virginia Senate, who confirmed the plans.\n\nThe Virginia Democrats’ moves are the latest in a monthslong tango that has resulted in Texas and Missouri enacting new maps that add more Republican seats, California asking voters to approve a new map to add Democratic seats and North Carolina Republican lawmakers on Tuesday approving a new map expected to transfer one congressional seat to Republicans from Democrats.\n\nMr. Trump has pressured Republican legislators in Indiana to enact a new map to eliminate the state’s two Democratic-held House seats, and Democrats expect Florida Republicans will attempt to redraw their state’s congressional districts in early 2026. Republicans in Kansas and Nebraska have also explored redistricting ahead of the midterms, though neither have yet taken formal steps to do so.\n\nWith congressional Republicans and a friendly Supreme Court acceding to nearly all of Mr. Trump’s demands, Democrats have viewed the midterm elections as their lone opportunity to reclaim some power in the federal government. Republicans now hold a five-seat majority in the House, which is seen as far more likely to change hands than the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 advantage and a favorable 2026 map.\n\nVirginia is one of few options Democrats have to boost their chances of engineering more House seats for themselves next year.\n\nDemocrats control all facets of government in far fewer states than do Republicans, and many of those Democratic states — like Colorado, New York, Oregon and Washington State — have implemented redistricting reforms to prevent political gerrymandering.\n\nIn Illinois and Maryland, Democratic states where redistricting is logistically easier, the governors have been noncommittal.\n\nGov. Wes Moore of Maryland has said “all options are on the table.” Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois on Tuesday said he is philosophically opposed to mid-decade redistricting but added: “I’m not going to sit back and let” Republican states create what he described as an unfair advantage.\n\nJohn Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistributing Committee, predicted that redistricting activity would continue across the country. “The farther Donald Trump drags our country into a gerrymandering crisis, the more states will look for responsive options to protect the voting power of the American people,” he said.\n\nFormer Representative Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for Virginia governor, has not been involved in planning the redistricting effort. She said in August that she had “no plans” to commence a redistricting effort, though the state’s rules do not require the governor’s participation in the constitutional amendment process. Ms. Spanberger, through an aide, declined to comment.\n\nAdam Kincaid, the executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, said that, “This seems like a pretty desperate move from Democrats to change the conversation a week before the election.”\n\nAs in California, redrawing Virginia’s congressional districts mid-decade requires altering the state’s constitution. To do that, majorities in consecutive sessions of the legislature — once this year and again after Jan. 15 when newly-elected delegates are seated — must approve the amendment. Then, it would have to pass a statewide referendum, which could go before voters early next year.\n\nDemocrats hold 51 out of 100 seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates and have a 21-19 advantage in the State Senate. Virginia state senators do not face re-election until 2027.\n\nAll 100 seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates are up for election Nov. 4, and Democrats are expected to increase their margin. Democratic House candidates are collectively spending over six times more than their Republican counterparts on television advertising in the campaign’s final weeks, according to an analysis by AdImpact, a media tracking firm.\n\nThe redistricting discussion is likely to inject uncertainty into Virginia’s politics 12 days before an election that, in recent weeks, has been dominated by discussion of a texting scandal that has engulfed Democrats’ nominee for attorney general. Public and private polling indicates Ms. Spanberger has a wide lead over her Republican counterpart, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, though the contests for attorney general and lieutenant governor are believed to be tighter.\n\nUnder the existing map, Virginia was expected to have three competitive congressional races. Representatives Rob Wittman and Jen Kiggans, both Republicans, and Eugene Vindman, a Democrat, each face the prospect of well-funded challengers. No prospective maps have been drawn yet, two of the people involved in the plans said, and it is not clear which Republican seats would be targeted.\n\n“I’m proud that Democrats in Virginia are leading the charge to fight back against Trump’s attempts to rig the midterms and are keeping their options open to ensure we have fair elections next year,” Mr. Vindman said.\n\nThe Virginia redistricting process is set to begin Thursday afternoon when Democratic leaders in the General Assembly convene legislators for a session to begin Monday.\n\nDemocrats can convene lawmakers to address the congressional maps now on an administrative technicality: Gov. Glenn Youngkin called a special session in May 2024, which Democratic legislators left open. That left the authority to reconvene the chambers to the speaker of the House of Delegates and the chair of the State Senate’s Rules committee.\n\nAn aide to Mr. Youngkin declined to comment. Ms. Earle-Sears’s spokeswoman, Brittany McGivern, said the Democratic redistricting effort is evidence that Ms. Spanberger cannot be trusted.\n\n“Abigail Spanberger is on record saying she wouldn’t take up redistricting, yet her party — which she leads — is doing just that,” Ms. McGivern said.\n\nThe House speaker, Don Scott, declined to comment.\n\nThe Senate’s rules committee chairwoman, Mamie Locke, did not respond to messages.\n\nVirginia voters, by a nearly two-to-one margin, approved an amendment to the state constitution in 2020 that created an independent redistricting commission.\n\nMany of the same state legislators who voted to put the amendment before voters in 2020 are now expected to ask Virginia voters to suspend it next year.\n\nNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/climate/coral-bleaching-florida-staghorn-elkorn.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:00:19-04:00","title":"Heat Has Essentially Wiped Out 2 Key Coral Species on Florida Reefs","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major scientific study published in Science in 2025 reveals that elkhorn and staghorn coral, two of the most important reef-building species in Florida, are now functionally extinct across most of the state’s reefs due to a record-breaking marine heat wave in 2023.

ocean heat wave in 2023, two of the most historically important coral species in Florida are functionally extinct from the state’s reef, scientists have found.\n\nElkhorn and staghorn coral, known for their branching limestone arms that create incomparable reef habitat, have all but vanished everywhere except the northernmost sections of the reef, according to research published Thursday in the journal Science. Those that remain are so diminished that they are not able to contribute to the ecosystem in a meaningful way, the authors said.\n\nThe findings are a bracing example of the toll that climate change is wreaking on the world’s coral reefs, which support an estimated quarter of marine species, including fish that provide crucial protein and income in coastal communities. Reefs also protect coasts from storms, and elkhorn coral’s tall branches are especially important in breaking the energy of waves.\n\n“Scientists have been warning of this for quite literally decades,” said Andrew Baker, a professor of marine biology at the University of Miami and one of the authors of the study. “The surprise is that it happened so fast. And it wasn’t more deaths by a thousand cuts. It was a sudden, final kind of guillotine.”\n\nThat guillotine was a record-breaking marine heat wave that hit Florida in 2023. At the time, conservationists raced to pull corals out of the water and house them in tanks in a desperate effort to save some genetic diversity.\n\nIt was the ninth known mass bleaching to hit Florida’s coral reef; the first occurred in 1987. When corals are stressed, they lose the algae they rely on for survival and will die unless conditions improve quickly. In 2023, corals there experienced heat stress that was two to four times greater than any year on record. Temperatures were so high that some died even before bleaching, their tissue sloughing off.\n\nOne of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, coral reefs are sometimes called rainforests of the sea. But they are sensitive to changes in temperature and have limited ability to migrate. As humans raise the planet’s temperature by burning fossil fuels and destroying forests, the world’s oceans have absorbed some 90 percent of the additional heat.\n\nElkhorn and staghorn coral, which are native to southern Florida, Mexico and the Caribbean, were already classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. Since the 1980s, they have been devasted by marine heat and disease, along with other stressors like pollution and overfishing.\n\nOn Florida’s coral reef, the incidence of elkhorn and staghorn had declined by 90 percent or more before 2023, said Ross Cunning, a coral biologist at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago and one of the study’s lead authors.\n\nBut the corals could still be found throughout the reef, bolstered by the work of restoration groups that grew and planted them.\n\nHowever, in the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas, the 2023 heat wave killed off 98 to 100 percent of the elkhorn and staghorn that remained, the study found. Farther north, off southeast Florida, the water temperatures were not as high and the corals fared better; 38 percent of elkhorn and staghorn died.\n\n“The loss of the staghorn and elkhorn is so significant because those species have been the dominant reef builders on Florida’s reefs for the last 10,000 years,” Dr. Cunning said. “They have the fastest growth rates of Caribbean corals and therefore they grow and build three-dimensional structure more rapidly.”\n\nOther kinds of coral, like brain and boulder coral, are still prevalent in Florida’s reef, and the researchers are currently analyzing the heat wave’s effect on those species. Early results appear to indicate that, while up to 90 percent of them bleached severely in 2023, they seem to have recovered relatively well, Dr. Cunning said.\n\nBecause those species build limestone mounds as opposed to branches, he compared Florida’s reef to a forest that has lost its tall trees.\n\nThe study published on Thursday had 47 authors and was based on diver surveys at more than 52,000 colonies of staghorn and elkhorn coral across 391 sites.\n\nDr. Cunning described what he saw on a diving expedition in September 2023 as “carnage.”\n\n“We all kind of went into shock a little bit, just to cope with what we were seeing,” he said.\n\nLarge thickets of staghorn coral, healthy just three months earlier on a previous trip, were dead or dying. All the team could do, he said, was take pictures and collect data so that others would know what was happening.\n\nMark Hixon, a professor of marine biology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who was not involved with the research, said that the study was by well-respected coral scientists and “forthrightly” reported the functional extinction of elkhorn and staghorn corals in Florida.\n\n“Unfortunately for all of us, this disaster was expected after ocean temperatures surged in 2023, yet another tragic example of nations failing to address climate disruption,” Dr. Hixon said. “I personally witnessed the death of my favorite coral reef in the Bahamas during the first global coral bleaching event back in 1998. It was weird shedding tears into my face mask.”\n\nThe planet is currently in its fourth global bleaching event, which is the most widespread on record.\n\nThis month, a group of 160 scientists asserted that extensive coral reef die-offs meant that the planet had crossed its first climate-related tipping point, “threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people.”\n\nScientists expect some coral species to fare better than others.\n\nCoral restoration groups continue to grow and transplant elkhorn and staghorn to Florida’s reef, and efforts are underway to help the species withstand higher temperatures.\n\nFor example, scientists have crossed Florida elkhorn with a variety from Honduras that thrives in higher temperatures. In July, for the first time, these hybrid “Flonduran corals” were affixed onto the Florida reef. It’s early days, and scaling such efforts would require tremendous resources. So far, despite more high ocean temperatures this summer, they look healthy.\n\nBut even if such interventions succeed, they alone will not be enough to save reefs, scientists emphasized.\n\n“If we don’t stop runaway climate change, no amount of intervention and restoration is going to work,” Dr. Cunning said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/dining/shelly-fireman-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:51:34-04:00","title":"Shelly Fireman, a Showman Restaurateur for Showgoers, Dies at 93","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shelly Fireman, a pioneering New York restaurateur born in the Bronx in 1931, died at 93 in Manhattan after a stroke.

the most successful contemporary New York restaurateur at popularizing Italian cooking for broad American tastes — and broad American waistlines — died on Oct. 9 in Manhattan. He was 93.\n\nThe cause of his death, in a hospital, was a stroke, said Ben Grossman, chief executive of the Fireman Hospitality Group, Mr. Fireman’s company, which owns eight restaurants in New York and two outside Washington.\n\nIn an era of celebrity chefs, a Shelly Fireman restaurant was never about who was in the kitchen; it was about Mr. Fireman, an entrepreneur whose string of canteens in high-traffic Manhattan neighborhoods — among them Cafe Fiorello, across from Lincoln Center, and Bond 45, in the theater district — boast theatrical décor and flamboyantly styled food.\n\nCafe Fiorello, which opened on Broadway in 1974, popularized housemade ravioli, fried artichokes and artisan-style pizzas that New York magazine once named the best in the city. It is still in business.\n\nThe Bronx-born Mr. Fireman, who lived above the house at Cafe Fiorello, also had a home in Tuscany, in the town of Camaiore, where he spent summers for more than 30 years and sought ideas for his restaurants. (He always returned from Italy to New York in September to observe the Jewish holidays. “He emotionally felt he was Italian,” Mr. Grossman said.)\n\nOne Italian inspiration came from a visit to Capri: an antipasto bar situated outside the kitchen on the dining floor. The antipasto bar became a signature of Mr. Fireman’s.\n\nThe first antipasto bar — eggplant parmigiana, broccoli rabe and a cornucopia of other dishes — was installed at Trattoria dell’Arte, near Carnegie Hall, which opened in 1988. That restaurant is also known for the giant sculptures of noses and lips on its walls, created by the designer Milton Glaser.\n\nA sculptor in his spare time, Mr. Fireman liked to plant his restaurants near cultural hubs. He did not see them as foodie destinations. He emphasized eye-popping portions in showy settings, intended to hook people on their way to or from a concert or a Broadway production.\n\nIn a city where buzzed-about restaurants can open and close within a few seasons, Mr. Fireman’s endeavors have kept turning over tables for decades.\n\nWhen the 250-seat Bond 45 opened in 2005 on the former site of a clothing store, Frank Bruni, then a food critic for The New York Times, wrote, “When an Italian restaurant as big, blunt and built for the masses as Bond 45 comes along, it’s all too easy for food cognoscenti to cop an attitude, sneer a little and head instead for cozier, frumpier gems in neighborhoods less trafficked by tourists than the area around Times Square is.”\n\n“But Bond 45,” Mr. Bruni continued, “has a kind of emphatic charm — an ebullience — that more self-conscious places don’t.”\n\nAnother Fireman property, the Redeye Grill on West 57th Street, which opened in 1996 and is still going, features a pair of six-foot-tall revolving bronze shrimp. A signature dish, dancing shrimp, consists of a dozen coconut-battered shrimp trembling on skewers jabbed into a pineapple.\n\n“Mr. Fireman knows exactly what people want: almost everything,” Ruth Reichl wrote in a Times review in 1997 that awarded Redeye Grill one star.\n\nMr. Fireman’s decision to situate two large establishments on West 57th Street with “Brooklyn” in their names — Brooklyn Diner and USA Brooklyn Delicatessen — did not derive from a love of sauerkraut-smothered hot dogs and strawberry cheesecake.\n\nHe named them, he said, because he “knew Brooklyn would sell.”\n\nNot all of Mr. Fireman’s ventures lasted. Fiorella, which opened in 1983 on the Upper East Side, was rated “fair” by the Times critic Mimi Sheraton. She described the restaurant as “lively” but the food as “exhausted.” After a reinvention as a fish restaurant — and, in 1999, a change of name to Fireman’s of Brooklyn — it eventually closed.\n\nFlorian, a rare venture downtown for Mr. Fireman, opened on Park Avenue South at East 19th Street in 2014 and closed three years later.\n\n“Every trend has its opposites, the ying to their yang,” Mr. Fireman told Forbes magazine in 2018. “For example, greasy hamburger places are growing, and yet healthy food places are growing too. So we try to ying it and yang it every day, and not just jump at every new trend.\n\n“Exactly what we don’t want to be is too trendy,” he added. “I want to not be trendy.”\n\nSheldon Martin Fireman was born in the Bronx on Nov. 22, 1931, the elder of two children of Frances (Moses) and Samuel Fireman. His father worked in the garment district.\n\nShelly graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and attended Hartwick College in upstate New York, but did not graduate.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Marilyn Fireman, whom he married in 1970, and their son, John.\n\nMr. Fireman was hanging around Greenwich Village in the early 1960s when he hit on the idea of opening a bagel shop to serve the hipsters on MacDougal Street. He spent three months at the New York Public Library reading about the restaurant business, then opened the Hip Bagel. It became popular with jazz musicians and artists.\n\nAfter a few years, he joined a restaurant group and opened a steak place, the Tin Lizzie, on West 51st Street, which the artist Peter Max helped design.\n\nHe remained active into his 90s. He opened Paris Bar, a brasserie, and Le Jardin, a rooftop bar, both in the Meridien Hotel on West 57th Street, in 2024. Forbes asked him in 2018 why he continued to conceive new projects.\n\n“It’s like having one object of art and staring at it,” he answered. “After a while it gets boring. Otherwise, what do I do? Watch a soap opera?”\n\n"}]}
