It’s a new, troubling tendency for Atlantic storms \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Tropical Storm Melissa  is expected to meander the Caribbean at an agonizingly slow pace in the coming days, even as it’s forecast to strengthen into a hurricane, covering as little as 2 miles in an hour. This is slower than an average person’s walking speed.\n \n\n   \n  Hurricanes are powerful storms, but they require a tug or pull from other weather systems, such as a cold front or a dip in the jet stream, to determine how fast they move and where they go.\n \n\n   \n  When those influences are very weak or absent, however — as is the case with Melissa — a storm can meander for days, dumping torrential amounts of rainfall on anyone unlucky enough to be nearby.\n \n\n   \n  Slow movement and weak upper-level winds can also help a storm like Melissa intensify into a major hurricane — Category 3 or stronger. Right now, the Caribbean Sea has some of the most unusually hot waters of any part of the Atlantic Ocean, and the storm could have the opportunity to tap into that energy.\n \n\n   \n  “The potential intensity is quite elevated in the Caribbean, compared to the 1979-2023 average for this time of year,” said Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist specializing in tropical cyclones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There has not been much storm activity in the Caribbean so far this year due to strong upper-level winds that have inhibited nascent storms from intensifying, he pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  But now, conditions are expected to be primed for Tropical Storm Melissa to keep at its snail’s pace.\n \n\n   \n    Are hurricanes slowing down?\n \n\n   \n  There is evidence that slow-moving tropical storms and hurricanes are occurring more frequently in the Atlantic Basin, particularly near and over land masses, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  Studies in the past several years have showed a slow-down in forward speed at landfall. That’s a critical change, since a slower-moving storm typically means more flooding rainfall, and potentially more storm surge.\n \n\n   \n  Some research has pointed to global warming as a potential cause of this trend, but this is not yet fully established, said meteorologist Kieran Bhatia of the global risk and reinsurance company Guy Carpenter.\n \n\n   \n  Some studies, Bhatia said, show tropical storms and hurricanes have slowed down in recent years over the continental United States and near-coastal US   regions as well.\n \n\n   \n  However, “these observed changes have not yet been confidently linked” to human-caused climate change, he said. The most recent major report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found a trend that is not explainable solely by natural variability with “medium” confidence, Bhatia said.\n \n\n   \n  Research from hurricane expert James Kossin and his colleagues have in fact pointed to  global slowdowns in tropical cyclone forward speeds . They found this trend was related to changes in upper-level air circulation that are consistent with expectations from global warming.\n \n\n   \n  Other work from Kossin, a former scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who teaches at the University of Wisconsin, stands out for showing a trend toward slower-moving or even stalling North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes  at or near landfall .\n \n\n   \n   Additional research by other scientists  provides further evidence of recent slowdowns in the forward movement of tropical cyclones, while some  modeling studies project  that future climate change is likely to result in more meandering storms.\n \n\n   \n  But the broader community of meteorologists and climate scientists are not yet fully in agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of any climate change ties, any tendency to slow down, like the crawling forward speed of Tropical Storm Melissa, has huge implications for impacts because it allows such storms to dump heavier rainfall totals over land.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa, for example, poses a major flooding threat to Jamaica and Hispaniola in particular, due to its extended proximity to land, the presence of tall mountains that tend to wring out moisture from the atmosphere and the likelihood that heavy rains will fall for many consecutive days.\n \n\n   \n  While the tie between slower-moving storms and climate change is a topic of active research, studies have conclusively shown tropical storms and hurricanes now produce more rainfall than they used to. This is due to warming ocean and air temperatures, since warmer air holds more moisture.\n \n\n   \n  A devastating example of a slow-moving, water-laden storm was Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which produced 60.58 inches of rain in southeastern Texas. This was the highest rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in US history.\n \n\n   \n  As storms slow down, there is potential for more hurricanes to be like Harvey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/king-charles-state-visit-vatican-pope-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:13:00-04:00","title":"King Charles Prays with Pope Leo at the Vatican as Prince Andrew Scandal Looms Back Home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III made history as the first British monarch to pray publicly with a pope in over 500 years during a state visit to the Vatican, marking a significant step in reconciling religious and political divides between the Church of England and the Catholic Church since the Reformation.

It was presided over by Leo and the Church of England’s Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell.\n \n\n   \n  The sight of the first joint prayer shared by the King and Pope signals the deepening of bonds between Catholics and Anglicans – a theme of the whistlestop visit.\n \n\n   \n  The King and Queen met the new pontiff for the first time since his May election on Thursday morning, following their arrival in Rome the previous evening to celebrate the holy Jubilee year, which takes place every quarter of a century.\n \n\n   \n  The couple landed at Ciampino airport and were greeted by a delegation including the UK’s Ambassador to the Holy See.\n \n\n   \n  The trip is being seen by both sides as a “significant moment” in reconciling divisions between the British monarchy and the papacy that go back to 1534, when Henry VIII broke with Rome and created the Church of England.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be difficult to overstate the significance of this particular visit,” Rev. Martin Browne, a Vatican official who works at the department for “Promoting Christian Unity,” told CNN. He said it was the first time that a royal visit had an “ecumenical dimension,” meaning that it was focused on building unity between Rome, the Church of England and wider Anglican communion.\n \n\n   \n  “A service in which both the pope and a British sovereign participate has not been experienced since long before the Reformation,” Browne explained. “Its uniqueness is underlined by the fact that it is taking place in the Sistine Chapel, inside the Apostolic Palace, with the music being led by the pope’s ‘own’ choir and two of the King’s ‘own’ choirs.”\n \n\n   \n  Later, the King and Queen will take part in an ecumenical service at the Basilica of St. Paul’s Outside the Walls, which has historic ties to the English Crown and is home to the tomb of the apostle St. Paul, for which past British monarchs paid the upkeep. It is one of the four papal basilicas in Rome and also houses a community of Benedictine monks.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo has approved making King Charles a “Royal Confrater” of St. Paul’s, as a “gesture of hospitality and spiritual fellowship.” In celebration of this new bond, a special throne-like chair has been commissioned by the place of worship, featuring the King’s coat of arms and the Latin motto “Ut unum sint” (“That they may be one”). It will remain permanently in the basilica for use by his successors.\n \n\n   \n  The pope is also making the King and Queen a knight and dame of the order of Pius IX. Charles has himself decided to honor Pope Leo by making him a “Papal Confrater of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle” and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, an honor traditionally given to heads of state.\n \n\n   \n  The state visit concludes with King Charles attending a reception at the Pontifical Beda College, a seminary which trains priests from across the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, Queen Camilla will meet six Catholic sisters from the International Union of Superiors General, who work to support female empowerment around the world, including through girls’ education.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the turbulence of the past, relations between the Vatican and the British monarchy are today marked by warmth and mutual respect. The UK and the Holy See have had full diplomatic relations since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Charles and Camilla were supposed to pay a state visit to the Vatican in early April, but the trip was postponed over Pope Francis’ poor health. They continued with an official visit to Italy, visiting Rome and Ravenna in the northeast. But the royal couple were able to privately visit the ailing pontiff a fortnight before he died.\n \n\n   \n  As Prince of Wales, Charles visited Vatican City on five occasions, while his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, met five popes during her lifetime.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, there are differences and divisions, some of them very deep,” Browne said. “But this (visit) is a reminder for everyone that what unites is more significant.”\n \n\n   \n  Diarmaid MacCulloch, a church historian from the University of Oxford, said that while there had been some ill-informed “hype” around the King’s visit, “there is some genuine significance in the Papacy showing such formal favor” to Charles.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a nice goodwill gesture on the Vatican’s part, and goodwill gestures are always welcome,” MacCulloch said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/federal-worker-pay-bill-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"GOP attempts to squeeze Democrats with vote to pay ‘essential workers,’ including troops and TSA agents","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senate Republican leaders are attempting to pressure Democrats to end a prolonged government shutdown by proposing a bill that would pay 'essential workers' such as military personnel, border patrol agents, and TSA agents from the Treasury during the funding gap.

Ferris, Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senate GOP leaders are again shaking up their strategy as they look for more ways to pressure Democrats to end a three-week stalemate over government funding — this time, with a vote that would keep paychecks flowing to “essential” workers.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, however, are expected to widely reject the measure, leaving Congress no closer to resolving what is now the second longest government shutdown in history.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate will vote Thursday on a bill that would require the government to pay workers deemed essential and required to work during the lapse — including those in the US military, border patrol and Transportation Security Administration — from the Treasury Department’s coffers during a shutdown. That vote comes a day before millions of federal workers miss their first full paycheck, and is intended to cause maximum political pain for Democrats on day 23 of the political standoff.\n \n\n   \n  But Democrats say they oppose any bill that does not pay all federal workers and will instead propose a countermeasure on Thursday that would ensure furloughed workers, too, would be paid. It’s not clear that the measure will receive a vote, though even if it does, it would fail because it needs 60 votes to advance. The GOP’s measure, too, is likely to fall short of that 60-vote threshold.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t like the bill because it gives the president the ability to decide who’s essential and who’s not. And what we see is he is using this in a political and punitive way,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents a large contingent of federal workers living in Virginia. “‘We’re going to cancel Democratic programs. We’re going to send troops to Democratic cities.’ He would use this discretionary power to punish some and reward others.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to pay all federal workers,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN this week. Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey, a former civilian advisor at the State Department, said he also has “deep concerns” about the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “I used to be a civil servant. I care a lot about them, but you can’t just choose a few, and not everybody, especially if Trump is making the decision,” Kim said. “They all deserve paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have fiercely pushed back against the Democratic effort to also include furloughed federal workers, who are not currently receiving paychecks, but will get back pay after the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re open for paying all federal workers, then why don’t they just reopen the government?” GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin asked of Democrats this week, arguing that his colleagues could guarantee pay for all federal employees if they would vote for the GOP stopgap bill to fund the government through November 21.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, however, warned that finding a way to continue to pay federal workers amid the Capitol Hill impasse would take the “pressure” off of lawmakers to negotiate a way out.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN about Democrats’ desire for a bill to keep paychecks flowing to all federal workers, including those who have been furloughed, instead of making them wait to receive back pay, Tuberville responded, “Well, it’s called a shutdown. I mean, you start paying everybody then no pressure on anybody from either side.”\n \n\n   \n  Congress, he said, should leave the issue “as it is,” adding that military and law enforcement should be paid amid the shutdown, and “everybody else, shut it off.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he hadn’t had recent conversations with Democrats on their position on his bill, which he drafted along with Sen. Todd Young of Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll see what they’re going to do. I mean, they ought to just open up the government,” Johnson said. If they oppose it, he said, “hopefully voters will hold them accountable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/weather/tropical-storm-hurricane-melissa-caribbean-track","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:53:00-04:00","title":"Melissa’s Crawl Through the Caribbean Could Unleash Catastrophic Flooding and Destructive Winds","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, barely moving through the Caribbean, poses a significant threat due to its slow drift over record-hot ocean waters, which could fuel rapid intensification into a major hurricane.

unleash catastrophic flooding and destructive winds \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Briana Waxman\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:53 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa is barely moving through the Caribbean, and that’s exactly what makes it so dangerous. The longer it lingers, the more rain it dumps. Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic could face days of relentless downpours and landslides.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Melissa was about 240 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds near 50 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s drifting west at just 3 mph, slower than the average person on an afternoon stroll. The storm is stalled over water that’s record-hot – perfect fuel for a storm to explode in strength.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is forecast to reach hurricane strength by the weekend and could intensify rapidly into a  major hurricane  – Category 3 or greater – by early next week. If it does, it would be the fourth of the first five Atlantic hurricanes this season to reach Category 4 or stronger, something seen only three other times on record: 1932, 1999 and 2010, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher  Phil Klotzbach .\n \n\n   \n  The storm is already bringing heavy rain to parts of the Caribbean. Forecasters warn of up to 10 inches of rainfall, with isolated totals topping a foot across southern Haiti, southern Dominican Republic and eastern Jamaica through Saturday. The hurricane center says life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely in mountainous areas.\n \n\n   \n    Why Melissa’s setup is so alarming\n \n\n   \n    Two potential scenarios, both devastating\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track remains uncertain, but the range of possibilities is narrowing and no potential outcome looks good. The storm is trapped between competing weather systems that are locking it in place over the north-central Caribbean. That leaves Jamaica and Hispaniola squarely in the danger zone.\n \n\n   \n   Scenario 1: The long, slow drift west. If Melissa continues creeping west or west-northwest, it could linger south of Jamaica into early next week – right over some of the warmest water on Earth. That setup could supercharge the storm, potentially pushing it to Category 4 strength or higher by Monday. In that case, Jamaica and southern Haiti would face days of destructive winds, storm surge and torrential rain.\n \n\n   \n   Scenario 2: A faster pull north. If the jet stream tugs Melissa northward sooner, the storm could move toward Haiti or the Dominican Republic this weekend. That would cap its intensity a bit but put heavily populated, flood-prone regions directly in the crosshairs. Hispaniola’s terrain would wring out even more rain, heightening the risk of catastrophic flash floods and mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Either path brings days of flooding followed by potentially devastating winds and surge.\n \n\n   \n  The US mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct US hit looks unlikely. If Melissa takes longer to turn north, it could bend toward eastern Cuba or the Bahamas before curving into the Atlantic. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week – the calling card of the 2025 Atlantic Hurricane Season.\n \n\n   \n    A late-season storm supercharged by a hotter world\n \n\n   \n  Hurricanes usually lose steam by late October, when cooler water and stronger wind shear take over. Not this year. The Caribbean remains record-hot, with ocean warmth extending deep below the surface – enough to keep Melissa strengthening.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s anticipated explosion in strength from tapping into that energy is something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  It’s part of a broader pattern scientists have been warning about: as the planet warms, hurricanes are intensifying faster and dumping more rain, especially in the western Atlantic and Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s path and strength will keep evolving in the days ahead, but the warning signs are already there: a near-stationary storm over record heat, surrounded by mountains and millions of vulnerable people.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/cycling-emma-pooley-eating-disorders-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:31:00-04:00","title":"Former Cyclist Emma Pooley Speaks Out on 'Unscientific Bullying' Around Food in Cycling","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the widespread issue of disordered eating and eating disorders in elite cycling, particularly due to a culture that prioritizes being thin and under-fueled for performance.

‘unscientific bullying’ around food amid the sport’s high prevalence of eating disorders \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:31 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Emma Pooley may have retired from professional  cycling  around a decade ago, but she believes that the effects of under-fueling – what she describes as her “weird” relationship with food – are still with her.\n \n\n   \n  Those scars, Pooley says, are “permanent” and include having a bone density which is “10 to 20 years older than I actually am.”\n \n\n   \n  When it comes to eating, the British former cyclist has found her mindset to be complicated and often contradictory. Pooley has always loved food, recently publishing a  cookbook  with some of her best and favorite recipes; but she also recognizes how her cycling career made her develop worrying and unhealthy habits.\n \n\n   \n  “I sort of thought I shouldn’t eat as much, and it took a while to get through that and to realize that, actually, the more I ate, the faster I was,” Pooley tells CNN Sports. “And I didn’t put on weight because I was training lots.”\n \n\n   \n  For most of her racing career, Pooley says that she believed she was fat, restricting her diet and avoiding certain foods when her body was craving them the most. It’s an approach that was born out of seeing “really, really skinny people” around her in the peloton, as well as the false assumption that being lighter makes you a faster and better cyclist.\n \n\n   \n  The effects of under-eating for professional athletes, Pooley has discovered, can be dangerous and long-lasting.\n \n\n   \n  “With women, if you’re underweight for a long time, you end up messing your hormones around and (can develop) low bone density,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  “My bone density is lower than it should be, and I keep getting stress fractures. I run lots now – that’s my main sport and I still race competitively. In the last seven years, I’ve had a stress fracture in my femur and a stress fracture in my foot. I don’t know if they’re directly caused by years of under-fueling, but it certainly wouldn’t have helped.”\n \n\n   \n   Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport  (REDs) occurs when an athlete of any gender has overtrained and/or under-eaten for a prolonged period in an attempt to improve their performance, often without knowing the dangers of failing to compensate for the energy they expend in training and racing.\n \n\n   \n  Poor bone health is just one knock-on effect. Medical experts say that REDs can damage an athlete’s metabolism, their immune system, their cardiovascular health, their menstrual cycle, and their mental health, as well as their athletic performance.\n \n\n   \n  The condition isn’t limited to cycling, but under-eating has become a flashpoint in the sport in recent years. A  scoping review  published in December 2022 found that competitive cycling has “a high prevalence of disordered eating and/or eating disorders,” while several athletes have spoken openly about their troubled relationships with food.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview  with Cycling Weekly last year, Slovenian Jan Tratnik said that his desperation to lose weight led him to develop bulimia – binge-eating large amounts of food and purging it to avoid weight gain.\n \n\n   \n  “I couldn’t handle being starving, so I cracked and ate too much,” Tratnik said. “Being afraid to gain weight, it was a circle I couldn’t escape from.”\n \n\n   \n  Cédrine Kerbaol, a professional cyclist and nutritionist,  said  during this year’s Tour de France Femmes that the sport is at a “dangerous time” when it comes to thinness and weight loss.\n \n\n   \n  “These recent years, it has been very fashionable to count every gram on our plates,” she told French newspaper L’Humanité. “We must not fall into a form of dehumanization and infantilization.”\n \n\n   \n  Former Tour de France champion and five-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins, meanwhile,  said  in 2019 that “the focus on being light as a rider … can lead to depression, it can lead to things worse than that.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a combination of factors which make elite cyclists more susceptible to eating disorders and disordered eating, including riders not wanting to show weakness and facing pressure from coaches and team managers.\n \n\n   \n  Pooley, who was crowned world time trial champion in 2010 and won an Olympic silver medal in 2008, has first-hand exposure to what she calls “unscientific kind of bullying” around food from team officials.\n \n\n   \n  She points to one instance when, after winning a race in Montreal, she was reprimanded for ordering a hot chocolate.\n \n\n   \n  “What I did experience was teams with directors who watched what you ate,” says Pooley. “So with no kind of measure and no science behind it, they just kind of watched you balefully and got cross with you if you ate the wrong thing.\n \n\n   \n  “Back when I was racing, certainly from some team directors, they seem to think that enjoying food was in some way wrong because food is just a tool,” she adds. “It’s just fuel, and you shouldn’t enjoy it. If you enjoy food, you’ll get fat. And that is so wrong. I really think that enjoying food is an important part of a healthy diet.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Jack Hardwicke, a social scientist at Nottingham Trent University in England, the notion that cycling is a “weight-sensitive sport” is “very engrained from the elite level down,” often triggering patterns of unhealthy behaviors in riders.\n \n\n   \n  That is even filtered through the language used by those in management positions.\n \n\n   \n  “Coaches have a responsibility that when they’re coaching, what are they focusing on?” Hardwicke tells CNN Sports. “How are they talking about weight? How are they talking about body image? How are they helping athletes develop a healthy relationship between their sport, their health and performance, and what’s the balance?”\n \n\n   \n  In elite cycling, Hardwicke adds, “team managers might not see their athletes as humans all the time – they see them as people that they need to perform for the team to survive.”\n \n\n   \n  For riders, the toll of under-eating is not just on their bodies, but also on their mental wellbeing.\n \n\n   \n  “When you speak to people that have suffered with eating disorders and disordered eating, the mental battle is really the biggest part,” says Hardwicke. “It’s very closely aligned with things like body image issues, self-confidence issues … I think that’s where the real issue is.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN Sports, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling’s global governing body, referred to a previous  statement  on REDs syndrome, which said: “The UCI’s role is to raise awareness of the health risks associated with uncontrolled weight loss, and to support doctors with resources to facilitate their work in clinical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “For this, the UCI is in the process of finalising documentation and tools that can be used by team doctors to enable the diagnosis of REDs. The strategy is to rely on a screening and risk-assessment tool validated and published by an International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus group.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Pooley, she admits that cycling has “changed a lot” since she initially retired in 2014, with the most successful teams “encouraging riders to eat better and eat more.”\n \n\n   \n  Today, she firmly believes that food and sport form a natural partnership – “the more you train, the more you have to eat,” adds Pooley – and has made strong, mental connections between moments in her cycling career and things she ate at the time.\n \n\n   \n  That affiliation is partly why the 43-year-old decided to publish “Oat to Joy,” which is part recipe book inspired by the humbleness and versatility of oats, part autobiography chronicling food-based memories from her cycling career.\n \n\n   \n  “I can exactly remember the pizza at the end of the Giro (d’Italia) in 2011 after I didn’t win,” says Pooley. “Certainly, with races, I can remember the special food that we had the dinner after. I’m just really good at remembering what I ate.”\n \n\n   \n  Her competitive cycling days behind her, Pooley has now returned to her first love: running. She competes in trail events, twice finishing 11th in world championship races, and usually only cycles for fun.\n \n\n   \n  And whenever she is tempted to head out on her bike, Pooley will always be sure to make “even more cafe stops than before” – a luxury her professional career didn’t always afford.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/tech/google-diversity-programs-women-techmakers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"‘Their history is just erased’: Google drops a key program for boosting women in tech","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Google has ended its direct support and integration of the Women Techmakers program, a global initiative launched in 2012 to support women in technology through community, training, and funding.

history is just erased’: Google drops a key program for boosting women in tech \n       \n  By Hadas Gold, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The email that said the career resource program for women would no longer be part of Google was terse and followed months of eroding support. But the deletion of years of Women Techmakers’ work came as a significant shock to its members.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything that I ever hosted and facilitated for Women Techmakers is gone. And there are just as many ambassadors who were in the community that put in so much effort to be part of this, (and) their history just erased,” Sherry Yang, a Google engineering manager in Canada, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Google earlier this month offloaded the key career resource program for supporting women in tech and severed its integration within the company. The decision was communicated to members in a short email with little explanation earlier this month. It left members feeling surprised, upset and sidelined as the company removed years’ worth of content and videos they created.\n \n\n   \n  The end of Women Techmakers served as another sign the search giant is unwinding its diversity programs as such initiatives face increasing political pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Google announced an external organization called Technovation will take over the group, but members of Women Techmakers told CNN they feel they have lost an important direct association and pipeline with one of the world’s most influential technology companies.\n \n\n   \n  “The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,” Vassiliki Dalakiari, a former Women Techmakers ambassador and AI research and development manager in Greece, told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.”\n \n\n   \n  Google declined to comment. A person with knowledge of the program said that Google is supporting and providing funding to Technovation through the transition phase and that the company believes in Technovation’s “ability to execute impactful, global programs.”\n \n\n   \n  Technovation CEO Tara Chklovski told CNN that the organization is getting funding from Google “to provide deeper programmatic support” to Women Techmaker members. The group will still have access to events, programs and “technology leaders from multinational companies from around the world (in addition to Google),” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the members say they feel tossed aside by Google after years of building a community many said helped them in their career and personally, as they forged their careers in a male-dominated industry.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Big fat silence’\n \n\n   \n  Women Techmakers  started at Google in 2012  to provide “visibility, community, and resources for women in technology” around the world through trainings, scholarships and event funding, regardless of whether they worked at Google. The most involved and experienced members could become ambassadors and even get funding to help them attend Google developer events.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Google  told employees  that it would no longer set diversity hiring targets and would evaluate its other diversity programs. The company said as a federal contractor, it needed to comply with President Donald Trump’s  executive order  on diversity, equity and inclusion programs for government agencies and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Women Techmakers who spoke to CNN said they started noticing a shift since then.\n \n\n   \n  One member of Women Techmakers based in Asia, who asked to only be identified as Tia, said it became increasingly difficult for ambassadors to get support for events and travel funding.\n \n\n   \n  Dalakiari told CNN that Women Techmakers Ambassadors did not receive the same level of support as they had in the past for the company’s Berlin developers conference over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no travel coverage, no invitation to the community events or meetups. It felt like we were included in name, but not in practice,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in early October, members received short emails, obtained by CNN, informing them that the program would end at Google and shift to Technovation, which started as a youth technology education organization 20 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Technovation says its mission is expanding to include adults and has vowed to maintain Women Techmakers’ mission and approach – as well as access to Google events and programs. But many women in tech said Google’s handling of the news signalled it wanted to quickly distance itself from diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “No global call. No formal announcement. No real explanation… just an email, and a big fat silence since then,” Leyla Damoisaux-Delnoy, a Brussels-based data scientist,  posted  on LinkedIn. “When a company’s commitment to equality ends with an email, it says a lot about what the commitment was really worth.”\n \n\n   \n  Several members CNN spoke to said they were shocked when Women Techmakers YouTube videos and LinkedIn posts were removed without warning. For some members like Yang, that meant vital proof of their work with the global internet juggernaut — like videos of events they led and panels they moderated — suddenly disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Tia said she and other members are feeling “something between devastation and rage.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a global women-in-tech program without informing or engaging its most active contributors sends a clear message and it’s disappointing,” Dalakiari said. “WTM made a real difference, and I’m not sure that decision reflects the values many of us signed up to represent.”\n \n\n   \n    Women in tech programs flailing\n \n\n   \n  Google’s decision to offload oversight of Women Techmakers is just the latest indication that tech giants are scaling back their diversity programs this year.\n \n\n   \n  Tech workers active in programs meant to support women in in the field told CNN they have seen a noticeable shift in funding and support in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who studies workplace inequality, said tech firms previously made investments to improve women’s representation after facing scrutiny from gender equality organizations, federal regulators and their own employees.\n \n\n   \n  But things changed in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “The pressure from the federal government is off, and now they actually fear that the Trump administration will come after them if they have any targeted programs,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Internally, more tech companies like Amazon and Meta are  culling their diversity programs .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Dell shut down its Dell Women’s Entrepreneur Network (DWEN). The company told CNN in a statement that the sunsetting of the women’s program coincided with shutting down their “Dell for Startups” program and is part of a “broader internal business strategy shift.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our commitment to empowering small businesses and entrepreneurs and fostering an inclusive workplace and ecosystem remains unwavering,” the company said in part.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Google’s Women Techmakers program told CNN they believe Technovation is a reputable organization with good intentions. But they’re concerned that it won’t have the same funding or impact as a company with the size, resources and recognition of Google.\n \n\n   \n  Still, company culture matters more than dedicated programs when it comes to supporting women and other groups, Tomaskovic-Devey said.\n \n\n   \n  “It probably does not matter much if targeted programs return. What matters is if Google, or any of the other big tech firms, actually manage their workplaces so that everyone feels respected and included,” Tomaskovic-Devey said. “Poor management will lead to backsliding where it really matters, in the diversity, productivity, and creativity of their workforces.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/melania-trump-east-wing-first-ladies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"Melania Trump has been silent on demolition of the East Wing, home to first ladies for decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump has remained silent on the demolition of the White House East Wing, a historic space that has served as the official workplace for first ladies since 1977.

Crews began work this week to build President Donald Trump’s long-sought ballroom — sparking outcry among some former East Wing staffers of both parties. Asked if the first lady is supportive of the project, her office would not say.\n \n\n   \n  Melania Trump has spent minimal time in the East Wing — which has long served as the entry point for grand White House events like state dinners and receptions — during her husband’s second term in office,  eschewing the nation’s capital  for New York and Palm Beach, where she spends the vast majority of her time.\n \n\n   \n  In Washington, she employs  a skeletal staff  compared to the first term — with just five full-time staff members as of July — but those staffers have relocated during the construction to other office space on White House grounds, according to a White House official.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the First Lady and the social office —   which oversees major events at the White House — are now inside the executive mansion, split between the Vermeil Room, the South Mezzanine, the Library and the China Room. Other departments that had office space in the East Wing have been moved to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, including the White House Military Office, the calligraphers, the White House Visitors Office, and the Office of Legislative Affairs, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not responded to CNN’s inquiry as to whether plans for the ballroom construction will include permanent replacement office space for the first lady’s staff.\n \n\n   \n  But the scope of the renovations — and the lack of messaging from Melania Trump’s office — underscores the first lady’s changed role in Washington, which is a departure from her tenure during the first term and that of former first ladies.\n \n\n   \n  In her husband’s first term, Trump was an active steward of White House preservation. She helped oversee the  restoration  of the Bellangé suite of furniture in the Blue Room. She replaced the rug in the Diplomatic Reception Room. She was  involved  in a 2020 redesign of the White House Rose Garden – an effort to improve drainage and audio-visual equipment that drew  criticism  at the time. And shortly after the 2020 election, she unveiled a new White House tennis pavilion, which subsequently  won  multiple architectural awards.\n \n\n   \n  This time around, her husband has spearheaded major projects – and she has declined to weigh in publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “Watching the demolition is the physical embodiment of watching the first lady’s role become smaller and smaller,” said Kate Andersen Brower, author of “First Women,” a book exploring the power and role of modern first ladies.\n \n\n   \n  Brower added: “She’s making it clear that – like her husband – she’s not going to be like any other first lady. … She doesn’t care about historic precedent, either.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing was first constructed in 1902 and the structure was reimagined during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Rosalynn Carter became the first first lady to use the East Wing as her office in 1977.\n \n\n   \n  “Since Monday, I have heard from alumni of the East Wing from multiple administrations who are understandably stunned by the images. First ladies’ staff lived and witnessed history within those walls and nothing can take away the memories of working in that extraordinarily special place of purpose and service,” said Anita McBride, who worked in the East Wing as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush.\n \n\n   \n  And the lack of engagement on the issue from the current first lady has surprised observers.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be like — you’re really close to your next door neighbor, but they decided to demolish your garage for a basketball court, and you didn’t really say anything about it,” said Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist who chronicled the Trump family and wrote the book “Free, Melania.”\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for America’s living former first ladies — Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden — did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on their reaction to the demolition.\n \n\n   \n  But Clinton  weighed  in on social media Tuesday, linking to reports of the demolition: “It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/health/idaho-vaccine-mandates-propublica","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Idaho Bans Vaccine Mandates, Sparking National Debate Over Medical Freedom","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, Idaho passed the Idaho Medical Freedom Act, making it illegal for state or private entities to mandate vaccines, medical tests, or treatments in schools, workplaces, or daycares. The law, championed by activist Leslie Manookian and her group Health Freedom Idaho, reverses traditional public health practices by allowing unvaccinated individuals to remain in public institutions during outbreaks. The law has drawn national attention and is being viewed as a model by anti-vaccine advocates in states like Louisiana and Florida, which have introduced similar legislation. Supporters argue it protects individual bodily autonomy, while public health experts, including the CDC and Paul Offit, warn that it increases risks of disease spread and undermines proven benefits of vaccination. The law has also drawn support from figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Children’s Health Defense, who see it as a fundamental shift in medical decision-making.

Activists want to make it a model for the country \n       \n  By Audrey Dutton, ProPublica\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   This story was originally published by  ProPublica ,  a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.  Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive its stories in your inbox every week. \n \n\n   \n  Three women become choked up as they deliver news in a video posted to social media. “We did it, everybody,” says Leslie Manookian, the woman in the middle. She is a driving force in a campaign that has chipped away at the foundations of modern public health in Idaho. The group had just gotten lawmakers to pass what she called the first true “medical freedom” bill in the nation. “It’s literally landmark,” Manookian said. “It is changing everything.”\n \n\n   \n  With Manookian in  the video  are two of her allies, the leaders of Health Freedom Idaho. It was April 4, hours after the governor signed the  Idaho Medical Freedom Act  into law.\n \n\n   \n  The act makes it illegal for state and local governments, private businesses, employers, schools and daycares to require anyone to take a vaccine or receive any other “medical intervention.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether the law will actually alter day-to-day life in Idaho is an open question, because Idaho already made it easy to get around the few existing vaccination requirements.\n \n\n   \n  But it could have a significant effect in other states, where rules aren’t already so relaxed. And it comes at a time when diseases once eradicated from the U.S. through vaccination are making a resurgence.\n \n\n   \n  The law runs against one of the hallmarks of modern public health: that a person’s full participation in society depends on their willingness to follow certain rules. (Want to send your child to public school? They’ll need a measles vaccine. Want to work in a retirement community during flu season? You might have to wear a mask.)\n \n\n   \n  The new Idaho law flips that on its head. It not only removes the obligation to follow such rules, it makes the rules themselves illegal.\n \n\n   \n  The new law sets Idaho apart from even conservative-leaning South Carolina, where  two schools recently  quarantined more than 150 unvaccinated children after measles arrived.\n \n\n   \n  A person  can spread measles  for four days before symptoms appear. During the South Carolina schools’ quarantine, five students began to show symptoms, but the quarantine kept them from spreading it,  the health department said this month .\n \n\n   \n  That precaution would now be illegal in Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s law caught the attention of people who share Manookian’s belief that — contrary to  hundreds of years of public health evidence and rigorous regulation in the U.S.  — vaccines are worse than the diseases they prevent.\n \n\n   \n  It also caught the attention of people like Jennifer Herricks, a pro-vaccine advocate in Louisiana and  advocacy director for American Families for Vaccines .\n \n\n   \n  Herricks and her counterparts in other states say that vaccine requirements have “done so much good for our kids and for our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  An  analysis published last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  found that routine childhood vaccines prevented more than 1.1 million deaths and 32 million hospitalizations in the U.S. over three decades, saving $540 billion in direct costs and saving society about $2.7 trillion. The analysis was limited; it didn’t account for the lives and money saved by vaccines for flu or RSV, which kill and hospitalize babies and children each year.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s move was “pretty concerning,” Herricks said, “especially seeing the direction that everything is headed at the federal government.”\n \n\n   \n  The law is the culmination of a decade of anti-vaccine activism that got a boost from the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  It’s rooted in a belief system that distrusts institutions — government health agencies, vaccine makers, medical societies and others — on the premise that those institutions seek only money and control.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian said in an interview that she believes one person should never be told to risk their health in “the theoretical” service of another.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Manookian and her allies have a new goal in their sights: to make Idaho’s legislation a nationwide standard.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho was already more permissive than other states when it came to vaccine rules. Parents since at least the 1990s could send unvaccinated children to school if they signed a form saying vaccination went against their religious or personal beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  That wasn’t good enough for Idahoans who describe themselves as advocates for health freedom. They worked to shift the paradigm, bit by bit, so that it can be easier now for parents to get a vaccine exemption than to show the school their child is actually vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, lawmakers ordered schools and daycare centers to tell parents about  the exemptions allowed in Idaho  whenever they communicate about immunizations.\n \n\n   \n  The state also decided to let parents exempt their kids by writing a note, instead of having to fill out a form — one that, in the past, required them to acknowledge the risks of going unvaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  (There is conflicting data on whether these changes truly affected vaccination rates or just led more parents to skip the trouble of handing in vaccine records. Starting in 2021, Idaho schools reported a steady drop in the share of kindergartners with documented vaccinations.  Phone surveys  of parents, by contrast, showed vaccination rates have been largely unchanged.)\n \n\n   \n  An enduring backlash against Idaho’s short-lived COVID-19 mandates gave Manookian’s movement more momentum, culminating this year in what she considered the ultimate step in Idaho’s evolution.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian had a previous career in finance in New York and London. She transitioned to work as a homeopath and advocate, ultimately returning to her home state of Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  The bill she came up with said that almost nobody can be required to have a vaccine or take any test or medical procedure or treatment in order to go to school, get a job or go about life how they’d like to. In practice, that would mean schools couldn’t send unvaccinated kids home, even during a measles outbreak, and private businesses and daycares couldn’t require people on their property to follow public health guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.\n \n\n   \n  Her theory was right, ultimately.\n \n\n   \n  The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.\n \n\n   \n  But the governor vetoed it.  In a letter , he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.\n \n\n   \n  This time, Little signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, D.C., for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.\n \n\n   \n  At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian  told the audience  in May.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing  model legislation and a how-to guide , with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit  Stand For Health Freedom  to mobilize activists in every state.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with ProPublica, Manookian said her objective is for people to “understand and appreciate that the most basic and fundamental of human rights is the right to direct our own medical treatment — and to codify that in law in every state. Breaking that barrier in Idaho proves that it can be done, that Americans understand the importance of this, and the humanity of it, and that it should be done in other states.”\n \n\n   \n  Her efforts were rewarded over the summer with a visit from none other than Kennedy, who visited Boise and toured a farm  with Manookian and state lawmakers in tow. \n \n\n   \n  “This state, more than any other state in the country” aligns with the MAHA campaign, Kennedy told reporters at a news conference where no one was allowed to ask questions. Kennedy called Idaho “the home of medical freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment from Kennedy or his staff on Idaho’s law and his visit to the state.\n \n\n   \n  Children’s Health Defense, the organization Kennedy built into one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines, took interest in the Idaho bill early on.\n \n\n   \n  The group promoted the bill as it sat on the governor’s desk, as he vetoed it, then as Manookian worked successfully to get a revived bill through the statehouse and signed into law.\n \n\n   \n  The organization’s online video programming featured Manookian five times in late March and early April. One show’s host told viewers they could follow Idaho in its “very smart strategy” of taking a law against COVID-related mandates, “crossing out ‘COVID,’ making a few other tweaks, and you have an incredible health freedom bill after that.”\n \n\n   \n  Children’s Health Defense CEO  Mary Holland  said she’s known Manookian for more than 15 years and pushed the national organization to publicize Manookian’s work. Holland introduced her at the Washington, D.C., event.\n \n\n   \n  Whereas most states put the onus on unvaccinated people to show why they should opt out of a mandate, Idaho’s legislation made unvaccinated people the norm — shifting the burden of accommodation onto those who support vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  Now, parents of infants too young for a measles vaccine can’t choose a daycare that requires immunization. Parents of immune-compromised students must decide whether to keep their children home from school during an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases, knowing unvaccinated children won’t be quarantined.\n \n\n   \n  Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements imposed by states like California and New York.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you could certainly do that in Idaho.” Holland said. “It wouldn’t be a public school. It might be the Church of Vaccinia school.”\n \n\n   \n  The day Idaho’s Medical Freedom Act was signed, a legislator in Louisiana brought forward  the Louisiana Medical Freedom Act . In a hearing later, she pointed to Idaho as a model.\n \n\n   \n  Louisiana followed Idaho once before in 2024, when it  passed a law  that requires schools to describe the exemptions available to parents whenever they communicate about immunizations. Idaho had passed an almost identical law three years earlier.\n \n\n   \n  Herricks, the Louisiana pro-vaccine advocate, said she watched the Idaho Medical Freedom Act’s progress with “a lot of concern, seeing how much progress it was making.” Now it’s set a precedent, Herricks said.\n \n\n   \n  Holland, the Children’s Health Defense CEO, said she looks forward to Idaho’s approach spreading.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to a September announcement by Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo that he intends to rid his state of all vaccine mandates. Holland said she expects other Republican-controlled states to take a serious look at the Idaho law. (Ladapo’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big change,” Holland said. “It’s not just related to vaccines. It’s a blow against the notion that there can be compulsory medicine.”\n \n\n   \n  Some people support the  more-than-century-old notion  that compelling people to be vaccinated or masked will provide such enormous collective benefits that it outweighs any inconvenience or small incursion on personal liberty.\n \n\n   \n  Others, like Holland and Manookian, do not.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of laws like Idaho’s is a sense of, “‘I’m going to do what I want to do for myself, and I don’t want anybody telling me what to do,’ which is in direct contrast to public health,” said Paul Offit, pediatrician and vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n \n\n   \n  Offit, who co-invented a vaccine against rotavirus, is a critic of Kennedy and was removed from a federal vaccine panel in September.\n \n\n   \n  A more fundamental conflict is that some people believe vaccines and other tools to prevent the spread of illness, like masks, are harmful. That belief is at odds with the overwhelming consensus of scientists and health experts, including Kennedy’s own  Department of Health and Human Services  and the  CDC .\n \n\n   \n  Both tensions are at play in Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  As is the case nationally, Idaho’s “health freedom” movement has long pushed back against being labeled “anti-vaccine.” Idaho lawmakers and advocates have stressed that their goals are bodily autonomy and informed choice.\n \n\n   \n  They do not take a stance on the bodily autonomy principle when it comes to abortion, however. Almost all state legislators who voted for the Idaho Medical Freedom Act also voted to ban abortion, if they were in office at both times.\n \n\n   \n  “Every action has to be evaluated on its individual morality,” not on whether it does the most good for the most people, Manookian said.\n \n\n   \n  But Manookian’s rejection of vaccine mandates goes beyond a libertarian philosophy.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian has said publicly that she thinks vaccines are “poison for profit,” that continuing to let daycares require vaccination would “put our children on the chopping block,” that measles is “positive for the body,” that the virus protects against cancer, and that it can send people “into total remission” — an assertion she made on an Idaho wellness center’s podcast in April.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian told ProPublica she believes infectious diseases have been made “the bogeyman.”\n \n\n   \n  Against those claims, research has shown that having the measles  suppresses immunity to other diseases , a phenomenon dubbed  “immune amnesia”  that can make children who have recovered from measles  more susceptible to pneumonia and other bacterial and viral infections . About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected will die from complications of the disease,  according to the CDC .\n \n\n   \n  And while researchers have studied using engineered measles viruses in a cancer treatment,  those same researchers have written that  they were “dismayed to learn” their research has been misconstrued by some who oppose vaccination. They said they “very strongly advise” giving children the measles vaccine, that there “is no evidence that measles infection can protect against cancer” and that measles is “a dangerous pathogen, not suitable for use as a cancer therapy.”\n \n\n   \n  (Manookian said she believes she has evidence for her cancer remission claim but couldn’t readily produce it, adding that she may have been mistaken.)\n \n\n   \n  The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, meanwhile, is safe and highly effective, according to  the American Academy of Pediatrics ,  the Infectious Diseases Society of America  and  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , among others. The CDC says the  most common negative reactions  are a sore arm, fever or mild rash. Two doses of the vaccine provide near total protection, according to the CDC.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian said she doesn’t believe the research on vaccines has been adequate.\n \n\n   \n  She will have another chance to spread her views from a prominent platform in November, when she’s scheduled to speak at the  Children’s Health Defense 2025 conference  in Austin, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  She’ll share the stage with celebrities in the anti-vaccine movement: Del Bigtree, communications director for Kennedy’s past presidential campaign; actor Russell Brand; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson; and Ladapo, the Florida surgeon general who made headlines for his push to end vaccine mandates in Florida, months after Idaho wrote that concept into law.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/basketball-nba-wednesday-review-wembanyama-flagg-edgecombe-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:10:00-04:00","title":"3 Things You Missed from the NBA: Wemby vs. Flagg, Historic Rookie Debut, Antetokounmpo Leads Bucks","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NBA season opened with a flurry of standout performances, including Victor Wembanyama’s dominant 40-point, 15-rebound debut against Cooper Flagg, who struggled with only 10 points.

The Thunder then beat the Houston Rockets in a double-OT thriller while the Golden State Warriors were victorious on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you missed from Wednesday’s action across the NBA.\n \n\n   \n    Wemby vs. Flagg\n \n\n   \n  Arguably the game of the night came from Texas where the first overall pick in the 2025 NBA draft,  Cooper Flagg , faced another young sensation in the form of Victor Wembanyama.\n \n\n   \n  Flagg enters the league seen as a potential franchise player, but on Wednesday, he was thoroughly outshone by the 21-year-old Frenchman.\n \n\n   \n  Wembanyama had 40 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks in 30 minutes in a comfortable 125-92 Spurs win. It was a dominant display from the No. 1 pick in the 2023 Draft in which he was serenaded with “M-V-P!” chants despite the game taking place in Dallas’ American Airlines Center.\n \n\n   \n  It was a real marker of Wembanyama’s growth in the league having missed the end of last season with a  blood clot issue . His performance on Wednesday displayed why he’s such a difficult prospect for opposing defenses, with his length leading to easy dunks, incredible ball-handling and three-point shooting, all while being 7-foot-4, something not seen before in the NBA.\n \n\n   \n  And on the defensive side of the court, Wembanyama consistently broke up the Mavs on offense, his long arms often deflecting attempted passes or influencing shots.\n \n\n   \n  “We needed to make a statement,” Wembanyama said afterwards. “We’re all tired of losing, and that’s the truth.”\n \n\n   \n  For Flagg, it was a difficult start to life in the NBA, finishing with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Better days will come for the 18-year-old, but he looked hesitant as he made his first splash into the pro game.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought Cooper played within himself. He took what the defense gave him,” Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said afterwards.\n \n\n   \n  If “Wemby” looks this good the rest of the year – and his career – the league will be on notice.\n \n\n   \n    Historic rookie debut\n \n\n   \n  While Flagg struggled in his first game, the same cannot be said of VJ Edgecombe, the third overall pick this year.\n \n\n   \n  Edgecombe made history in his Philadelphia 76ers debut, scoring 34 points, a franchise record and the third most ever by a rookie in his NBA debut,  per the league .\n \n\n   \n  His 34 points are only beaten by the legendary Wilt Chamberlain’s 43 in 1959 and Frank Selvy’s 35 in 1954.\n \n\n   \n  Edgecombe’s big game came in the 76ers’ narrow 117-116 victory over the Boston Celtics.\n \n\n   \n  The 20-year-old was only outscored by fellow Philly guard Tyrese Maxey, who had 40 points on an efficient 54.2% from the field. Conversely, 2023 NBA MVP Joel Embiid had just four points in 20 minutes on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Boston was without its most important player, Jayson Tatum, who will miss most of the season with a  torn Achilles tendon  suffered during last season’s playoff run.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Greek Freak’ leads Bucks on emotional night for former player\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s game between the Milwaukee Bucks and Washington Wizards was an emotional one, especially for Khris Middleton.\n \n\n   \n  Middleton was making his first appearance in Milwaukee since leaving in the offseason after spending 12 years with the team. He played a vital role in the Bucks winning the 2020-21 NBA title, the franchise’s first title in 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  Middleton was given several standing ovations from the Milwaukee crowd at Fiserv Forum, including when his name was introduced before tip-off, during a tribute video to the forward during a timeout in the first quarter and when he checked out of the game near the end.\n \n\n   \n  “To get that type of recognition, appreciation from the city, the organization, I mean, that meant the world to me,” Middleton said afterwards.\n \n\n   \n  “To get a standing ovation on the road doesn’t happen often, so I wanted to make sure that they knew I acknowledge them. Even though I really don’t speak too much or do too much, but that really meant a lot. That’s every player’s dream to get a standing ovation no matter where they’re at.”\n \n\n   \n  On the court though, things weren’t as accommodating for Middleton and his Wizards.\n \n\n   \n  Led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks ran out comfortable winners by a 133-120 scoreline.\n \n\n   \n  The “Greek Freak” finished with 37 points, 14 rebounds and five assists in 27 minutes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/trump-argentina-beef-deal-farmer-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:39:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s Argentina beef deal angers America’s struggling farmers: ‘You’re selling us out’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has proposed significantly increasing U.S. beef imports from Argentina—raising the annual tariff-free quota from 20,000 to 80,000 metric tons—sparking strong backlash from American cattle ranchers who view it as a betrayal of domestic farmers.

\n        7:39 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said this week he “loved” America’s cattle ranchers. But those farmers, who overwhelmingly supported the president in the 2024 election, say they aren’t feeling the love right now.\n \n\n   \n   Trump is facing criticism  from many US cattle ranchers after signaling support for increasing low-tariff beef imports from Argentina to ease record beef prices in the United States. The move comes just weeks after US soybean farmers blasted a separate deal with Argentina that they fear will give South American producers a competitive edge in that market.\n \n\n   \n  Argentina currently accounts for just over 2% of US beef imports. Under existing rules, it can ship up to 20,000 metric tons a year at a lower tariff rate, with anything above that subject to a 26.4% tariff, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN the administration plans to raise that quota to 80,000 metric tons, effectively quadrupling the amount of Argentinian beef with low tariffs that can enter the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “If Trump goes through with what he outlined, I do believe it’s a betrayal of the American rancher,” Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle farmer and the senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan farm organization, said. “It’s a feeling that you’re selling us out to a foreign competitor.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump reacted to the backlash from cattle ranchers.\n \n\n   \n  “The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil,” Trump wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade association for beef producers, said the organization and its members “cannot stand behind the President while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers by importing Argentinian beef in an attempt to influence prices.”\n \n\n   \n    Why beef prices are at record highs\n \n\n   \n  The price of beef  has climbed significantly this year , up nearly 14% in the past year, according to the latest inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August. (A fresh read on consumer prices is set to be released Friday.)\n \n\n   \n  Becca Jablonski, an agricultural economist who teaches at Cornell University’s Johnson School of Business, said the price increase is fueled by multiple factors.\n \n\n   \n  A recent, multi-year drought decreased the amount of grazing land for cattle and made feed grain significantly more expensive, resulting in a shortage of cattle, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage has also been made worse by an infestation of New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, just across the border in Mexico, significantly curtailing beef imports from that country.\n \n\n   \n  Jablonski said that historically the livestock sector barely makes money, but is having a rare positive year, which allows farmers to pay down debts they accrued during unprofitable years.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the argument the industry is making is, ‘Let us have one good year,’” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the president is keeping his promises to defend farmers and consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump pledged to protect America’s ranchers and deliver economic relief for everyday Americans. The Administration is accomplishing both by expanding beef imports from Argentina to lower consumer prices in the short term while rolling out a new USDA initiative that will support ranchers and expand cattle herd sizes to keep prices lower in the long term,” Kelly said.\n \n\n   \n  Lovell said many of the farmers he knows are just scraping by.\n \n\n   \n  “It is not uncommon for folks in farming to have a year where they report a loss,” he said. “You cannot look at cattle producers that had one good year and say, ‘Oh my gosh, they are just making out like bandits.’”\n \n\n   \n  Lovell blamed price increases on the large meatpacking corporations that buy product from US ranchers and package it for grocery stores.\n \n\n   \n  An influx of imported beef would hurt US farmers, he said, because the large meat packers are not required to label what country their beef comes from.\n \n\n   \n    Soybean farmers reeling from tariff spat\n \n\n   \n  There are some signs that support for Trump in farm country has begun to fray. He won 93% of rural counties in the 2024 election, the highest share of any Republican presidential candidate this century,  according  to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan research organization.\n \n\n   \n  But soybean farmers were among  the first to feel the pain  of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs with China. Since May, China has effectively boycotted American soybeans as a response to Trump’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Even before tariffs, the family farming industry in the United States was already hurting. Since 2017, the country has lost more than 17% of its family farms — at least 100,000 operations — according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs may be exacerbating that pain. Farm bankruptcies  rose in the first half of the year  to the highest level since 2021, according to US courts data.\n \n\n   \n  John Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer and the founder of The National Black Farmers Association, said he had never had a problem selling his soybeans until recently.\n \n\n   \n  “Now nobody’s buying it,” Boyd said. “The largest purchaser of our soybeans was China, and they haven’t placed any orders. Zero.”\n \n\n   \n  “The president thinks his tariffs are the best thing since sliced bread, and it’s putting America’s farmers out of business,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The administration drew backlash last month after agreeing to provide $20 billion in currency support to help stabilize the Argentine peso, a move critics have characterized as effectively bailing out Argentina.\n \n\n   \n   A text message, seen by CNN , sent by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggested that Argentina then used that financial lifeline to strike a deal with China on soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  “We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return the Argentine’s (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,” the message said.\n \n\n   \n  “Here we are losing our farms, and the president is helping out a foreign country,” Boyd said of the deal.\n \n\n   \n    USDA steps in\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  sources told CNN  the White House was planning to extend a multibillion-dollar bailout for farmers. With the government shutdown stretching past its third week, no plan has materialized yet.\n \n\n   \n  Although the USDA has been largely shuttered during the government shutdown, the agency on Wednesday  announced  a plan it said would “strengthen the American beef industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan includes expanding ranchers’ access to federal land for grazing and prioritizing grant applications from military veterans looking to enter the industry, among other measures.\n \n\n   \n  Lovell said that while the plan may be welcome news to many farmers, he felt it didn’t go far enough to protect the industry.\n \n\n   \n  “What US ranchers need is a fair market with the right incentives. We’ve got to encourage rebuilding the cow herd here in the US,” he said.  “This seems to be a quick attempt to control the damage.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/style/paris-fondation-cartier-jean-nouvel","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Fondation Cartier’s new home opens in Paris, in a prized spot facing the Louvre","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Fondation Cartier has opened a new, larger, and more centrally located museum in Paris, directly opposite the Louvre.

prized spot facing the Louvre \n       \n  Vivian Song\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After a years-long renovation project, the Fondation Cartier art museum will open its doors on Saturday to its new home, opposite the Louvre in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  While little has changed externally, the stately 19th-century building, which was a former hotel and department store, has undergone a radical redesign within. The Haussmannian building has been transformed by  Pritzker prize-winning  architect Jean Nouvel, who describes his latest project as an “industrial cathedral” of modular spaces.\n \n\n   \n  The dramatic 70,000-square-foot exhibition space features tall bay windows that create a sense of transparency, blurring the boundaries between the inside and outside world.\n \n\n   \n  Pedestrians, bikers and the city’s traffic serve as complementary, theatrical background sets, while curious passersby can peek through the windows to catch glimpses of the artworks. High glass ceilings near the main entrance funnel in natural light.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Dercon, the museum’s managing director, told CNN that the design “is a dialogue with the history and urban context of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  But the most interesting design feature is no doubt the system of five steel, mobile platforms that can be raised and lowered in nearly a dozen ways to reconfigure the exhibition space, in order to “reinvent” the visitor experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing is permanent,” Mathieu Forest, director of production and architectural design at Ateliers Jean Nouvel studios, told journalists at Monday’s press preview.\n \n\n   \n  “Not the floor, not the walls, not the ceiling…next time, maybe this platform will be higher or lower. You will have an entirely new perspective.”\n \n\n   \n  Cables and pulleys have also been left deliberately exposed, he adds, as they are “live tools” for artists and curators.\n \n\n   \n  The adjustable viewing platforms can also offer different perspectives – and experiences – of a single piece. Standing floor level and gazing head on at Colombian artist Olga de Amaral’s monumental textile work, “Muros en rojos,” reveals the fine details of the thousands of wool and horsehair mosaic-like strips.\n \n\n   \n  Climbing up a few flights of stairs for a view from above and afar, however, changes the viewer’s relationship to the tapestry, as it becomes an autumnal, pixelated amber, red and burnt ochre backdrop that evokes the colors of Amaral’s native Bogota landscape.\n \n\n   \n  “Contemporary art takes on extremely varied forms,” notes Emilie Besse, a French journalist who specializes in the intersection of art and luxury.\n \n\n   \n  “And if we want to be able to present absolutely all forms of creative expression, you need a space that can adapt.”\n \n\n   \n  The inaugural show “Exposition Générale,” is a nod to the building’s heritage as a former 19th century department store, the Grands Magasins du Louvre, which showcased the latest trends in fashion, technologies and household items in museum-like exhibits of the same name. Artworks, curated from the foundation’s existing collection, are categorized under four broad themes that explore architecture, the living world, techniques and materials, and the relationship between science and artistic creation.\n \n\n   \n  Where the modular configuration may risk confusion, however, is in the absence of direction or clear signage that can help visitors make sense of the thematically grouped works.\n \n\n   \n    Luxury brands’ influence on French art world\n \n\n   \n  The innovative arts space, which cost more than an estimated 230 million euros ($267 million) to renovate, according to French media, follows in the foundation’s tradition of shaping the city’s the modern art scene.\n \n\n   \n  When the museum first opened in 1984 in the Paris suburb of Jouy-en-Josas under the direction of Alain Dominique Perrin, it became the first corporate foundation in the country to promote contemporary art, paving the way for the likes of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, which opened in 2014, and the Bourse de Commerce, which houses the contemporary art collection of Kering founder François Pinault and opened in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to understand that, unlike other countries, culture in France has been, for decades, and centuries even, something that was supported by the public sector and that belonged to the state,” explains Fabien Simode, president of the French chapter of the Association of International Art Critics.\n \n\n   \n  “When Cartier arrived in the 1980s, they showed that another path was possible.”\n \n\n   \n  While the relationship between luxury brands and cultural institutions is now firmly established in France, Besse acknowledges that it can still cause some discomfort among some critics.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, when the Grand Palais, which has received tens of millions of euros in donations from Chanel, named one of its main entrance ways after the brand’s founder, Gabrielle Chanel, it raised concerns of commercial opportunism and appropriation of a heritage site, Besse said.\n \n\n   \n  “But ultimately there are very strong affinities between luxury and art, as luxury brands have historically been houses of expertise and creation,” she adds. “So there’s a natural bridge between these two worlds.”\n \n\n   \n  Public and private, luxury-branded institutions also have drastically different approaches that decrease the risk of overlap or competition, Simode points out. While public institutions can sometimes be scientific, encyclopedic, even cold in their faithfulness to detail, private institutions often have more freedom to take an aesthetic and dynamic approach, and have proven their legitimacy, Simode adds.\n \n\n   \n    New visitors\n \n\n   \n  For its opening exhibition the foundation has curated 600 works by 100 international artists including David Lynch, Patti Smith and Damien Hirst, to Congolese artist Bodys Isek Kingelez and Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang.\n \n\n   \n  For Jean-Christophe Castelain, director of the Le Journal des Arts, a bimonthly art publication, the Fondation Cartier’s strength is in scouting international, sometimes little known talents who fall somewhere between big commercial artists whose work appeals to the general public, such as Jeff Koons, and the more obscure, experimental artists who can be radically niche.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fondation Cartier is somewhere in between, and that’s also what makes it so strong,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Castelain cites hyperrealist Australian sculptor Ron Mueck as an example of an artist who got a major boost from the foundation in France after becoming the first French institution to host a solo exhibition back in 2005, and then in 2013 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps more than its initial programming, it’s the museum’s newly central location, increased space – five times the area of its former home – and proximity to the world’s most visited museum, the Louvre, that will attract new audiences, notably tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Nouvel was also the architect behind the Fondation Cartier’s previous site, which opened in 1994 in a quieter neighborhood on the Left Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “The foundation has been moving towards the center of Paris over the last 40 years,” says Simode, adding that the move is analogous to the city’s growing importance on the international art scene.\n \n\n   \n  “Paris has returned to the center stage.”\n \n\n   \n   “Exposition Générale” is on view until August 2026. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/us-cpi-september-inflation-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"A tiny light in an economic data blackout is about to shine through the shutdown for a brief moment","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a two-dozen-day government shutdown that halted federal economic data publication, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the September Consumer Price Index report on Friday, October 24, 2025.

The US government’s shutdown has resulted in a blackout of critical data,  further clouding  an already opaque economic outlook.\n \n\n   \n  That will change – albeit briefly – Friday morning, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release the Consumer Price Index report for September.\n \n\n   \n  The September CPI will allow the data-hungry to get a little fix, providing a snapshot of how prices are trending for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  The report is a one-off of sorts:  BLS staff were called back into the office  this month   to allow the government to meet statutory requirements in adjusting Social Security payments for next year. The September CPI is the final piece of data needed for the 2026 cost of living adjustment.\n \n\n   \n  So, after the CPI is released, darkness once again will envelop federal economic data until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  (And as for the report itself, economists tell CNN that despite the circumstances behind the delayed release, they’re not concerned about the integrity of the underlying data.)\n \n\n   \n    Expect inflation to move back above 3%\n \n\n   \n  Economists expect the latest data to show   that prices for a slew of commonly purchased goods and services rose at a faster-than-typical clip (0.4%) last month. This would lift the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3.1% – the fastest pace in more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  There are many factors behind the upswing, including: pricier gas, food and tariff-impacted goods as well as slower-than-anticipated reduction in inflation on the services side – notably housing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s helpful to remember that the last time inflation was below 2% was in February 2021, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview.\n \n\n   \n  “At the macro level, it’s a reminder of how sticky inflation can be when it gets out of the tube and how hard it is to get to back to that 2% once it’s been above target for a while,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The foods likely to get pricier\n \n\n   \n  American consumers have weathered nearly five years of prices rising faster than they typically should (and prices rose far, far faster than usual for two of those years). However, years of high inflation have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  Food prices, for example, have risen 24% between 2020 and 2024, noted Billy Roberts, senior analyst for food and beverage at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses and rural firms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen smaller degrees of inflation, even over the course of this year, but it’s really that cumulative effect,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In August,  grocery prices jumped 0.6% , the highest monthly increase in nearly three years, according to BLS data. Economists expect the September gain to be more mellow; however, certain categories likely will highlight pain points.\n \n\n   \n  Beef prices, for example,  have risen dramatically  in recent years as herds have shrunk amid  prolonged drought .  Cocoa  and  coffee prices , which have been pushed higher by  climate change  stifling supply, now  face further pressures from tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  Consumers stocking up for trick-or-treaters are now seeing the effects, Roberts said, noting cocoa prices are “still about double, if not triple, what they were in 2022-’23.”\n \n\n   \n  “Those aren’t items that consumers necessarily buy week in and week out,” but they’re buying in bulk now for Halloween, he said. “Those prices are going to provide a lot of sticker shock for consumers.”\n \n\n   \n    The K-shaped economy fallout\n \n\n   \n  Food prices remain a sore spot for many Americans  as do electricity prices , which also have been on the rise, Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those categories, Brusuelas noted he’ll be monitoring services-related inflation — such as airfare and other discretionary areas — and whether it’s remaining stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “What I am concerned about is the sticky and stubborn service sector costs along with rising food and utility prices, which are really placing stress on middle-class and down-market households,” he said. “And this is a function of that greater discussion around the K-shaped economy, where 40% of this country is thriving.”\n \n\n   \n  A recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics found that the country’s top-earners (who have benefited from a surging stock market, rising wages and increased housing wealth)  are accounting for an even greater share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  “Down market,” Brusuelas added, “it’s a very different reality.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/atlanta-airport-threat-safety-security","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Apparent Thwarted Attack at World’s Busiest Airport Highlights Ongoing Security Risks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparent thwarted attack at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport — the world’s busiest airport — occurred when Billy Joe Cagle, a man from Cartersville, was armed and on his way to the airport to shoot up the facility while livestreaming.

And if someone is looking for large groups of people, ticket counters, the lobby areas, the garages, the bag claims, they are not defended by the TSA,” said Mary Schiavo, CNN transportation analyst and former inspector general for the US Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  Enhanced security, like vehicle inspections, were in place after September 11, Schiavo said. Those strict security measures slowed down traffic and travelers and likely would not be welcome again.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody liked it, but it certainly added security,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the measures could be reinstated if similar incidents like the Atlanta case occur again.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavo praised the suspect’s family for coming forward and preventing a potentially significant   attack.\n \n\n   \n  “They not only saved innocent travelers’ lives, they most likely saved their relative’s life because he would have been gunned down,” she said. “There’s lots of cameras and security at the airport that could have responded very quickly. He wouldn’t have made it out. So the family obviously really did a life-saving measure.”\n \n\n   \n  Heightened security could have made a difference in an attack playing out, too, Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  “Checking the cars and checking the bags, the physical security, is what would have made a difference here, if the horrible thing had unfolded … thank God the family called in time.”\n \n\n   \n    Barriers could help\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s apparent thwarted attack will be studied by airport personnel as a success story, according to Keith Jeffries, a former federal security director at Los Angeles International Airport, who spoke to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The communication capability from family to law enforcement and how quick they reacted, that’s tremendous,” Jeffries said. “The fact that the Atlanta Police Department, airport police, responded like they did, that was an exceptional work, to put it mildly”.\n \n\n   \n  However, having cars idle outside terminals or leaving a car behind, such as what happened during Monday’s incident, does present a security risk, Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  Having barriers, even decorative ones, just outside airport doors could help with that, Jeffries added.\n \n\n   \n  “Anytime there’s a large crowd, if someone has bad intentions and wants to make whatever statement or use violence against crowds, that’s a relatively simple thing to do where there’s a crowded area,” Jeffries said. “Putting those barriers in place will help those vehicles from driving straight into an airport, into a crowd … It serves as a bollard to prevent vehicles from pulling up in there.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries, who now serves as the vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, indicated that new technologies might not be the answer to bolster security at airports, unless there’s a machine that can read people’s minds. “That, to my knowledge, doesn’t exist,” he noted.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes all you need is more boots on the ground, like around major travel holidays, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Having a good overt presence, everyone staying alert, being on the lookout. And I think what this is going to do as we approach an even busier season, as Thanksgiving gets closer, I think this message is going to spread like wildfire to all the airports of the value of good communication,” Jeffries said. “This is going to be a great case study for airports to coordinate with the Atlanta Airport on something that went extremely well. Too many times are we studying things that went horribly wrong and learning from that.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s also imperative for travelers to stay alert, calm and vigilant . \n \n\n   \n  “You also need to calm down, pause, and be very aware of your entire domain awareness, what’s going on around you, because at any given point in time, an emergency can occur of some sort, and always just be prepared,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/graham-platner-maine-senate-controversy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"As he remains defiant, Graham Platner’s candidacy for Maine Senate becomes a progressive litmus test","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Graham Platner, a Marine veteran running for Maine U.S. Senate, has become a focal point for internal Democratic debates over candidate standards, as his past online posts and a tattoo resembling Nazi imagery have sparked controversy.

\n  By Eva McKend, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Speaking at a town hall following days of negative revelations about  his online posts  and a  tattoo that resembled Nazi imagery , Graham Platner was defiant.\n \n\n   \n  “The amount of money and time it takes to dig through somebody’s entire past who has not lived a very public life is extensive and yet they are willing to expend those resources,” Platner told the audience in Ogunquit, Maine, on Wednesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not trying to organize people. They are trying to destroy my life,” he pushed back.\n \n\n   \n  As the Democratic Party tries to find its way after last year’s loss to President Donald Trump, progressives are also engaged in an internal struggle over what disqualifies a candidate they like. Platner’s candidacy for US Senate from Maine is the latest litmus test as Democrats try to decide their candidate against moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who has been notoriously hard for Democrats to beat in her career.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters are willing to absorb a certain amount of negativity in a personal life of a candidate in order for it to advance their policy preferences,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  that Platner once referred to himself as a communist and dismissed police as bastards.\n \n\n   \n  Then came a wave of stories showing other posts online in which Platner appeared to downplay sexual assault in the military, questioned whether Black people tip and suggested people who are inebriated are at fault if they put themselves in situations where they could be raped.\n \n\n   \n  In a new video he posted to social media Wednesday before the town hall, Platner apologized for the tattoo and said he had no knowledge the skull and crossbones imagery was associated with Nazis. Platner lifted his shirt to show a new tattoo of a Celtic knot to replace the old one.\n \n\n   \n  Rottinghaus suggests that if Platner can illustrate he can win, the notoriety around his online posts may not ultimately matter to enough voters in a Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  “Partisan voters are willing to trade ideological proximity for some degree of scandalized candidates,” said Rottinghaus.\n \n\n   \n  For many on the left, the gravelly voiced Platner represents what Democrats need in the current political moment: a plainspoken Marine adept at capturing attention and drawing in working-class voters Democrats have lost. He’s commanding big crowds as he campaigns across his home state, running on a platform of supporting Medicare for All and raising the federal minimum wage.\n \n\n   \n  Others argue Platner’s comments and the revelation of his tattoo should be disqualifying and question how progressives would react if a Republican had faced the same revelations, though the GOP has faced similar questions about the muted response of some top conservatives to the disclosure of  antisemitic and violent messages  from a Young Republicans group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Platner has won the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is standing by him.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a young man who served his country in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he went through some really difficult experiences seeing friends of his killed in war,” Sanders said Tuesday, going on to imply that the Democratic establishment is engaged in a campaign of character assassination.\n \n\n   \n  “And despite all of that, he had the courage to run for the United States Senate, to stand up to the powers that be, and to fight for the working class of this country,” he added. “I personally think he is an excellent candidate. I’m going to support him and look forward to him becoming the next senator in the state of Maine.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has voiced support for Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who  announced her bid last week .\n \n\n   \n  “We think that Janet Mills is the best candidate to retire Susan Collins. She’s a tested two-term governor and the people of Maine have an enormous amount of affection and respect for her,” Schumer said.\n \n\n   \n  Platner is not the only Democratic politician facing criticism about his past statements.\n \n\n   \n  When news broke earlier this month of violent text messages Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia attorney general, sent in 2022, it  roiled the off-year election in the state .\n \n\n   \n  In a private exchange between Jones and Republican Virginia Delegate Carrie Coyner, Jones griped about how the then-speaker of the House of Delegates, Republican Todd Gilbert, was paying tribute to a former moderate Democratic lawmaker who died, according to screenshots of text messages obtained by CNN. “Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” the text reads in part, referring to Gilbert and the two dictators.\n \n\n   \n  But in the weeks since, Democrats have been steadfast in their support for Jones and disciplined in their messaging in response to the scandal. They have denounced the texts as indefensible but argued Virginia voters should have the opportunity to decide Jones’ fate, they say — and by the time Republicans released the information, hundreds of thousands of Virginians had already started voting.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean for me, it’s a little more personal, because I’ve known Jay all his life, and his family and my family go back decades,” said Angelia Williams Graves, a state senator representing Norfolk.\n \n\n   \n  “No matter what was in those text messages, I know that Jay Jones is not willing to sacrifice Virginians for Donald Trump,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Platner was introduced Wednesday night by his mother following a performance by a Maine singer songwriter. He spent much of the town hall talking about the significance of broadening the Democratic coalition.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t care if you voted for Donald Trump, if you voted for Kamala Harris or you didn’t vote, you go around this state right now, you go ask any working person, do you think you work in an economic and political system that is built with your interest at heart, nobody says yes. Everybody knows that they are being robbed,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He echoed many of the policy ideas he shares with Sanders and told the crowd he is committed to staying in the race.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly they haven’t spent a lot of time around Marines,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"04:21:00-04:21","title":"Takeaways from the second general election debate in the NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the second and final general election debate of the 2025 NYC mayoral race, Democrat Zohran Mamdani engaged in a heated confrontation with independent Andrew Cuomo, challenging his claims of lack of experience and credibility.

Wright, Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:21 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This time, the gloves came off.\n \n\n   \n  Democrat  Zohran Mamdani  clashed with independent  Andrew Cuomo  from the first moments of Wednesday’s second and final general election debate for New York City mayor. Cuomo called Mamdani divisive and said he lacked experience or new ideas, while Mamdani said the former governor, down in the polls, was a “desperate man lashing out.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo was looking for a moment to change the race’s contours less than two weeks from Election Day while Mamdani both sought to lock in his lead and establish himself  as winning the “battle over the soul” of the national Democratic Party . The two tore into each other in strikingly personal terms on their backgrounds, their policy ideas and how each would address antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  Republican nominee  Curtis Sliwa , meanwhile, reprised his wildcard role as he refuses to bow to a pressure campaign from some in his party to leave the race.\n \n\n   \n  Here are key moments from the debate:\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo gives Mamdani a dressing-down about experience\n \n\n   \n  In a pivot from his frequent reference to his time in government, Cuomo sought to put distance between his record as governor and New York City’s municipal failures. Notably for someone elected governor three times, Cuomo argued that “the city has been getting screwed by the state, and that has to change.”\n \n\n   \n  But the exchange gave Mamdani an opening to attack Cuomo for his record as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “The governor doesn’t build housing in New York City,” Cuomo said in response to a question on housing policy.\n \n\n   \n  “Not if it’s you,” Mamdani retorted.\n \n\n   \n  That led to Cuomo accused Mamdani of never having “accomplished anything.”\n \n\n   \n  “I did things; you have never had a job,” Cuomo said motioning towards Mamdani and drawing applause from the crowd. “There is no reason to believe you have any merit or qualification for 8.5 million lives. You don’t know how to run a government.”\n \n\n   \n  He went on to paint Mamdani as an inexperienced legislator who is unprepared to lead America’s biggest city and would be dangerous in the event of an emergency.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know how to handle an emergency, and you literally never proposed a bill on anything that you’re not talking about in your campaign,” Cuomo said, his voice rising.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Mamdani accused Cuomo of creating “his own facts.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just had a former governor say in his own words that the city has been getting screwed by the state,” Mamdani said. “Who was leading the state? It was you. You were leading the state for 10 years, screwing the city.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani tears into Cuomo’s experience argument\n \n\n   \n  “You will hear from Andrew Cuomo about his experience as if the issue is that we don’t know about it,” Mamdani said at one point. “The issue is that we have all experienced your experience.”\n \n\n   \n  To underscore that argument, Mamdani’s campaign invited Charlotte Bennett, a former aide in Cuomo’s administration who  accused him of sexual harassment  in 2021. Cuomo resigned from office under the cloud of that investigation though he has denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Given a chance to question Cuomo, Mamdani raised the sexual harassment cases.\n \n\n   \n  “You sought to access her private gynecological records,” Mamdani said. “She cannot speak up for herself because you lodged a defamation case against her. I, however, can speak. What do you say to the 13 women that you sexually harassed?”\n \n\n   \n  The question drew applause from Mamdani supporters in the audience. Cuomo responded at first by suggesting Mamdani was being unserious and immature. He then launched into his defense, saying five district attorneys declined to pursue the cases and that he has not been found criminally or civilly liable.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo then turned to Mamdani to attack him for appearing in a picture with a Ugandan politician known for her anti-LGBTQ positions.\n \n\n   \n   “Had I known that the first deputy minister was the architect of that legislation, I would not have taken that photo,” Mamdani said. “I also know that this constant attempt to smear and slander me is an attempt to also distract from the fact that, unlike myself, you do not actually have a platform or set of policies to protect those same New Yorkers here.”\n \n\n   \n    The three candidates talk about ICE and Trump\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids in New York City emerged as a flashpoint early in the debate, as all three candidates rejected the federal crackdown and argued over who was best able to deal with President Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo said that “we don’t need ICE to do quality-of-life crimes,” after a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement  raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street  in Manhattan Tuesday. Mamdani argued the agency “cares little for the law and even less for the people that they’re supposed to serve.” And Sliwa agreed that “the feds should not have stepped into this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  But the candidates diverged sharply on how they’d approach Trump. Cuomo said that “you’re going to have to confront” him while Sliwa suggested that “you can’t beat Trump, he holds most of the cards,” saying that “you have to try to negotiate.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, meanwhile, said that he was open to working with Trump on lowering the cost of living but pivoted to attacking Cuomo, saying that Trump “wants Andrew Cuomo to be the mayor, not because it will be good for New Yorkers, but because it will be good for him.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo shot back that Trump would take advantage of Mamdani’s youth and inexperience to press his crackdown on the city.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump, I believe, wants Mamdani. That is his dream, because he will use him politically all across the country, and he will take over New York City. Make no mistake, it will be President Trump and Mayor Trump, and he will come in and take over the city,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Then he worked in a bit of Yiddish.\n \n\n   \n  “He has no respect for him,” Cuomo said. “He thinks he’s a kid and he’s going to knock him on his tuchus.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani’s rivals gang up on him about ballot measures\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo and Sliwa briefly ganged up on Mamdani over his refusal to take a position on a set of controversial ballot measures New Yorkers will weigh in this election year.\n \n\n   \n  At one point, holding his hands up in the air and swaying side to side as if to mock Mamdani for talking too much, Cuomo attacked Mamdani for not having yet made his position clear.\n \n\n   \n  “What a political answer. What is your opinion, Zohran?” Sliwa demanded.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes or no?” Cuomo joined in.\n \n\n   \n  “I think on this stage, you can see two people appealing for the Republican Party’s votes,” Mamdani chimed in over the crosstalk. Pressed to answer, he conceded, “I have not yet taken a position on those ballot amendments.”\n \n\n   \n  There are six ballot proposals covering a range of topics, including significant housing reform, a change to election years and the construction of a sports complex on forest land.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani sends a clear signal about policing\n \n\n   \n  For months, Mamdani has said  he would consider keeping New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch  if elected but has stopped short of committing to asking her to stay on.\n \n\n   \n  That changed Wednesday. Just before the debate began, two people familiar with the plan confirmed to CNN that Mamdani intends to ask Tisch to stay on the job if he is elected mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s decision,  first reported  by The New York Times, signals his attempt to moderate as the general election nears and he continues to face criticism, especially on his previous critiques of the police.\n \n\n   \n  “I can confirm that reporting,” Mamdani said on the debate stage.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has walked back previous calls to defund the police and has apologized to officers for referring to them as “racist” and “wicked” in social media posts.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear if Tisch, who is highly regarded in the city’s political circles, would stay on even if asked.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo and Sliwa also said they would ask Tisch to stay on as commissioner.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani faces criticism about antisemitism\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani  again addressed Jewish voters  who are concerned about his criticisms of Israel and question his commitment to fighting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  “I look forward to being a mayor for every single person that calls the city home,” he said, adding: “All 8.5 million New Yorkers, and that includes Jewish New Yorkers who may have concerns or opposition to the positions that I’ve shared about Israel and Palestine.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s opponents, however, expressed skepticism and accused him of promoting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re the savior of the Jewish people? You won’t denounce ‘Globalize the Intifada,’ which means ‘Kill Jews,’” Cuomo said, referencing the controversial phrase that  Mamdani has discouraged using  and noting that hundreds of rabbis had signed a letter criticizing him. “There’s unprecedented fear in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa made a personal appeal to Mamdani, referencing his own Jewish family members, saying that members of the community were “scared.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me speak on behalf of my two sons when they’ve heard some of the statements you’ve made,” Sliwa said. “They view you as the arsonist who fans the flames of antisemitism. They cannot suddenly accept the fact that you’re coming in like a firefighter and you’re going to put out these flames. You’ve got a lot of explaining to do, a lot of apologizing to do.”\n \n\n   \n  He also alleged that Mamdani, who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor, had praised “global jihad.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani responded that “there is room for disagreement on many positions and many policies.” But he also pushed back.\n \n\n   \n  “I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said and that continues to be ascribed to me,” he said. “And frankly, I think much of it has to do with the fact that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election.”\n \n\n   \n    Sliwa goes after Cuomo; Cuomo fires back\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s allies have pressured Sliwa to drop out of the race so the former governor can consolidate opposition to Mamdani. Sliwa has rejected that push with his characteristic bluntness and color, referencing the movie “Braveheart” earlier Wednesday in  suggesting he would choose death  over working for a Cuomo mayoral administration.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa challenged Cuomo repeatedly, including on the sexual misconduct allegations that led him to resign as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “The only reason that Zohran is on this stage is because of the failed Gov. Cuomo, who was rejected by the Democrats in the primary and rejected by 13 women who charged you with sexual harassment,” Sliwa said. “Do you ever know that no means no? Do you know what no means, Cuomo?”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo responded by accusing Sliwa of tax fraud, claiming that he’d failed to properly disclose donations to his crime prevention organization, the Guardian Angels. “So I think that’s the person who has explaining to do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At another point, Sliwa accused Cuomo of cutting funding for hospital beds for people with mental illnesses, ending his point with “Shame on you!”\n \n\n   \n  Retorted Cuomo: “There’s one bed I’m going to save for you.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/france-louvre-director-heist-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"03:42:00-04:00","title":"No security cameras covered Louvre balcony where thieves entered, director says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris involved thieves using a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery balcony on Sunday, October 1, 2025.

She said she’d offered her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati after the robbery, but it was rejected.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars, who took the role in 2021, said the museum’s weakness lies in the lack of perimeter protection, which she said was a result of “chronic underinvestment in equipment and infrastructure.”\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre’s last major renovation was in the 1980s under former French President François Mitterrand, who commissioned Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei to design an entrance befitting the historic venue.\n \n\n   \n  The glass pyramid that now forms the entrance to the museum opened to the public in 1989, putting a modern face on a storied institution known for its exhibition of the world’s finest art.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars said that renovation project may have created an illusion of momentum behind the museum being fully modernized. However, she said: “This major modernization project is now 40 years old, with facilities that have outperformed and are at the end of their tether.”\n \n\n   \n    How it happened\n \n\n   \n  The heist unfolded at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday when robbers parked a truck with a mobile ladder outside the gallery. At 9:34 a.m. they triggered an alarm on the second-floor door, which sent a signal to a security post.\n \n\n   \n  A security officer inside the auditorium radioed to report an intrusion and staff began evacuating members of the public. Alarms on two high-security display cases were triggered as the thieves cut holes in the glass to grab the jewels.  At 9:36 a.m. police were called. A minute later, a message was broadcast requesting that the doors be closed. By 9.38 a.m. the thieves had left the building.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance teams outside the museum prevented the suspects from setting their vehicle alight but could not prevent their escape on scooters along the banks of the Seine. A law enforcement official said investigators combed the truck for any traces of DNA. One of the two scooters had been retrieved as well as a helmet worn by one of the suspects, the official added.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars said Wednesday the security system inside the Apollo Gallery “worked perfectly” – but that it was designed several years ago to protect against the greatest risks of that time. For example, the high-security display cases that housed the jewels were designed to withstand bullets.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, this was the dominant modus operandi for this type of attack, for precious objects, jewelry, attacks in jewelry stores,” des Cars said. “That’s what the Louvre is protecting itself against.”\n \n\n   \n  She said what’s needed now is to adapt the system to a  “new type of attack, to new operating methods that had not been envisaged.” \n \n\n   \n  The theft had “profoundly shocked” the museum’s staff, French citizens and “all those who love the Louvre,” des Cars said.\n \n\n   \n  She suggested measures that could be put in place to enhance the museum’s security, such as fortifying the outer edges of the Louvre and prohibiting cars from parking in the vicinity.  Des Cars said she’s also considering whether it would be possible to install a police station inside the museum.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/americas/maduro-trump-venezuela-military-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:28:00-20:30","title":"Maduro boasts of ‘thousands’ of Russian anti-aircraft missiles as Trump threatens military action inside Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro claims Venezuela possesses 5,000 Russian-made Igla-S anti-aircraft missiles, deployed across the country including remote areas, as part of a defensive posture against U.S. military actions.

“key air defense positions,” its President Nicolás Maduro claimed on Wednesday, amid growing tension over the United States’ military deployment in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has said he is weighing military action inside Venezuela as part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign and a broader effort to weaken Maduro, a longtime foe of Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “Any military force in the world knows the power of the Igla-S and Venezuela has no less than 5,000” of them, Maduro said during an event with military personnel broadcast by Venezolana de Televisión (VTV).\n \n\n   \n  The Russian Igla-S missiles are short-range, low-altitude systems similar to American Stingers. They can shoot down small aerial targets such as cruise missiles and drones, as well as helicopters and low-flying planes.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro said the missiles, light enough to be carried by a single soldier, had been deployed “even in the last mountain, the last town, and the last city of the territory.”\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed 4,500 Marines and sailors to the Caribbean to strengthen operations against cartels and demonstrate military power. It has carried out several lethal strikes on boats  off the Caribbean  coast that it alleges were trafficking narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers from both parties in the US have questioned the legality of the strikes on the alleged “narco boats.”\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Trump said he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the US was considering expanding its military campaign to land, as part of an intensifying US pressure campaign that officials say is aimed at ousting Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months, by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has been responding by repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia members and denouncing US activity in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The people of Venezuela are “clear, united, and aware,” Maduro said in a televised speech last week.\n \n\n   \n  “They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   \n  According to  Rosoboronexport , the Russian state company that exports Igla-S systems, they have a range of up to 6,000 meters and can reach targets at a maximum altitude of 3,500 meters.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of Igla-S missiles cited by Maduro, but they were known to be part of Venezuela’s arsenal, according to the military balance compiled by the  International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). \n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, has been photographed several times with the launchers in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has contacted Venezuela’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00.000Z","title":"White House Releases List of Donors for Trump’s Multi-Million-Dollar Ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House has released a list of major corporate and individual donors who have contributed to President Donald Trump’s proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which Trump claims is privately funded and not a taxpayer expense.

companies and calls on Moscow to agree to immediate ceasefire \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, Kit Maher, Kaitlan Collins, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:41 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies as it called on Moscow to agree to an immediate ceasefire in  the war with Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump had for weeks signaled he could impose penalties against Russia for its continuation of the war but had failed to take major punitive measures until Wednesday. The announcement came as Trump said he had “canceled” an anticipated meeting with Putin because he “didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get.”\n \n\n   \n  In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump explained he “felt it was time” for the sanctions, noting he “waited a long time” to impose them. Still, the US president said he hopes “they won’t be on for long” because the war will end.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement Wednesday that it was “the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire.”\n \n\n   \n  “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent added: “Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions hit Rosneft and Lukoil and almost three dozen of their subsidiaries. The United Kingdom targeted the two oil companies last week, and the European Union formally adopted another package of sanctions, includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports, on Thursday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The EU’s sanctions envoy David O’Sullivan will meet with top Treasury Department official John Hurley on Thursday, a Treasury spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna praised Wednesday’s announcement, which she said “comes after numerous attempts to give Russia a chance to begin real negotiations to end the war.”\n \n\n   \n  “The decision is fully aligned with Ukraine’s consistent position: peace is possible only through strength and pressure on the aggressor using all available international tools,” Stefanishyna said in  a post on X , adding that she also expects “strong decisions from European partners tomorrow, following the meeting of the European Council.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine had been calling for increased pressure on Moscow as the war has raged on. Diplomatic efforts to end the war have stalled and Russia has rejected the notion of freezing the conflict for negotiations – something that Ukraine and Europe have said they support.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said last week that he intended to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. However, Trump said on Wednesday he had “canceled” that anticipated summit, telling reporters, “It just didn’t feel right to me,” although he said they would meet in the future.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier this week  that Trump’s hopes for a quick meeting with Putin had stalled out , with an administration official saying Tuesday there were “no plans” for a summit between the two “in the immediate future.”\n \n\n   \n  The impact of the new US sanctions will be greatly determined by how they are implemented and whether the administration pushes ahead with secondary sanctions, one expert told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “So far what’s come out is these primary sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, but the key then will be if there’s a threat of secondary sanctions on banks, oil refineries and traders in third countries who are dealing with Rosneft and Lukoil,” said Eddie Fishman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the Biden administration announced sanctions on other  top Russian oil companies , but held off on targeting Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  Officials argued at the time that they waited until the waning days of the administration to impose the sanctions in part because of the state of the global oil market and the potential impact on the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously wavered on imposing further sanctions on Russia.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at the G7 in June why not impose sanctions, Trump said, “When I sanction a country, it costs the US a tremendous amount of money,” adding, “Sanctions are not easy. It is not just a one-way street.”\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement came hours after Russia launched a  large-scale air attack  on Ukraine, including Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Wednesday, Bessent previewed the new sanctions as “one of the largest,” noting  Trump’s disappointment  with Putin and the state of talks to end the war in Ukraine, following a  summit in Alaska  more than two months ago.\n \n\n   \n  “President Putin has not come to the table in an honest, forthright manner as we hoped. There were talks in Alaska; President Trump walked away when he realized that things were not moving forward,” Bessent told Fox Business. “There have been behind-the-scenes talks, but I believe that the president is disappointed at … where we are in these talks.”\n \n\n   \n  “These are sanctions, not secondary tariffs,” Bessent added. “These are going to be substantial and powerful, and we are urging our European and G7 allies plus Canada and Australia to come along with us.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/ukraine-sweden-gripen-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00-04:00","title":"Ukraine Could Get 150 Advanced Swedish Fighter Jets Under Just-Signed Deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine has signed a letter of understanding with Sweden, a newly admitted NATO member, to receive up to 150 advanced Saab Gripen-E fighter jets.

Swedish fighter jets under just-signed deal \n       \n  By Brad Lendon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:49 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New NATO member Sweden has said it is willing to sell Ukraine up to 150 of its most advanced fighter jets, the first offer from a member of the alliance to supply significant numbers of jets to Kyiv, which is seeking to upgrade its small and ageing air force.\n \n\n   \n  The deal signed on Wednesday by Volodymyr Zelensky and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson is a letter of understanding, meaning exact terms, costs and delivery dates for 100 to 150 Saab Gripen-E jets are yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  But both leaders said it has the potential to be a game changer, not only for Ukraine –   which desperately needs more air combat capabilities in its fight against Russia – but for NATO and European security overall.\n \n\n   \n  “We are opening an entirely new and truly meaningful chapter in our relations — relations between Ukraine and Sweden, and more broadly, overall security relations in Europe,” Zelensky in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “These are very cool planes, powerful aviation platforms that allow for performing a wide range of tasks,” Zelensky said.\n \n\n   \n  “This will strengthen both Ukraine, Sweden and Europe,” Kristersson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Sweden joined NATO in 2024 along with its Nordic neighbor Finland. Their accession to the alliance – which ended longstanding policies of non-alignment – was spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Fighter jets have been a critical need for Ukraine since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of its neighbor. At the time, Ukraine’s air force consisted largely of Soviet-era aircraft. While Western countries have come to Kyiv’s aid with older US-made F-16 models as well as a handful of French Mirages, those have not been enough to counter Russian air superiority.\n \n\n   \n  But the Gripen-E is considered by experts to be well-suited to operating conditions in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Gripen fighters have the reputation of being relatively cheap and easy to maintain and arm, and able to operate in austere conditions – using roads or even dirt roads for runways.\n \n\n   \n  While the first version of the jet dates to the late 1980s, the E model just entered service with the Swedish Air Force earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Gripen-E models have so many upgrades that they are “in many respects a new aircraft type,” with new radar and communication systems, better sensors and the ability to deploy new weapons, the Swedish Armed Forces said in a release at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Manufacturer Saab calls the single-engine Gripen-E “the game changer” with the ability to network sensors and coordinate missile launches among the fleet. At the same time, the jets have embedded AI capability, Saab says.\n \n\n   \n  Each jet has 10 “hard points” to attach missiles that can strike other air and ground targets.\n \n\n   \n  The Gripen-E will be familiar to pilots who have flown earlier models, it said.\n \n\n   \n  That could become important as Ukrainian pilots have tested and trained on older Gripen jets and simulators, the communications chief for Ukraine’s air force said Wednesday in  a report from RBC-Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  With that training, some observers have raised the possibility of Ukraine getting older Gripen models to tide them over until the E models arrive in about three years.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Zelensky told a press conference in Sweden that he hoped his country could receive and start using the Gripens next year.\n \n\n   \n  “For our army, Gripens are a priority,” he said,  according to Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  If the deal is completed with 150 jets eventually going to Ukraine, Kyiv could become the top operator of the Gripen-E worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  Besides Sweden, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand fly Gripens.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement came just days after Zelensky’s attempt to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles to use in strikes deep into Russia was rebuffed by US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Wednesday that one of the reasons he denied Zelensky’s request is that Tomahawks require a long training period.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with the Tomahawk that a lot of people don’t know, it’ll take a minimum of six months, usually a year, to learn how to use them. They’re highly complex,” Trump said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/asia/south-korea-president-lee-jae-myung-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-04:00","title":"South Korea’s President Downplays US Trade Rift and Welcomes Trump as ‘Peacemaker’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung reassures the world that US-South Korea relations remain strong despite recent trade tensions and diplomatic friction, welcoming US President Donald Trump as a potential peacemaker in North Korea talks.

downplays US trade rift and welcomes Trump as ‘peacemaker’ \n       \n  By Will Ripley, Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae, Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:05 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   South Korea’s  President Lee Jae Myung   hailed his nation’s relationship with the United States in a CNN interview on Wednesday, pushing aside lingering trade concerns and welcoming US President Donald Trump ,  who is about to visit Asia, as a “peacemaker.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee acknowledged tensions in the Korean Peninsula had “gotten worse” in recent years,   speaking several hours after North Korea  test fired ballistic missiles  in its first such military show of force   since he took office in June.\n \n\n   \n  But he played down the risk, reiterating the need to pursue peace and dialogue – and raised the possibility of Trump bridging the gap between the two Koreas.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope that (Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un) will be able to engage in dialogue,” he said. “I also believe that President Trump wants to achieve world peace, and that is why I have made the recommendation for him to take on the role of a peacemaker.”\n \n\n   \n  While the chances that  Trump will meet Kim  during his multi-stop visit to Asia later this month remain low, Lee said it would be “a good thing” if the “leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump met Kim  several times during his first term , holding landmark summits that ultimately failed to produce a meaningful breakthrough. But earlier this summer in a White House meeting with Lee, the US president said he was  willing to meet Kim again .\n \n\n   \n  Trump is also expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping next week when South Korea hosts the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit  in Gyeongju, attended by leaders and delegations from across the region.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said as recently as Friday that he intends to meet Xi on the sidelines of the key summit, though it’s not clear where or when this will happen. Tensions remain high between  the two rival powers , after another trade spat and slew of tariff threats.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea has always walked a fine line in navigating its relationships with the US and China. Seoul and Washington have been staunch allies for more than seven decades – drawing closer in recent years in a joint effort to combat growing Chinese influence in the Asia-Pacific region. South Korea is also home to the US military’s largest overseas base, which houses 41,000 people including troops and their families.\n \n\n   \n  But South Korea and China have also maintained a strong trading relationship.\n \n\n   \n  “We have different ideologies and also a different system of government … (but) we cannot shut out China,” Lee said, adding that the “vital” US alliance made managing the China relationship “a bit delicate.”\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to relationships between countries, you cannot cut it clean with a knife and say: ‘This country is our friend, and this country is not.’ It’s just not that simple – it’s much more complicated and complex,” said Lee.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambitions and growing capabilities in high-tech industries present a challenge to South Korea, long seen as a global leader in such critical sectors.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that Chinese companies were catching up with (and in some cases overtaking) South Korean ones, Lee said there remained “many areas where Korean firms can win,” such as semiconductors and automobiles.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea is   committed to sharing this expertise with the US too, Lee said, emphasizing their bilateral relationship included economic, technological, and military cooperation.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past we have received a lot of assistance from the United States, and so we are willing to provide assistance for the US’ efforts to  revamp its manufacturing industry  to the extent possible,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  His tone was notably warm, despite the US-South Korea relationship being strained in recent months by Trump’s immigration crackdown. Nearly  500 people , mostly Korean nationals, were arrested and detained during an ICE raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia last month, sparking outrage back home. The car maker is one of South Korea’s largest companies.\n \n\n   \n  After the detainees were flown back to South Korea, Trump posted online that he didn’t want to “frighten off or disincentivize investment into America by outside countries or companies.”\n \n\n   \n  South Korea has also had to contend with Trump’s tariff demands, which came as the country was dealing with the fallout from Lee’s predecessor  briefly declaring martial law , then cycling through a revolving door of interim leaders as the economy spluttered.\n \n\n   \n  In late July, barely a month into his tenure, Lee  negotiated a trade deal  with the Trump administration to avert high tariffs on Korean exports, including a $350 billion investment flow from South Korea to the US. But detailed negotiations have dragged out, leaving the country’s key auto making industry at a disadvantage – subject to 25% US tariffs while its rivals in Japan and Europe have already secured much lower rates.\n \n\n   \n  Lee acknowledged there are “differences in opinion” between South Korea and the US in the ongoing talks, but said he believed “that eventually we will get there because the United States is the leading country when it comes to the values of democracy and the free market system.”\n \n\n   \n  Some critics have slammed Trump’s tariff demands as extortionate – especially for longtime allies and friends like South Korea. When asked what he thought of this, Lee simply laughed.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that we will, in the end, be able to reach a rational result that can be acceptable,” he said, smiling.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-potential-230-million-doj-payment-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:34:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s potential $230 million DOJ payment would be astonishing — even for him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversial possibility that former President Donald Trump could receive $230 million in damages from the Department of Justice (DOJ) over alleged rights violations during investigations into the Russia probe and classified documents case.

12:34 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The idea of a president convincing his own Justice Department to furnish him with nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in taxpayer cash seems too absurd to take seriously.\n \n\n   \n  Putting aside unfathomable ethical implications, such a move would be one of the most glaring examples of a political tin ear in modern times, as many Americans struggle to pay rent or buy groceries.\n \n\n   \n  For this reason, there must be a good chance that  Donald Trump’s reported claims for damages  over the DOJ’s past investigations into his conduct is a step too far even for him.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has often fashioned a new normality with his outlandish moves. His life in business and politics has been one long and lucrative attempt to apply leverage for personal or financial gain and to sate his thirst for payback. In an inverted political world, where he’s destroyed curbs that constrain presidents and turned the DOJ into a boutique personal law firm, the notion of a bumper personal payout cannot be immediately dismissed as a fantasy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump declined the chance to do so himself in the Oval Office Tuesday after  the New York Times  reported on the claims. While he initially seemed hazy on details of the two claims, he didn’t rule anything out,  saying they “could be”  something he’d pursue.\n \n\n   \n  And in his unique way, in which he sometimes seems more like a commentator on his own presidency than its perpetrator, he put his finger on what makes this situation so bizarre — without apparently computing why people are worried about the idea. “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself,” the president mused before his political antennae kicked in and he pledged to donate any money he might get to charity.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has often described himself as the nation’s top legal officer, he wouldn’t in theory have the final say on the matter. That would fall to officials including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. But since Blanche is Trump’s former personal lawyer, that distinction may not matter very much.\n \n\n   \n  A full 24 hours after the Times story broke, there was still no full on-the-record denial from the White House. The complaints were filed as an administrative claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act — a first step to see whether a settlement is possible before someone can sue for damages. The Times reported Trump was seeking $230 million in total compensation in claims filed before his reelection over alleged rights violations in the Russia investigation during his first term and the probe into his alleged hoarding of classified documents.  CNN previously reported on that claim , which sought $100 million. Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump or his 2016 campaign conspired with Russia. The classified documents case was dropped when Trump won the 2024 election on the grounds that presidents cannot be prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n    One word that rarely worries the White House: ethics\n \n\n   \n  Trump would face multiple political and ethical hurdles if he decided to push his claims to a conclusion. The role of Blanche — who acted for the president and presumably billed him for his services in the classified documents case — is only one of the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  To begin with, the symbolism of a billionaire president lining his pockets with taxpayer money would be jarring, especially when  the government is shut down , thousands of essential workers are showing up without pay and  nutrition benefits for needy Americans  are in danger of running out.\n \n\n   \n  “Particularly right now, we’re talking about a quarter of a billion dollars transferring, maybe, to the president when we’re in a shutdown posture, so it’s at very best bad timing, but I think it’s horrible optics,” said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who is more prone to speaking out than many of his Trump-fearing colleagues since he’s not seeking reelection.\n \n\n   \n  Even a Democratic Party that has struggled to pin down Trump with an effective counteroffensive could surely make hay with such a spectacle, especially amid a shutdown they triggered  over high health care costs . Trump would risk a voter backlash in testing economic times. A CBS News poll earlier this month found that the economy, jobs and inflation were top concerns. Some 75% thought Trump wasn’t focusing enough on the price of goods and services at a time when he’s threatening to send troops into US cities, conducting  lethal strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats  on the oceans, and pursuing personal vanity  architectural projects .\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump has never shown great concern about reaching beyond his political base. And many of his voters share his view that he was persecuted by the Justice Department, despite substantial evidence of wrongdoing — which the president denied — and two grand jury indictments. He’s often proved he’s got more leeway than many pundits think.\n \n\n   \n  “Taxpayers pay for a lot of things … about $2 trillion more than they should every year,” Trump loyalist and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Wednesday. “But I hope they work it out. And I know the president is just trying to put pressure on the DOJ, to say, ‘Listen, this was wrongly done.’”\n \n\n   \n    An increasingly profligate administration\n \n\n   \n  Any decision to pay Trump would underscore the president’s felling of the traditional wall between the White House and Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Normally, the officials involved might be expected to recuse themselves. But the fate of Jeff Sessions, the Trump first-term attorney general who recused himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation — and bought himself  a ticket out of the administration  — offers a cautionary tale. And can there be any expectation that Blanche or Attorney General Pam Bondi would risk their jobs to defy Trump after multiple examples of Justice Department obedience to a president who is using the  machinery of government  to pursue his  political enemies ?\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s one more example where Donald Trump is using the Justice Department as his private playground, trying to fleece his pockets,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday. “He’s just going to just see if his puppets that he put in that Justice Department are going to perform for him … he doesn’t think they should conflict themselves out. Perhaps they will. But he deliberately put his personal lawyers in there.”\n \n\n   \n  If Trump did snag a big payout from the DOJ, he’d exacerbate criticisms that he’s using his post to  boost his personal and familial wealth , despite his past vows to “drain the swamp.” Democrats have complained that Trump and his clan made hundreds of millions of dollars in a  cryptocurrency boom  unleashed by his government’s friendly policies toward the industry. The US has meanwhile taken delivery of  a jumbo jet from Qatar  that he plans to use for his new Air Force One and that raised massive ethics concerns, given the Gulf nation’s role in US foreign policy. And first lady Melania Trump will feature in a  big-budget Amazon documentary .\n \n\n   \n  A DOJ award to the president would be the latest example of an administration increasingly willing to throw huge amounts of money at its pet projects while slashing government programs.  The Washington Post reported  last week that the Coast Guard plans to spend an estimated total of $200 million on two private jets to be used by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top officials. And Trump is planning a  $20 billion bailout of Argentina , conditional on voters supporting his populist friend and MAGA hero President Javier Milei.\n \n\n   \n  A huge Justice Department payout to Trump might top all that. But surely, given all the political liabilities and ethical nightmares, he wouldn’t go ahead.\n \n\n   \n  Or would he? Before this week, no one can have imagined that the wrecking-ball president would have demolished a beloved part of the White House, without consulting the people, the true owners of the home where he’s just a temporary resident.\n \n\n   \n  But the historic ghosts of elegant quarters once graced by Jacqueline Kennedy now lay buried in the  rubble of the East Wing , before Trump’s vast new ballroom rises — a kind of Mar-a-Lago on the Potomac.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/asia/myanmar-starlink-scam-centers-spacex-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:23:00Z","title":"SpaceX disables thousands of Starlink devices being used by Myanmar scam centers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink devices in Myanmar, targeting cyber scam centers along the border with Thailand that exploit vulnerable workers and use the internet to conduct massive fraud.

 \nUpdated: \n        1:23 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink devices being used by cyber scam syndicates operating in a lawless corner of Myanmar, the   Elon Musk-led company said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite regional authorities’ highly publicized  crackdowns on the cyberfraud centers  along Myanmar’s border with Thailand this year, the scamming networks have continued to proliferate in the civil war-afflicted nation.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX said it works to identify violations in all markets where Starlink operates.\n \n\n   \n  “On the rare occasion we identify a violation, we take appropriate action, including working with law enforcement agencies around the world,” said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX’s vice president of business operations for Starlink, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “In Myanmar, for example, SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected ‘scam centers’.”\n \n\n   \n  Dreyer did not provide a date for when the consoles were disabled, but the announcement comes after the Myanmar military junta said it discovered 30 sets of Starlink “receivers and accessories” during a raid on one such scam compound this week.\n \n\n   \n  There are about 30 sprawling, purpose-built compounds dotted along the Myanmar-Thai border that are dedicated to scamming victims, including Americans, out of billions of dollars every year, according to  a recent report  by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Workers in the scam centers are often lured by the promise of well-paid jobs,  or trafficked, and are routinely held against their will and forced to carry out online fraud schemes in the heavily guarded compounds, where former detainees have  previously told CNN  beatings and torture are common.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, concerns have been raised by the United States that criminal networks in Myanmar were using Starlink to access the internet and carry out their scams.\n \n\n   \n  Starlink has more than 6 million global users, according to its website. It provides high-speed internet service using a network of thousands of satellites at low-Earth orbit, enabling it to reach remote communities.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the news agency Agence France-Presse this month found that Starlink receivers had been installed on the roofs of the scam compounds at a “huge scale.”\n \n\n   \n  The US Congress Joint Economic Committee has begun an investigation into Starlink’s alleged involvement in the centers, according to the AFP investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The move by SpaceX comes as the global scam industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, with criminal groups adopting  artificial intelligence  and using online cryptocurrency markets to move vast amounts of stolen money undetected.\n \n\n   \n  Southeast Asia is a hotspot for these romance or investment scams known as “pig butchering,” named for the practice of fattening up prey before the slaughter. And Myanmar has become an attractive destination for the cybercrime networks, who are shielded by corruption and the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  Since taking power in a 2021 coup, the military administration – which does not control all of the country – has fought a civil war against a patchwork of anti-junta and regional ethnic groups.\n \n\n   \n  In February, Thailand  cut electricity supplies  to several areas in Myanmar that are home to the scam sites, to try and disrupt their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, about 7,000 workers and victims  were released  from scam centers along the border and repatriated in a major operation by Thai authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Between January 30 and October 19, Myanmar’s military junta said it had arrested 9,551 foreign nationals from the scam compounds, repatriating most of them.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have warned that represents a tiny fraction of people trapped and working in the centers.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Monday its raid on KK Park, a notorious scam compound near the country’s southeastern Myawaddy border town, uncovered more than 2,000 workers.\n \n\n   \n  Footage filmed for CNN from inside KK Park in April shows paved roads lined with trees and manicured lawns, giving the image of a legitimate business district, complete with a hotel and billboards advertising gambling sites.\n \n\n   \n  But a source who works in the anti-human-trafficking field told CNN the raid on KK Park has not stopped operations.\n \n\n   \n  While the impact of ceasing Starlink operations “is not nothing,” there were still “many victims trapped inside” other buildings of the compound   who “confirmed last night they’re still being forced to scam,” said the source.\n \n\n   \n  Transnational crime expert Jason Tower said the military raid on KK Park was “more of a publicity stunt than a crackdown” and that it was “business as usual” for dozens of scam compounds still operating along the Moei River that separates Myanmar and Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  “With international attention and outrage over Southeast Asia’s scamdemic rising, the Myanmar military is trying to skirt accountability for transforming the Myanmar-Thailand border lands into a hub for criminality,” said Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n \n\n   \n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations meets for a summit later this week in Malaysia, and the scourge of scam centers is likely to be a top issue on the agenda. “The military is also trying to position itself as continuing to take action on this issue,” Tower said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive  law enforcement operation  by the US and UK that recently targeted a Cambodian criminal scam network “likely pushed China to increase pressure once again on the Myanmar military regime to take further action,” Tower added.\n \n\n   \n  “It is also likely that the Myanmar military seeks to establish more direct control over some of the scam centers, as it realizes just how much illicit revenue is being brought in by this extremely lucrative form of criminal activity,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the military junta for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/us-military-strike-pacific-8th","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:46:00-04:00","title":"US military strikes 2 boats in Pacific in apparent expansion of campaign against alleged drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military has expanded its campaign against drug trafficking by conducting lethal strikes on two suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Eastern Pacific, killing all individuals on board.

boats in Pacific in apparent expansion of campaign against alleged drug trafficking \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Rashard Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:46 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military conducted lethal strikes against two boats in the eastern Pacific this week, killing all people on board each vessel, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The two strikes on vessels in the Pacific — the eighth and ninth known strikes by the US military on alleged drug-smuggling vessels since the start of September — appear to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, with all seven previous strikes targeting boats in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  At least 37 people in total have been killed in the nine strikes, officials have said.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said on X Wednesday, noting a Tuesday strike in the Pacific had killed both people on board.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said the boat in that strike was “being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific” and “was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route, and carrying narcotics.”\n \n\n   \n  Later Wednesday, Hegseth said the US conducted a lethal strike on a second suspected drug boat in the eastern Pacific, killing all three people on board.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO),” Hegseth wrote in  the post. \n \n\n   \n  The secretary added that no US forces were hurt in the two Pacific strikes and compared the traffickers to al Qaeda.\n \n\n   \n  “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people. There will be no refuge or forgiveness—only justice,” he wrote in his first post.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants who can be summarily killed without any kind of judicial review.\n \n\n   \n  The US struck at least two other vessels last week in the Caribbean, one of which did not kill everyone on board. Rather than hold  two survivors detained by the US Navy  after one of those strikes, the US  repatriated the survivors  back to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  The situation was potentially going to set up a legal and policy dilemma for the administration because it was unclear what legal authority the US military would be able to cite to detain them indefinitely.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/middleeast/analysis-trump-bibisitting-netanyahu-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Trump’s babysitting of Netanyahu puts the US in charge on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has taken a central role in managing the implementation of a Gaza ceasefire deal, shifting from mediation to active oversight.

    \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An American official called it “Bibi-sitting” – a revolving door of the highest-ranking members of the Trump administration to make sure Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , frequently known as “Bibi,” sticks to the US-brokered ceasefire deal.\n \n\n   \n  It flipped the narrative on a  decade-old campaign ad  in which Netanyahu was the “Bibi-sitter,” watching a couple’s children on a date night.\n \n\n   \n  Now it’s the US taking on that role, shuttling envoys, Cabinet members and even the president to ensure the implementation of the nascent Gaza ceasefire agreement.\n \n\n   \n  In short, the “Bibi-sitter” has become the babysat.\n \n\n   \n  In the span of just two weeks, an extraordinary parade of top US officials has descended on Israel in a diplomatic blitz.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump launched the charm offensive, visiting Israel last week to oversee the signing of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Then, on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance landed at Ben Gurion airport to monitor the deal’s implementation. On Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to arrive as well. Meanwhile, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff have conducted multiple missions to Israel, shaping and forging the agreement into a diplomatic reality.\n \n\n   \n  High-level American visits to Israel during times of crisis are not unprecedented – President Joe Biden rushed to Tel Aviv days after October 7, 2023, in a powerful solidarity visit, warning Israel’s enemies not to get involved, with his Secretary of State Antony Blinken following multiple times. But those visits were more about solidarity and deterrence; Trump’s are about management and compliance. This United States is not merely mediating the Gaza ceasefire – it is actively managing it.\n \n\n   \n  “We intend to stay engaged every single day to make sure peace takes hold,” Vance said at a news conference on Tuesday, unveiling a new US coordination center to monitor and assess real-time developments of the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n \n\n   \n  “The event is being managed by an external entity, by the Americans, and this is a very problematic matter,” former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen Gadi Eisenkot told Israel’s Kan Radio on Tuesday. “As we progress with the agreement, more international forces will enter, and this will limit the IDF.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington’s micromanagement of the deal’s implementation underscores its determination for the ceasefire to succeed. The Trump administration is spending an incredible amount of political capital to force the ceasefire to survive its first few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But it also reflects concern about the intent of Netanyahu’s political partners. His far-right allies have opposed an end to the war and called for a complete occupation of Gaza. Netanyahu was able to get the first phase of the deal through, including the return of the hostages in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n \n\n   \n  The second phase is far more challenging: defining post-war governance and security forces in Gaza, as well as establishing what roles the Palestinian Authority, Arab states and other international stakeholders will play.\n \n\n   \n  The fragility of the truce was exposed earlier this week, after a military clash in Rafah in which two Israeli soldiers were killed. Jerusalem was quick to declare this a ceasefire violation. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich tweeted one word: “War.” Israel carried out strikes across Gaza that killed more than 40 Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday afternoon, Netanyahu announced a suspension of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. But he reversed course two hours later under American pressure, according to an Israeli source with knowledge of the matter. Three days later, Vance said there would be “inevitable skirmishes,” but that the ceasefire would last.\n \n\n   \n  The post‑war phase also marks a recalibration of regional roles. Despite deep Israeli skepticism, Turkey and Qatar are central to Washington’s framework for reconstruction and mediation in Gaza. Vance stated pointedly in Jerusalem that “what troops are on the ground in Israel – or Gaza – is for Israelis to approve,” even as he praised Ankara and Doha for their “constructive” influence.\n \n\n   \n  “The rules of the game are being written while we speak, but it’s already clear that the US is calling the shots and Israel is playing by its rules,” Amos Harel, Haaretz’s senior military analyst, told CNN. “Netanyahu will never admit it, but to a large extent, Israel mortgaged some of its independence, with US generals controlling the wheel.”\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military is accustomed to incredibly close cooperation with the US, which has been on full display repeatedly throughout the war. But Harel says this is more than cooperation – it is management. “The Israeli military leadership does not necessarily like to have another authority hovering over their head,” he told CNN. But the military, whose chief of staff pushed to accept an earlier ceasefire, understands it’s the only way to end the war.\n \n\n   \n  “The US track, even if it’s full of holes, is the way to get there,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This dynamic is reflected in the Trump administration’s repeated interventions in Israel’s strategic decisions over the past several months. In June, Trump ordered the Israeli Air Force to recall jets en route to a strike on Iranian targets. In September, he forced an apology to Qatar after a failed strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Days later, he publicly instructed Israel to halt aerial operations in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  For some Israeli observers and politicians, the magnitude of American involvement could entrench the perception that Israel is dependent on US permission, eroding its sovereignty and freedom to apply force. “Netanyahu has single-handedly turned us into a protectorate, which accepts dictates regarding its security,” opposition leader Yair Lapid charged on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu rejected the criticism. Standing alongside Vance in Jerusalem on Wednesday, he said the idea that Israel is an American client state is “hogwash.”\n \n\n   \n  “One week they say Israel controls the US, a week later they say the US controls Israel,” he said sarcastically. Vance echoed his position, saying, “We don’t want a vassal state, and that’s not what Israel is. We don’t want a client state and that’s not what Israel is. We want a partnership, we want an ally here.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Trump and Netanyahu have repeatedly declared they intend to push the Middle East beyond conflict management toward a renewed Abraham Accords expansion. It is the carrot that Trump has dangled in front of Netanyahu, and the White House is trying its best to will it into existence.\n \n\n   \n  But the main Israeli political barrier persists: how to reconcile the demand for a viable pathway for Palestinian statehood with Netanyahu’s hardline coalition. Here, the American babysitting might play to Netanyahu’s advantage – Trump’s pressure can provide him with domestic political cover and an excuse for concessions his coalition would never otherwise accept.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/ncaa-college-athletes-pro-sports-betting","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:32:00-04:00","title":"NCAA Allows College Athletes to Bet on Professional Sports Starting November 1","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA has approved a rule change that permits college athletes and athletic department staff to place bets on professional sports, effective November 1, 2025.

Russia’s strategic nuclear forces carried out a readiness test supervised by the country’s President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, the Kremlin said.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, we are conducting a planned – I want to emphasize, planned – nuclear forces command and control exercise,” Putin said in a video conference with the top military brass.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s Ministry of Defense said the drills involved all three components of the nuclear triad: land, sea and air.\n \n\n   \n   Videos shared by the state-owned military TV channel Zvezda showed the launch of a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia’s north and a Sineva ballistic missile fired from the Bryansk nuclear-powered submarine in the Barents Sea.\n \n\n   \n  Tu-95MS long-range bombers also fired air-launched cruise missiles, the defense ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin said the drills tested the readiness of military command-and-control systems and the operational skills of the

Jeff Merkley now holds the record for third longest Senate floor speech in modern history, after delivering remarks for more than 22 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Merkley began speaking on the Senate floor after announcing he would protest what he called  President Donald Trump ’s “grave threats to democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We’re in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” the Oregon Democrat, who turns 69 on Friday, said after kicking off his remarks at 6:24 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  In total, the senator spoke for 22 hours and 36 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after his remarks came to an end, Merkley told CNN’s Manu Raju that he almost fainted at one point and noted that he had been dehydrating himself since Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “It is about dehydration. My last sip of anything — well, I might have had a micro-sip – was breakfast on Monday morning on the plane. That was my last food too. And I wasn’t really sure that was going to work out, and I said, ‘I hope I’m not fasting for no reason.’ I love to eat,” said Merkley, later adding that he had a slice of pizza just off the floor.\n \n\n   \n  He said “there was one moment” where he thought he might faint, and noted that he had injured his back while running a few weeks ago. “My back hurt the whole damn time,” said Merkley.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about gallery staff and Capitol Police, who are working without pay during the shutdown, being forced to work through the night during his speech, Merkley said it was “outrageous” that there are no negotiations happening to end the shutdown, and noted, “having this speech tonight or not having this tonight isn’t going to speed up paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added that after he finished speaking, “I went around and thanked everybody who had been on the floor, including the pages, including the floor staff, including everybody, because I do realize it was such an imposition.” He said that he also thanked the Republicans in the chair for presiding over his speech.\n \n\n   \n   Senate rules do not permit lawmakers to take bathroom breaks or sit down without yielding their time – though there was a short interruption Wednesday at noon for the daily prayer and pledge before the senator began speaking again.\n \n\n   \n  Merkley’s marathon speech stands as a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as his party remains in a standoff with Republicans over health care subsidies amid the government shutdown. The shutdown is expected to drag on with the impasse entering a fourth week Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have so far held their position, blocking the GOP stopgap bill to reopen the government 12 times until their demands are met.\n \n\n   \n  The senator in his speech pointed to the Trump administration’s previous  halting of research grants  for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the  recent indictments  of several of the president’s political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there’s a rebellion. And if there’s a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Early Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  His comments on the situation in Oregon come after  an appeals court  on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court’s permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Democratic  Sen. Cory Booker  of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, warning against the harms he said the administration was inflicting on the American public. The effort broke the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  This was also not Merkley’s first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017  against Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court .\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris  Murphy  on gun control in 2016;  Rand Paul  over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and  Ted Cruz  against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This headline and story have been updated to reflect the record held by Sen.

The president has shown visitors two flat tabletop models, at times quizzing the room on which version they preferred: the smaller one or the larger one. Most answered that the bigger one was better, to which Trump agreed.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s not clear how much larger, Trump did say Wednesday that the ballroom is expected to cost a projected $300 million, seemingly in line with a larger structure. Previously, the administration had  put the cost at $200 million .\n \n\n   \n  The project has  drawn outcry  and led to questions about whether the president was within his legal authority to dismantle entire sections of the executive mansion. Not all of Trump’s own team was set on the project at the start, one source familiar with the internal conversations told CNN. At the beginning, some aides and advisers thought it was too big of a task to undertake, and attempted to explain how difficult and lengthy the process was likely to be. But once it became clear the president wasn’t going to give up on the idea — which he’s been musing about for the better part of 15 years — everyone quickly got onboard.\n \n\n   \n  The White House says it will submit plans for the ballroom construction to the National Capital Planning Commission, but insists the body doesn’t have purview over the decision to knock down the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  Some former members of the panel have questioned that assessment. And one of the nation’s premier historic preservation organizations is calling for an immediate halt to the leveling of the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  But there appeared little standing in the way of the president’s decision to move ahead with the audacious, multi-year project. Now  the demolition  is well underway, it seemed unlikely the plans would be reversed.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure,” Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office when questioned about the project. A scale model of the White House grounds — with the ballroom prominently jutting out from the East Colonnade — sat on the table in front of him.\n \n\n   \n  He said after a “tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world,” the determination was made of the East Wing that “really knocking it down” would be necessary.\n \n\n   \n  “It was never thought of as being much,” he said. “It was a very small building.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, track excavators continued their work ripping into the former home of the office of the first lady, the White House calligrapher and some military aides. The demolition was proceeding quickly, with roughly half the structure now reduced to a grey pile of cement and twisted rebar. Staffers in those departments have been relocated to other areas on the complex.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing’s wood-paneled foyer has long been the main point of entry for visitors attending social events at the White House, as well as those going on tours of the building. The section emerged in its current form in 1942.\n \n\n   \n  The rest of the East Wing is likely to be demolished by the end of the week, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways, the cries of disapproval are coming too late. Renderings released by the White House in July showed the ballroom sitting atop where the East Wing used to sit, and an  official press release  at the time stated it would sit “where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said anyone outraged or concerned he was taking steps without being frank about his intentions were misplaced.\n \n\n   \n  “I haven’t been transparent? I’ve shown this to everybody that would listen,” he said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Still, images of the building torn to pieces this week have caused shock, particularly as Trump tests his authority in nearly all aspects of the presidency — not least of which is the building he lives and works in.\n \n\n   \n  The project began ramping up over the summer, one source said, and weekly meetings to discuss the project began. The president himself has been involved in these meetings, which also have included Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, the White House Military Office, the Secret Service, an architecture team and other staffers internally who have been tasked with helping move the project along quickly, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House said in late July that McCrery Architects and its CEO James McCrery would take the lead in the design of the addition. A few days later, McCrery was spotted alongside Trump on the White House roof surveying the area on the South Grounds where the ballroom will go.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s aides were prepared for pushback on the ballroom and sought to review what was legally required to complete the project, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, administration officials determined the White House would only need approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal construction projects in Washington and its neighboring states, Virginia and Maryland. But officials said the commission has jurisdiction only when “vertical” construction begins, and does not oversee demolition.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently  appointed White House staff secretary and loyalist Will Scharf to chair the commission . White House deputy Chief of Staff James Blair and another Trump aide were also appointed to the commission at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  Scharf said during a meeting of the commission last month the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The commission, which is closed amid the ongoing government shutdown, was created by Congress in 1924 and is comprised of 12 members. Three are appointed by the president, along with the chairman, with the rest of the seats reserved for federal agencies, such as the National Park Service, and representatives from the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  Projects reviewed by the NCPC in recent years include changing the perimeter fence around the White House grounds and a tennis pavilion Trump installed during his first term. The fence, in particular, took several years before it was ultimately approved; officials said it was a necessary change because people kept jumping over the previous one and running toward the North Portico.\n \n\n   \n  L. Preston Bryant Jr., who served as chairman of the NCPC for nearly a decade, described a three-stage process that typically unfolds for federal projects, beginning with early consultations that he described as collaborative.\n \n\n   \n  “The Commission staff very much wants a potential project to get started on the right foot. This early consultation stage is very important,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The project goes through subsequent phases — conceptional, preliminary approval and final approval — before the process is complete.\n \n\n   \n  Bryant said he couldn’t remember a time when demolition was separated from the approval process in the way the Trump White House has done.\n \n\n   \n  “That was not my experience during my time at NCPC,” Bryant said. “If there’s to be demolition, that’s part of the project. The demolition element is inherent in the overall project. Demo is not separated from construction. It’s part of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Rebecca Miller, the executive director of the DC Preservation League, said demolishing the East Wing before a formal submission of the ballroom plans essentially starts the project before a formal review process.\n \n\n   \n  “Most concerning is that they’re just tearing down the East Wing without any public submission as to what is going to be built in its place,” she said. “And that’s where the National Capital Planning Commission, or the Commission on Fine Arts, or the public, would have their input into the design of the property, its compatibility with the White House, and how to mitigate or minimize the impact on the current historic resource.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this kind of zone where there’s nothing that prevents the demolition, but we’ve also not seen what the submission is,” Miller added.\n \n\n   \n  Other laws and rules also appear not to apply to the White House. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the  National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 , which details the process by which stakeholders should be brought in for large public projects. But the law excludes the three pillars of US government – the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the White House — from its provisions.\n \n\n   \n  The  Shipstead-Luce Act of 1930  also requires that alterations to buildings in the national capital area, including the White House, must be presented to the Commission of Fine Arts. The language, however, refers to buildings facing the White House and not the White House itself.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the concerns about the new ballroom appear unconvincing. Sitting in the newly gilded Oval Office as the machines were working away outside, he held up a pile of paper renderings showing the plans, including the Louis XIV-style interior that closely resembles the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “You see it goes beautifully with the White House,” Trump proclaimed. “I mean, the mix is beautiful.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/americas/caribbean-strike-survivor-ecuador-drug-smuggling-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"19:55:00-04:00","title":"He survived a US military boat strike.

Despite a drug record, his family says he’s a fisherman caught in Trump’s war at sea \n       \n  By David Culver, Abel Alvarado, Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:55 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The last time Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila’s sister heard from   him was about a year ago when he told her he was heading out to fish for work, she said. Last week, she was shocked to learn that her brother was aboard an alleged drug vessel that was struck by the US military.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila, 41, was one of two people who survived last week’s  strike  in the Caribbean, which President Donald Trump said was carried out against a “drug-carrying submarine” navigating toward the United States. Two others were killed.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila and the other survivor were later returned by the US to their countries of origin, Trump said, describing them as “terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  “No, no … He’s not. He’s not a criminal,” Tufiño Chila’s sister, who asked for her name to not be published out of fear for her safety, told CNN from a small coastal town two hours from the Ecuadorian port city of Guayaquil.\n \n\n   \n  She claims to know nothing of her brother’s alleged involvement with drug trafficking and instead portrayed him as a desperate father trying to provide for his six kids. Tufiño Chila’s wife left him and took the children, but he still sent them money, his sister said.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s very happy, fun,” she said of her brother. “He’s everything I loved most.”\n \n\n   \n  She still hasn’t heard from her brother since he was released by Ecuadorian authorities this week after returning home.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s Attorney General’s Office said Monday that authorities have no information that Tufiño Chila committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. But he has a criminal record in the US: Court documents show that he was arrested, convicted and jailed in 2020 for smuggling drugs off Mexico’s coast before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila’s sister said two other brothers were arrested months earlier, also on drug smuggling charges. Both are in custody: one is in the US, the other is in Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n    Pacific transit route\n \n\n   \n  The family’s   experience illustrates how Ecuador has become a critical route in the cocaine trade. About 70% of the world’s cocaine supply passes from Colombia and Peru through its shores, Ecuador’s president says.\n \n\n   \n  Drug runners often transport narcotics through a large stretch of water on the Pacific Ocean and drop them off in Mexico, where they’re subsequently smuggled  into the US  or Europe.\n \n\n   \n  The drug trafficking trade is hard to escape in Tufiño Chila’s town, according to those who live there.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is complicated. It’s hard,” one man tells CNN of fishermen’s financial struggles, where monthly wages can be as little as $100.\n \n\n   \n  Becoming a drug runner is an enticing prospect when one can make tens of thousands of dollars up front, according to another fisherman who spoke to CNN in March from  Manta , an Ecuadorian city on the Pacific coast.\n \n\n   \n  The profession has also found itself at the crosshairs of the Trump administration. On Tuesday, the  US expanded  its military campaign of attacking boats it suspected of illegal drug running, hitting a vessel in the eastern Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  Both people on board were killed, according to US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  It was the eighth known strike by the US military on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the start of September. All seven previous strikes had targeted boats in the Caribbean Sea, just north of Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  To date, at least 34 people have been killed in the US strikes – 32 of them in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration says they’re about saving American lives from drug overdoses. But most US overdose deaths aren’t from cocaine. They’re from  fentanyl , largely produced in Mexico and smuggled over the border by land, often by US citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As the US strikes continue, the ones caught in the crossfire are rarely cartel leaders, but the men who  take the risk for them . They’re fishermen often seen as expendable by the gangs that hire them.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila’s sister showed CNN around the house where they lived before her brother went away. His room is kept like a shrine, with a lit candle to honor him and his clothes folded neatly on his bed.\n \n\n   \n  She hopes to speak with her brother soon. For now, she takes comfort in knowing he’s alive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/tesla-earnings","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"19:30:00-04:00","title":"Tesla’s Best Quarter Isn’t Enough to Impress Investors","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite recording a record of nearly 500,000 vehicle sales in its third quarter of 2025, Tesla’s profit declined sharply—adjusted income down 29% and net income down 37%—due to the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit and the elimination of regulatory credit sales by the Trump administration.

Because they know it won’t last \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:30 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  You’d think after a tumultuous year for Elon Musk’s car company, Wall Street would be cheering Tesla’s record quarterly sales. They’re not.\n \n\n   \n  That’s for two main reasons: First, Tesla’s profit fell from a year ago and missed analysts’ estimates.\n \n\n   \n  Second, Tesla’s sales were largely booming last quarter because customers scrambled to nab electric cars before a US tax credit expired.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of Tesla ( TSLA ) fell 2% in after-market trading following the report, but ahead of a call for investors scheduled for 5:30 pm ET.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla has a difficult road ahead, and investors know that. The ones still cheering and buying Tesla shares are those who aren’t focused on car sales. Instead, they believe in Musk’s promise of a future based on self-driving cars and robotics.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, neither Musk nor CFO Vaibhav Taneja spent significant time talking about car sales or profits during an hour-long call with investors and analysts on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Instead they spent most of the time talking about the promise of self-driving vehicles, robotaxis and humanoid robots, without much insight on when those thing will contribute to Tesla’s bottom line.\n \n\n   \n  Judging by after-market stock trading, investors were not impressed. Shares were down a bit less than 2% as the call got underway but fell steadily during the first half, hitting a low of down   about 5%. While shares climbed back, they were still down more than 3% when the hour concluded.\n \n\n   \n  As for the barely discussed financial results, the company earned adjusted income of $1.8 billion in the third quarter, down 29% from a year ago. That was a slightly bigger drop in earnings than analysts had forecast, and net income tumbled 37%.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the earnings miss, it was still the company’s best quarter so far this year.\n \n\n   \n  The drop in earnings came even after Tesla reported  record sales  of nearly 500,000 cars during the quarter, as Americans rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  But electric vehicle sales in the US are widely expected to plunge in the fourth quarter. That’s because people who would have normally bought EVs later in the year flocked to buy cars early to lock in the tax break. The loss of the tax credit is expected to hurt demand among American buyers going forward. Tesla gets nearly half of its revenue from US customers.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla is also facing increased competition for EV sales globally, particularly from Chinese automakers. Those automakers not only dominate their own domestic market, but are also moving into Europe. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs this year, despite the fact that it does not sell any cars in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla sales worldwide fell 13% during the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier both due to increased competition, as well as backlash to Musk’s political activity.\n \n\n   \n    Drop in key source of profits\n \n\n   \n  But the removal of the EV tax credit is only part of Tesla’s problem. The Trump administration also eliminated what has been a key profit driver throughout the company’s history – the  sale of regulatory credits .\n \n\n   \n  In years past, the federal government set emissions limits on the total greenhouse gases that came out of all the cars a company sold in a given year. If a car company sold too many gas-guzzling pickups, as opposed to economical hatchbacks or cars with no emissions at all, it would have to buy “credits” from companies like Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration’s massive tax and spending bill passed in July eliminated the federal penalties for violating emissions rules, and thus the need for automakers to buy regulatory credits.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the change in the law, the company still reported $417 million in regulatory credit sales in the third quarter. But that was $322 million less than a year ago, and the revenue loss caused a direct hit to the company’s bottom line. CFO Taneja did say the company entered into new regulatory credit contracts in the quarter, but did not give any details on those contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Regulatory credit sales have brought in $11.4 billion for Tesla since 2019. Sometimes they were   the only thing keeping the company profitable at all – including in the first three months of this year.\n \n\n   \n    Robots and robotaxis\n \n\n   \n  Tesla launched the company’s long-promised  robotaxi  offering with limited service in late June, with Musk promising much grander things to come.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Musk said he thinks the robotaxi service would be operating in eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. But that’s a long step back from the last earnings call in July ,  when he said the service would be available to half the US population by the year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  Musk said Tesla is still set to start production of the Cybercab, a vehicle for the robotaxi service that does not have a steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, by the second quarter next year. ﻿But the service now requires has a human safety driver sitting in the driver’s seat during each ride.\n \n\n   \n  “So so our goal is to be actually paranoid about deployment because obviously even one accident will be frontpage headline news worldwide,” he said. “So it’s better for us to take a cautious approach here. But we do expect to have no safety drivers in the car in Austin… within a few months.”\n \n\n   \n  It also said production lines for the first generation of its planned Optimus humanoid robots are being installed in anticipation of volume production. But it did not give details of when production might begin.\n \n\n   \n    Vote on Musk’s $1 trillion pay package\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s call was also Musk’s first time talking to investors since the company unveiled a new proposed pay package for the CEO, which could award him stock worth  $1 trillion . Shareholders are set to vote on that pay package at Tesla’s annual meeting next month. CFO Taneja took time at the end of the call to urge shareholders to support the pay package.\n \n\n   \n  Musk didn’t get into much detail about the compensation package, characterizing it as necessary for him to be able to keep control of the company.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” he said. “It’s just, you know, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?”\n \n\n   \n  “I just think that there needs to be enough voting control to give us strong influence,” he said near the end of the call, “but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/us/sonya-massey-shooting-trial-sean-grayson","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:48:00-05:00","title":"Sheriff’s Deputy ‘Got Mad’ and Fatally Shot Sonya Massey Without Justification, Prosecutor Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson, a white man, fatally shot 36-year-old Black woman Sonya Massey in her Springfield, Illinois home on July 6, 2024, during a confrontation over a pot of hot water she had removed from the stove.

\nUpdated: \n        6:48 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The Illinois sheriff’s deputy who killed  Sonya Massey  in her Springfield home last year eschewed his training and the principles of policing when he shot the Black woman who had called 911 for help, a prosecutor said Wednesday in Sean Grayson’s murder trial.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, who is white, faces three counts of first-degree murder for  shooting the 36-year-old single mother  on July 6, 2024, during a confrontation over her handling of a pot of hot water she removed from her stove.\n \n\n   \n  The jury watched unedited  body camera video  of the encounter, prompting some jurors to recoil and cover their mouths while Grayson looked down for much of it. Massey’s mother left the courtroom in tears.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser told the jury that the video would show Massey posed no threat when Grayson and fellow Sangamon County Sheriff’s Deputy Dawson Farley entered her home. Massey, who had mental health problems, had called 911 about a suspected prowler.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s a little scattered, but she’s nice and kind and talking to him and you’ll see that interaction,” Milhiser said during opening statements. “You will see what happens when the defendant gets mad at a woman who is in her kitchen and has called for help. He gets mad and shoots and kills her without lawful justification.”\n \n\n   \n  “He did not follow his training. He did not follow police principles.”\n \n\n   \n  Grayson’s attorney, Daniel Fultz, told the jury that when Massey approached with the pot of water, Grayson repeatedly demanded she put it down before “making a decision no police officer wants to make.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Massey lifted the pot of water above her head and the evidence will show that the use of force was reasonable under the circumstances without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight,” Fultz said. “What happened to Ms. Massey was a tragedy, but it was not a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  The killing has prompted continued questions about US law enforcement shootings of  Black people in their home s  and generated a change in  Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, 31, has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of murder, he faces 45 years to life in prison. Prosecutors dismissed single counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and Farley had entered Massey’s home to report they had found no suspicious activity when Grayson noticed the pan on the stove and ordered it removed.\n \n\n   \n  The body camera video shows Grayson and Massey joking about how the deputy backed away as she moved the pot before Massey said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Grayson later told sheriff’s investigators he thought Massey’s statement  meant she intended to kill him . He yelled at her to drop the pot. In the subsequent commotion, he fired three shots,  striking her just below the eye .\n \n\n   \n  Farley testified that he drew his weapon after Grayson did because department policy calls for a deputy to do so when a partner does.\n \n\n   \n  “She just never did or said anything that made me think she was a threat,” Farley said. “Looking across the room and seeing my partner draw his gun — it was the defendant’s actions that made me have a heightened sense of awareness.”\n \n\n   \n  Under Fultz’s questioning, Farley acknowledged that his initial report days after the shooting claimed he feared for his safety from the hot water and that Massey held the pot chest high. Farley said that after Grayson was indicted he sought to amend his statement to the Illinois State Police to “clarify” that it was Grayson’s response, not the hot water, that rattled him and that it was an oven mitt, not the pot, that Massey held chest-high.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Farley was serving a one-year probationary period and subject to firing for any reason. He said his union representative advised against further state police contact.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Illinois State Police Lt. Eric Weston, a crime scene investigator, told defense attorney Mark Wykoff that he collected two shell casings from Grayson’s 9 mm pistol at Massey’s home the morning of the shooting. The third casing was picked up days later, when he learned three shots had been fired. But the pot sat untouched in the house for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “You knew an hour after the event occurred that the pot was basically employed as a weapon, but you didn’t collect it then,” Wykoff said. “You didn’t collect it during the second search when the third cartridge was collected. You collected it about two weeks later.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/cars/gm-self-driving-tech","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:58:00Z","title":"GM to Introduce 'Eyes-Off' Driving in 2028","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"General Motors, the 100-year-old automaker, is set to introduce 'eyes-off' driving technology in its Cadillac Escalade IQ SUV starting in 2028, featuring hands-free driving and conversational AI that allows users to watch movies, work, or manage daily tasks.

 Source: CNN\n \n   \n  General Motors, the 100-year-old car company that has struggled with its expensive modernization efforts, plans to offer Americans hands-free driving and the freedom to watch a movie on the go.\n \n\n   \n  The company unveiled new “eyes-off” driving technology that will be available starting in 2028, part of a new technology initiative revealed by GM executives in New York Wednesday. The automaker said the initiative includes a conversational AI technology that will be introduced into   vehicles next year.\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine you step into your vehicle, you push a button, and it drives you to the office. You catch up on work, send emails, or watch an episode of your favorite show,”   said GM CEO Mary Barra. “The car drops you off … then it goes to get your dry cleaning, take out for dinner, and it comes back in time so you can drive your kids to their soccer game.”\n \n\n   \n  The version of the future imagined and described by Barra is years away, but in three years GM is promising the “eyes-off” driving experience will be available in their Cadillac Escalade IQ SUV.\n \n\n   \n  This year GM will take a $1.6 billion hit to their electric vehicle business because of government policy changes and the termination of consumer EV tax credits. GM has poured tens of billions of dollars into their EV fleets but has struggled attracting like-minded consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “Customers want immersive tech in their vehicles and to stay connected wherever they go. We’re drawing from our rich heritage, our design, our engineering, our manufacturing expertise, and we’re doing something entirely new,” said Barra.\n \n\n   \n  This technology may be new for General Motors, but it’s far from the first car company to release this type of tech. Stellantis, Tesla, and Waymo already have driverless cars on the road. (Stellantis – along with Mercedes and Volkswagen – also have conversational AI capabilities.)\n \n\n   \n  No company has yet achieved wide-scale commercialization of self-driving cars, so GM believes an opportunity for leadership still exists. But it has a tremendous amount of ground to make up.\n \n\n   \n  “When we launch this, we’ll see what happens. We may be the first to have a personally owned self-driving vehicle that works, that’s safe and that’s important. I don’t view it as catchup. I view it as leapfrog,” said Sterling Anderson, Chief Product Officer at GM.\n \n\n   \n  Barra and GM’s President Mark Reuss, who both began their careers at General Motors in the 1980’s, presided over Wednesday’s unveiling. They were joined by Anderson, who started six months ago and previously worked at Tesla, and Dave Richardson, the company’s SVP of Software Engineering, who joined almost two years ago from Apple.\n \n\n   \n  “The juxtaposition on stage is not an accident, (it’s) stark,” Anderson said of his Tesla background.\n \n\n   \n  Both hirings reflect that General Motors – the car company – must be a technology-first company to compete.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just sort of a recognition that the company does need to get more technology forward and focused. But that just takes a little bit of time for people to get on the same page,” Richardson said.\n \n\n   \n  Time is not on GM’s side. Cars from Chinese companies like BYD and Zeekr are rapidly gaining market share in Europe due to their lower prices and technology-forward designs. A 100% US tariff on Chinese cars has kept them out of the US market.\n \n\n   \n  But if that changes, those companies could present a real challenge for GM. But Reuss thinks GMs offerings can compete.\n \n\n   \n   “It’s not going to be taking apart Chinese cars and copying Chinese cars,” said Reuss. ”We went through technology investment and R&D and we’ll continue to do that and we have got to be the best, period. I think that wins with the customer.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/federal-law-enforcement-employees-not-paid-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:25:00-04:00","title":"Dissension in the ranks: Some, but not all, federal law enforcement employees are getting paychecks this week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown, the Trump administration issued paychecks to only certain federal law enforcement employees—specifically criminal investigative agents categorized as 1811 employees—such as FBI agents, BATFE agents, and U.S. Secret Service personnel.

The Trump administration’s move to issue paychecks this week to some but not all federal law enforcement employees during the government shutdown is sowing division in the ranks and does little to resolve the harm being done to ongoing investigations, current and former law enforcement officials tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under special accommodations from the Trump administration, agencies are providing paychecks on schedule to criminal investigative agents, including those who work for Justice Department agencies such as the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and at the US Secret Service, which is part of the Homeland Security department.\n \n\n   \n  But intelligence analysts and support staff at those agencies won’t be receiving their paychecks during the shutdown. The administration is limiting the paychecks to those categorized as 1811 employees, a reference to the code used for the White House’s budget office for criminal investigative agents.\n \n\n   \n  “You can imagine what that is doing to morale,” one current senior federal law enforcement official told CNN. “Our intelligence analysts are doing crucial work; without them cases don’t get made. So, to do this doesn’t send the right message.”\n \n\n   \n  Dan Brunner, a retired FBI agent who worked through a previous government shutdown says that paying only agents and not analysts and other staff will damage morale.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact is that analysts and professional staff all play a vital role in the entire FBI investigations. That’s why they have to continue working because they have an integral part. Every single person not just 1811s play a crucial role in the lifespan of an investigation,” Brunner said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House hasn’t said how they’re funding the paychecks for these criminal investigative agents.\n \n\n   \n  The impact is made worse because during the shutdown, investigators are limited in spending money on certain investigative activities.\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI can’t pay informants, they can’t do drug buys, they can’t travel. There’s no money. It’s not just the pay, it affects investigations. It stalls them,” Brunner said.\n \n\n   \n  At the FBI, employees were told last week that the bureau would pay agents for at least the next two paychecks, while other employees would not be paid during the shutdown. What’s more, agents will get not only their regular salaries but also the extra incentive pay that they receive on top of their salary for being available for unscheduled duty.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s really pissing people off,” one employee told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI Agents Association thanks President Donald Trump for ensuring special agents are paid, noting it “reflects the essential role FBI Agents play in protecting the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  The association added: “The FBI’s success, however, depends on more than its Agents. Analysts, professional staff, and other personnel — who continue to work without pay — play a vital role in confronting threats from terrorism and cyberattacks to violent crime and corruption.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN in a statement Wednesday that it is “actively pursuing options to pay all employees during the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n   “The FBI is made up of special agents, intelligence analysts, technical experts, and support personnel – all of whom are critical to our mission of defending the homeland and protecting the American people,” the statement said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/beef-argentina-republicans-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:35:00Z","title":"GOP Pushback Grows Over Trump’s Call to Buy Beef from Argentina","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has proposed a deal to buy beef from Argentina in an effort to lower consumer prices, a move that has sparked significant backlash from American farmers and ranchers.

grows over Trump’s call to buy beef from Argentina \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:35 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Todd Armstrong, the owner of a 200-year-old family cattle and crops farm in Indiana, voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 but feels abandoned by the president now for suggesting  a deal  for the US to buy beef from Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  “What frustrates me about this whole move is President Trump ran on an ‘America First’ program. I don’t see anything in this that puts America first,” Armstrong told CNN. “It’s hypocritical.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s stories from farmers like Armstrong that have come into Rep. Erin Houchin’s office.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve heard concerns from constituents,” Houchin, a Republican, said in a statement to CNN. “For now, this remains only a suggestion from President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  And it has Republicans on Capitol Hill frantically raising alarm bells with the White House and even the president directly. The potential for such a move is testing the support of one of Trump’s most loyal group of supporters as his policies could risk their livelihoods. The unfolding episode also marks a rare moment on Capitol Hill where many Republicans are publicly breaking with the president and demanding he reverse course.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a topic that has dominated the conversation with Trump — from Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, who told CNN he has spoken “extensively” to the president on the issu, on down to freshmen like Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana. And the issue was raised by GOP senators in a private meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday.   \n \n\n   \n  “What we’re hearing from Montana ranchers and American ranchers and farmers generally is, ‘Give us a chance to do this with American products, with American producers first, before we turn to foreign markets’,” Sheehy told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A handful of House Republicans led by GOP Rep. Julie Fedorchak of North Dakota also sent a letter directly to Trump asking for more details and clarity.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson shared that House Republicans raised concerns about the Argentina beef proposal on their private call Tuesday and said GOP Rep. Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, who represents a lot of cattle ranchers, has been connected with administration officials and the office of the United States trade representative.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re having those thoughtful discussions,” Johnson said at a press conference Wednesday. “The White House doesn’t want any unintended consequences. What they’re trying to do is improve the lives of everyday Americans, make our economy work again, and make sure that we are treated fairly by trading partners around the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The concerns from prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill come after Trump recently suggested he’s considering a deal to purchase beef from the economically struggling Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  “We would buy some beef from Argentina. If we do that, that will bring our beef prices down,” Trump said. “The one thing that’s kept up is beef. And if we buy some beef, I’m not talking about that much from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country.”\n \n\n   \n  The president of the US Cattlemen’s Association, Justin Tupper, told CNN his phone has been ringing off the hook from cattle ranchers across the country since Trump floated the idea on Sunday. He’s spoken with Thune’s staff and has sent a letter to the president requesting a meeting to urge him not to buy more beef from Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  American farmers have been having a tough year in no small part because of Trump’s trade war. Farmers across the country have been  issuing increasingly urgent warnings  that they’ll face grim consequences if they don’t get help selling this year’s bumper crop that many have begun harvesting. The White House is  gearing up  to extend farmers a multi-billion-dollar bailout, but that has yet to materialize. And farmers are warning that Trump’s idea of buying Argentinian beef to try and lower consumer prices could make matters worse.\n \n\n   \n  “Beef cattle were the only thing that’s keeping us afloat. If the prices drop, it’s going to affect us right now. It’s going to affect generations to come,” Randy Roberts, a beef and crop producer in Indiana, told CNN. “It will be hard for younger generations to get into the cattle business.”\n \n\n   \n  Even as criticisms from Republicans to the idea of the US buying Argentinian beef are pouring in, some are hopeful that the idea ultimately does not come to fruition.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska, who represents a significant number of cattle feeding operations in his district, said he has been told by Trump administration officials that the president is being briefed on the issue and taking it seriously.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hesitant to suggest this is anything but a blip on the radar because there’s no real identified plan,” Flood told CNN. “That said it is something we are paying very close attention to, and I am going to work every day on behalf of Nebraska farmers and ranchers. I prioritize Nebraska farmers and ranchers. I will stand up for farmers and ranchers. Right now, I’m expressing concern about anything that’s disrupting our beef market in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Already, the pushback to the administration’s proposal online has been fierce.\n \n\n   \n  Meriwether Farms, a Wyoming based beef company, called Trump out directly in a  social media post .\n \n\n   \n  “Dear @POTUS Trump, we love you and support you— but your suggestion to buy beef from Argentina to stabilize beef prices would be an absolute betrayal to the American cattle rancher,” the post reads.\n \n\n   \n  The blowback mounted quickly after Trump floated the idea for a deal to purchase beef from Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Even amid growing opposition, the president appeared to double down on his position Wednesday, posting on Truth Social that cattle ranchers don’t understand why they are “doing so well,” citing his tariff policy.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” Trump posted.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the day, the president argued again that his administration’s tariff policies have greatly benefited US cattle ranchers.\n \n\n   \n  “I helped them a lot,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “I put tariffs on things coming in to the country, including beef, and that gave them a chance to finally have a decent industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The president added that he’s now trying to balance aiding the industry with bringing down consumer beef prices.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been able to have an industry, but I also want to keep the beef prices low,” Trump said. “We’re going to do something very quickly and easily on beef to get it down.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump is planning to speak with ranchers about the initiative, he said, though he didn’t specify which groups within the beef industry he planned to hear from.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-republicans-redistricting-battle-map-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00-20:31","title":"North Carolina legislature gives final approval to new congressional map that could give GOP one more seat in US House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Carolina's legislature has approved a new congressional map that aims to secure an additional Republican seat in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Members of the public were escorted out of the chamber after protests broke out shortly before the vote.\n \n\n   \n  State law does not give Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.\n \n\n   \n  Stein on Wednesday called the move a “disgraceful” abuse of power.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re afraid that they will lose in the midterms and afraid to say no to the president. So, they’ve turned their backs on you to silence your vote in the 2026 election. It’s outrageous,” Stein said in a video message posted after the vote. “When a candidate or a party loses an election, you’re supposed to work like hell to connect better with voters so that you can win the next time. You do not rig the rules of the game to guarantee your victory, the voters be damned.”\n \n\n   \n  The new map targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines are explicitly drawn to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina. Under the map used in last year’s elections, Republicans control 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  “While families in eastern North Carolina face real struggles and concerns, our state has prioritized passing a new congressional map that affects only our region, with the intention of predetermining the outcome of an election 377 days away,” said Davis in a statement released Wednesday evening. “It is not only one of the darkest moments in our state’s history, but the way it was done—offering limited public participation by those affected and ignoring the voices of those who did participate—is morally wrong on all fronts. Still, I remain committed to ensuring every voice in eastern North Carolina is heard, no matter how the lines are drawn.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now here we are in North Carolina, doing a fifth redistricting in five years. It’s not because of the census. It’s not because of a court order. It’s because of a command from a president. Unprecedented in U.S. history,” state Rep. Marcia Morey, a Democrat from Durham, noted, calling the process “map warfare.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans acknowledged the motivation behind the new map was helping President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Please support this legal proposal to help North Carolina help President Donald J. Trump make America great again,” said Rep. Jimmy Dixon from Warsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The final vote came just two days after Republican lawmakers, who control North Carolina’s legislature, formally opened debate on the map.\n \n\n   \n  The state joined  Texas  and  Missouri  in drawing new lines to benefit the GOP, bringing to seven the total number of new Republican-friendly districts created this year.\n \n\n   \n  The Tar Heel State was the latest state to begin work on a once-rare, mid-decade redistricting. The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip just a handful of seats to take control of the House after next year’s congressional elections.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican who helped oversee the map-drawing, described the high stakes in stark terms.\n \n\n   \n  “The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular: draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the congressional delegation,” he said. If Democrats take control of the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” Hise added.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans in North Carolina acted swiftly to accede to Trump’s wishes. State lawmakers held the first open meeting about the new map on Monday morning and approved it in the state Senate the following day – despite sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the public who showed up at the state Capitol in Raleigh to protest the move.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is a politically competitive state. And Democrats such as Stein and his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, have captured statewide offices in recent election cycles. But Republican leaders this week framed the lopsided congressional map as an outcome Trump deserved given his electoral success in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times,” the state Sen. Phil Berger, the top Republican in the Senate, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    State-by-state battle\n \n\n   \n  Legislators in deep-red Texas kicked off the political arms race this year with a  map that seeks to send five more Republicans  to Congress. Missouri Republicans also have drawn new lines aimed at adding  an additional GOP member  to the state’s congressional delegation. Both face court challenges, and activists in Missouri are seeking to overturn the map through a petition drive.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the biggest pushback from Democrats comes from  California, which launched a redistricting effort in response to Texas . A multimillion-dollar advertising and get-out-the vote campaign now is underway to persuade voters to temporarily override congressional maps drawn by an independent commission next month and create as many as five new US House seats for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have a clear advantage over Democrats in the number of states that could redraw maps. The GOP holds control of the governor’s office and both chambers of the legislature in 23 states, compared to Democrats’ 15.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in other Republican states also are contemplating new maps, including Kansas, where legislators have  approved  $460,000 to fund a special session that would target the lone Democrat representing the state in Washington, four-term Rep. Sharice Davids. Two-thirds of the state House and Senate must agree to call a special session.\n \n\n   \n  In Indiana, where Republicans hold a 7-2 edge in the US House, the White House has repeatedly urged the GOP lawmakers in the majority in the state legislature to target at least one of the Democratic-held seats. Vice President JD Vance has twice visited the state to lobby legislators.\n \n\n   \n  Two other Republican-controlled states, Ohio and Utah, also are in throes of redistricting battles that began before Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  In Utah, a judge found that an existing map hadn’t followed guidelines imposed by a citizen ballot measure. Earlier this month, the GOP-dominated legislature passed a new congressional map that could give Democrats a slim chance of breaking the GOP’s monopoly on the state’s congressional delegation.\n \n\n   \n  That map needs to go back before the judge for her approval, with a final decision expected in early November. At the same time, Republicans in the state have launched a signature-gathering petition in the hopes of blocking the new map.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, the redrawing of its congressional districts is an outgrowth of a state law that requires maps approved without bipartisan support be redrawn after four years. Crafting new maps will ultimately fall to the Republican-controlled General Assembly, likely next month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are vowing to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrat in the US House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is weighing an effort to counter Republicans in Ohio. If the map is passed along partisan lines, state law allows a voter referendum that could invalidate the map, and Jeffries is prepared to go all-in to support that effort — including raising money, according to a person familiar with his planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose internal deliberations.\n \n\n   \n  John Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Democrats will mount lawsuits, protests and citizen-led ballot initiatives to push back on the actions in GOP-dominated states.\n \n\n   \n  “Republicans are openly stating that they need to take away the voting power of the American people through gerrymandering in order to win the 2026 midterms,” Bisognano said in a statement. “That alone is a sign of incredible weakness. The fact that they are taking the gerrymandering crisis to even more states beyond Texas and Missouri underscores just how scared they are of the opposition they are facing from the American people – even in deep red states.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic fury in North Carolina\n \n\n   \n  Trump has praised the new lines, writing last week on Truth Social that it “would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ district representing a swath of eastern North Carolina is the only competitive US House seat remaining in North Carolina after previous rounds of redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump won the district last November even as Davis won a second term by less than two percentage points. The new map makes the district more favorable to Republicans by swapping out several counties with more conservative communities on the coast.\n \n\n   \n  Some North Carolina Republicans argued that actions in California – and other deep-blue states – required them to respond. “This is a political arms race that Republicans did not start,” Hise said, pointing for former President  Barack Obama ’s support of the California redistricting initiative.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic state lawmakers along with multiple members of the public who spoke during the elections committee meeting denounced the map as a brazen power grab.\n \n\n   \n  “California hasn’t redistricted a thing,” Mark Swallow of Democracy Out Loud, a liberal activist group, said during the public comment period in a Senate committee meeting. “What they’ve done is respond to Texas, which started this fiasco for our country, and put an initiative on the ballot to ask Californians if they should be redistricted.”\n \n\n   \n  “You should do the same,” he told legislators, “but I doubt that you will because you know that North Carolinians will never approve this scheme. So, you are liars and cheats. That’s what this boils down to. You’re liars and cheats.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic state Sen. Val Applewhite said Republican lawmakers were going along with Trump’s “coordinated national effort to reshape this country’s political map in his image to guarantee one thing: that Donald Trump and only Donald Trump remains in power.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/uva-trump-administration-settlement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"Trump administration announces agreement with UVA","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has announced a landmark agreement with the University of Virginia, the first public university to do so, resolving ongoing investigations into its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.

\n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:20 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has reached  an agreement  with the University of Virginia, according to an announcement from the Department of Justice, marking the first public university to reach a deal with the White House after months of turmoil.\n \n\n   \n  The university has signed on to Justice Department guidelines on federal funding and discrimination and has agreed to “not engage in unlawful racial discrimination in its university programming, admissions, hiring, or other activities,” the Wednesday announcement said.\n \n\n   \n  Under the terms of the deal, UVA will not pay any financial settlement, unlike previous agreements reached with schools like  Columbia University  and  Brown University  to restore those schools’ federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  Nor will UVA have an outside monitor ensuring compliance – which was a key provision of Columbia’s agreement, and one that drew criticism about the federal government’s role on campus. Instead, the Justice Department said, “UVA will provide relevant information and data to the Department of Justice on a quarterly basis through 2028.”\n \n\n   \n  “The agreement does not require the University to make any monetary payments. Importantly, it preserves the academic freedom of our faculty, students, and staff. We will be treated no less favorably than any other university in terms of federal research grants and funding. The agreement does not involve external monitoring,” UVA interim President Paul Mahoney said in a letter to the school community Wednesday evening. “Instead, the University will update the Department of Justice quarterly on its efforts to ensure compliance with federal law.”\n \n\n   \n  In return, the Trump administration will pause ongoing investigations into the school, including its “admissions policies and other civil rights concerns,” the department said. Pending changes to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, the department “will close its investigations against UVA.”\n \n\n   \n  The agreement, which the New York Times first reported earlier Wednesday was close, marks the latest development in the Trump administration’s broader battle over campus oversight, federal funding and academic freedom.\n \n\n   \n  In June, the school’s president, James Ryan,  announced his resignation  amid pressure from the Department of Justice to dismantle the university’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Ryan’s resignation, the university’s board of visitors unanimously voted to scrap its Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Partnerships,  according  to Virginia GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office.\n \n\n   \n  But the university’s actions didn’t go far enough for the Justice Department and some conservative groups. Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, told CNN at the time that the university began “using a series of euphemisms to simply rebrand and repackage the exact same discriminatory programs that are illegal under federal law.”\n \n\n   \n  Dhillon praised Wednesday’s agreement as “notable” and said in a statement it would “protect students and faculty from unlawful discrimination, ensuring that equal opportunity and fairness are restored.”\n \n\n   \n  UVA is one of seven universities to reject what the Trump administration deemed a “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” that would unlock preferential access to federal funding. The offer, initially presented to nine schools earlier this month, included a series of demands, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with the Department of Justice’s announcement of an agreement with UVA.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/white-house-east-wing-demolition-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:24:00-04:00","title":"Why Trump’s sudden East Wing demolition is extraordinary — and dicey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has initiated the demolition of the White House East Wing to make way for a large, possibly oversized ballroom — a move that contradicts his earlier assurances that the renovation would not interfere with the existing structure.

He noted his New York projects often took years to break ground.\n \n\n   \n  “They said, ‘Sir, you can start tonight,’” Trump said. “I said, what are you talking about? ‘You have zero zoning conditions. You’re the president of’ – I said, you got to be kidding.”\n \n\n   \n  The president continued to marvel: “He said, ‘Sir, this is the White House. You’re the president of the United States. You can do anything you want.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has now done what he wants — in ways that are causing plenty of consternation.\n \n\n   \n  Images of the  demolition of the existing East Wing , where the new ballroom will be located, have  spurred apoplexy  among Trump’s detractors and growing criticism from architectural and preservation groups.\n \n\n   \n  The optics have also, perhaps tellingly, set off some metaphorical damage control at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The Treasury Department, which sits next to the East Wing, has instructed employees not to share photos of the demolition. (The department claimed in a statement to CNN this was to protect sensitive information.) The administration has railed against the “manufactured outrage” about the demolition in a series of social media posts and TV interviews. And the White House on Tuesday published  an extensive blog post  recapping previous renovations to the grounds.\n \n\n   \n  But there are a number of reasons why this situation is remarkable — and different from your usual presidential renovation.\n \n\n   \n  A big one is that the scenes this week fly in the face of how this was billed.\n \n\n   \n  When the project was announced in late July, Trump assured it “won’t interfere with the current building.”\n \n\n   \n  “It won’t be — it’ll be near it but not touching it,” he said at the time\n \n\n   \n  Much of the East Wing has now been torn down. While many Trump defenders wagered early this week photos made the demolition look more extensive than it actually was, the Washington Post reported late Tuesday that “ it appeared that what remained was also headed for demolition , with no evidence that the structure was being protected and only jagged damage visible in the exposed building.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked to account for Trump’s past comments, White House aide Will Scharf effectively acknowledged that plans had changed.\n \n\n   \n  “The scope and size was always subject to vary as the project developed,” Scharf, who also oversees federal construction as head of the National Capital Planning Commission,  told Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  The White House also assured that the construction planning would go through a robust process.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement when the project was announced, chief of staff Susie Wiles said Trump and the White House were “fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserve the special history of the White House.”\n \n\n   \n  There is very little evidence that’s actually happened.\n \n\n   \n  A number of groups that you might expect to be involved in such a process have criticized the lack of consultation or pushed for more.\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, on Tuesday  requested a pause in the demolition . It urged the White House to “go through the legally required public review processes … and to invite comment from the public.”\n \n\n   \n  The Society of Architectural Historians last week expressed “ great concern ” about the ballroom project. The group said it generally limited “its advocacy to matters of national and international import,” while urging a more “rigorous and deliberate design and review process.”\n \n\n   \n  And the American Institute of Architects back in August urged a number of steps that don’t appear to have been followed, including a rigorous search for the best architect and transparency about the process and its funding.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has said the $200 million project, which he said last week has been fully funded, is being paid for by private donations. Some donors have been named. But the White House has  not yet released a comprehensive list  or a breakdown of the donations.\n \n\n   \n  “This is more than an addition to a building,” the American Institute of Architects   wrote in August , arguing that it should be “ guided by a process that is preservation-first, performance-driven, and accountable to the public.”\n \n\n   \n  As recently as last month, Scharf suggested that even the National Capital Planning Commission he leads hadn’t been involved up to that point. He noted that it had no specific role in the demolition aspect.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” Scharf said.\n \n\n   \n  And the last point is that, yes, other presidents have overseen renovations. But the scale of this is on another level.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the  projects listed by the White House  Tuesday were much smaller and included no structural changes — like building swimming pools, internal refurbishments and restorations, landscaping and hardscaping.\n \n\n   \n  The list even included President Barack Obama installing a garden for the White House kitchen and converting a tennis court so that it could be used for basketball.\n \n\n   \n  The Society of Architectural Historians said the new White House ballroom will be the first “major change to its exterior appearance” since 1942. And even then, that project was merely adding to the existing East Wing, with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt adding a second story featuring additional office space and an emergency bunker.\n \n\n   \n  Even that relatively minor change led to criticisms from Republicans, who called the project wasteful and accused Roosevelt of doing it for political purposes, according to  the White House Historical Association .\n \n\n   \n  The ballroom will also be massive. It was initially described as accommodating 650 guests, but Trump told NBC News last month that it would wind up  being “a little bigger” than initially billed . He has more recently said that number could stretch to nearly 1,000.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often exaggerates the size of properties, so it’s not clear whether the ballroom will now actually be bigger than the initially planned 90,000-square-foot facility. But the National Trust for Historic Preservation cautioned Tuesday that even the initially planned size would “overwhelm the White House itself,” given the main White House building is 55,000 square feet.\n \n\n   \n  And again, that calls into question how this project was billed.\n \n\n   \n  In between his boasts about his power to make this happen quickly last week, Trump expressed that he “didn’t want to dwarf anything.”\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION:  This story has been updated to remove a quote that the  Associated Press  inaccurately attributed to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/barack-obama-california-redistricting","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:29:00Z","title":"Barack Obama joins Gavin Newsom to promote California Democrats’ effort to redraw US House maps","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former President Barack Obama joined California Governor Gavin Newsom in a virtual event to promote Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment that would allow Democrats to redraw U.S. House maps in California to counter Republican gerrymandering.

as advocates ask public to be vigilant during shutdown \n       \n  By Brian Todd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:42 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The site of one of the most iconic battlefields in American history suffered recent damage, prompting a law enforcement investigation.\n \n\n   \n  A National Park Service ranger, who asked not to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN there is extensive damage to a stone wall by a parking lot in the Devil’s Den area of  Gettysburg National Military Park  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  The ranger says the damage was reported to the National Park Service on the morning of October 14, and the park service’s law enforcement arm is investigating.\n \n\n   \n  On its Facebook page, the  Gettysburg Foundation , a non-profit partner of the park,  posted  pictures of the wall with a section collapsed, and parts of stone strewn on the ground. The post implores the public to help protect the park. “Remember that we are all stewards of National Park Service sites! Our priority is the safety of our visitors, as well as the protection of our National Parks. Think like the cavalry and be the eyes and ears for the National Park Service during the government shutdown. If you see something, say something,” the post says.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Gettysburg Foundation told CNN there is no video of the incident and there were no eyewitnesses, so they are not sure if it was vandalism or an accident.\n \n\n   \n  The park ranger noted “this isn’t just a little bump or dent” caused by a vehicle over-shooting its parking space. “This is significantly more than that.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if the wall could be repaired, the ranger said, “It can be repaired to its original state, but it’s going to take time and money, neither of which we have right now.”\n \n\n   \n  While the Gettysburg Foundation spokesperson says that the stone wall itself has no historical significance, Devil’s Den was the scene of intense fighting between Union and Confederate forces on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, with both sides suffering heavy casualties at the location.\n \n\n   \n  A  National Park Service  spokesperson told CNN in a statement, “preliminary indications suggest the wall was struck by a vehicle. The wall serves as a parking barrier and has been damaged before by vehicles attempting to turn or park in the small lot… The surrounding landscape and boulder formations remain intact and protected.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident has raised anxieties for the  National Parks Conservation Association .\n \n\n   \n  “These Civil War battlefields are open-air museums”, said Ed Stierli, Mid-Atlantic Senior Regional Director of the NPCA.  “We’re really concerned.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Park Service contends the parks are protected. “Our law enforcement rangers are at 100% capacity as we continue to prioritize critical functions that protect life, property, and public health, including law enforcement, emergency response, and visitor access. During this time, all of our law enforcement rangers are on duty and conducting regular patrols,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation comes as park advocates and local business proprietors have said there are increased reports of trash buildup and other problems at national parks during the government shutdown. CNN has received accounts of park-goers flying drones and base-jumping at locations like Yosemite National Park in California. These actions are generally illegal inside national parks.\n \n\n   \n  The National Park Service spokesperson said that at Gettysburg, “There has been no increase in vandalism, trash buildup or visitor misconduct unique to the shutdown period.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/trump-doj-request-230-mil-explained","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:07:00Z","title":"What we know about Trump’s bid to claim $230 million from his own Justice Department","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has filed two administrative claims with the Department of Justice under the Federal Tort Claims Act, seeking $230 million in compensation for investigations into his 2016 Russia campaign and the 2022 Mar-a-Lago home search.

\nUpdated: \n        5:07 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s demand that his own  Justice Department hand over $230 million  as compensation for federal investigations into his behavior is an unprecedented example of how his past indictment lingers over the presidency.\n \n\n   \n  His ask, made through administrative claims filed in 2023 and 2024 — and reported as of Wednesday to be still on the table by the  New York Times  —   also shines a light on the possible ethics conflicts that arise from his decision to install his former defense lawyers to run the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Trump now has the ability to sue the federal government and leave the courts to decide whether he was harmed and deserved compensation. But, the saga could also end with his own Justice Department negotiating with him, and choosing to cut a deal that would likely require approval from one of his former attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear why these claims have resurfaced now.\n \n\n   \n  One person who had worked with Trump in the past simply said Trump doesn’t forget.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s going down the list and checking it twice. And he doesn’t really need to decide to be naughty or nice,” said the person, who was familiar with Trump’s decision making when the most recent claim, related to the  search of his Mar-a-Lago home , was filed.\n \n\n   \n  There is no final word on whether Trump will receive that payment, and the DOJ is not required to publicly announce settlements it reaches over administrative claims.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s $230 million demand, though, far dwarfs past DOJ payouts to the victims of sex abuse and mass shootings whose murder or exploitation were attributable to mistakes by the government.\n \n\n   \n     The claims \n \n\n   \n  Trump filed his two complaints to the Justice Department in the form of an administrative claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act — a first step to see whether a settlement can be reached before suing the government for damages.\n \n\n   \n  Claims are filed on something called a Standard Form 95, in which a person outlines how they were injured by the federal government and what financial compensation they are seeking. Should DOJ officials reject the claim, the person could then file a lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s case, his attorneys filed two separate administrative claims over allegations that he was damaged by the several federal investigations and prosecutions he faced both during his first term as president and while he was out of office, according to the New York Times and the forms they have published.\n \n\n   \n  The first claim, filed in 2023, seeks damages over the investigations into whether his 2016 presidential campaign had worked with Russia to help him win the election. The second, filed in 2024, accuses the FBI and DOJ of violating Trumps privacy during a search of his  Mar-a-Lago  estate and of malicious prosecution for the subsequent charges he faced over mishandling classified documents.\n \n\n   \n  While neither investigation resulted in Trump’s conviction (he was never charged in the Russia investigation and a federal judge tossed the classified documents case), the president has pointed to both as evidence that democratic officials weaponized the justice system against him.\n \n\n   \n  In the Mar-a-Lago claim, Trump says he was wronged especially in the decision by the FBI and Justice Department to search his house without his cooperation.\n \n\n   \n  “[Then-Attorney General Merrick] Garland and [then-FBI Director Christopher] Wray should have never approved a raid and subsequent indictment of President Trump because the well-established protocol with former U.S. presidents is to use non-enforcement means to obtain records of the United States,” his claim letter said.\n \n\n   \n  In that claim, Trump requests compensation for his legal costs, which he says were about $15 million related to being a criminal defendant charged in court. Trump also says in his claim he deserves a $100 million compensation for punitive damages.\n \n\n   \n  The lawyer who filed the Mar-a-Lago complaint on Trump’s behalf, Daniel Epstein, hasn’t responded to multiple inquiries from CNN.\n \n\n   \n     Settlement negotiations \n \n\n   \n  Though Trump filed the claims while out of office, the Justice Department did not act on it under the previous administration because of its practice to pause any civil litigation, including administrative claims, while there is a criminal investigation pending, a person familiar with the process told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s settlement requests reportedly amount to $230 million — a number that far surpasses the  $138.7 million settlement  made to the victims of convicted sex abuser Larry Nassar, the $144.4 million settlement made with the families of victims in the Sutherland Springs mass shooting in Texas, and the  $88 million settlement  made to the families of victims in the Mother Emanuel church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  So far in 2025, the federal judgment has paid out only $207 million for settlements in claims made against the Justice Department, according to federal data from the Treasury Department.\n \n\n   \n  That total number represents more than 250 total claims, many of which received payments of less than $2 million each, and are linked to issues of employment discrimination, incidents with the Bureau of Prisons system and environmental hazardous waste cleanup.\n \n\n   \n  If the DOJ agrees to Trump’s staggering request,  taxpayers  would likely foot the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Trump acknowledged reports of settlement negotiations Tuesday,  saying  in the Oval Office that he “could be” seeking $230 million from his own Justice Department as compensation for past investigations into him. He professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it,” Trump said. “All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of negotiations between Trump’s attorneys and the Justice Department are not clear. Trump acknowledged Tuesday the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump does not have the authority to personally approve the settlement, however. Such a decision would need to be made by Todd Blanche, his former attorney and current Deputy attorney general, or Stanley Woodward, the associate attorney general who previously worked as counsel to one of Trump’s senior aides charged in the classified documents case.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin told CNN that “all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials” should top officials be conflicted in the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi fired her top ethics advisor in July, CNN  previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  “He has vacated almost all the internal oversight offices, not only within the Department of Justice, but across the government,” John Dean, President Richard Nixon’s White House Counsel, said in an interview with CNN. Dean said the move was “clearly intentional” and means that “there’s no check here.”\n \n\n   \n  “That doesn’t mean that everybody isn’t watching,” Dean said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-curtis-sliwa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-04:00","title":"Curtis Sliwa uses a 'Braveheart' reference to explain why he won’t drop out of the NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for New York City mayor, refuses to drop out of the race despite intense pressure from allies of Andrew Cuomo and business interests, including WABC owner John Catsimatidis and investor Bill Ackman.

explain why he won’t drop out of the NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:29 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for mayor of New York, can hardly believe the position he finds himself in.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past few weeks, I feel like I’m watching an Eddie Murphy movie, ‘Trading Places,’” he said during a fiery appearance Wednesday morning on the New York radio station where he hosted a show before taking leave to run for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  “Cuomo is on WABC all the time now,” he said, “while I’m out on the campaign trail, pinching babies, shaking hands. He’s become the radio guy; now I’m the politician.”\n \n\n   \n  A longtime fixture in New York City politics, Sliwa now has a key role in one of the most consequential mayoral races in decades. Heading into the second general election debate Wednesday at 7 p.m., Sliwa is likely to be at the center of the discussion, even as he runs third in the polls.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa is the target of a frantic pressure campaign to drop out of the mayoral race from opponents of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani who want to create a one-on-one matchup between Mamdani and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. Among the people pressuring Sliwa is WABC owner John Catsimatidis, a top New York Republican and ally of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a Queens native himself, has all but written Sliwa off. Several of Sliwa’s former colleagues at WABC have urged him to drop out. And Cuomo on Monday predicted his “collapse.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, however, insists he will not exit. He colorfully maintained his defiance Wednesday, accusing former WABC colleagues of “stabbing” him in the back and vowing that he would never come back to the station.\n \n\n   \n  Using another cinematic metaphor, Sliwa rejected any potential partnerships with Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  “Remember that scene in ‘Braveheart?’” Sliwa asked. “Mel Gibson at the end, when the executioner was impaling him?  If all of a sudden, the executioner would’ve stopped, and I was on that gurney, and said, ‘Hey, you can work for Mayor Andrew Cuomo,’ I would say, ‘Finish the job. Impale me.’”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, has alarmed some moderate Democrats with his  progressive ideas ,  past criticisms of police  and relative lack of experience. Some Jewish voters are concerned about his  criticisms of Israel  and question his commitment to fighting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  But the upstart progressive has been consolidating his support since the primary, opening a double-digit lead over Cuomo and Mamdani in public polling. He’s won the endorsements of several key Democrats, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and  met with Jewish groups  and  police officers  as he tries to shore up perceived weaknesses.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s backers have watched with frustration and blame Sliwa for splintering the anti-Mamdani vote. The investor Bill Ackman, among the most vocal Cuomo proponents on social media,  claimed  that Mamdani “is actively working” to keep Sliwa in the race. Mamdani has mocked Ackman and dismissed that claim.\n \n\n   \n  In tearing into Cuomo and the business interests backing him, Sliwa at times seems to echo Mamdani, the democratic socialist, with his sharp criticism of billionaires and elites. In an interview with the journalist Nate Friedman released over the weekend, the GOP nominee told Ackman to “stay in your lane.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa’s Republican supporters in the city have signaled their intention to stand by the party’s nominee. On Tuesday ahead of the final debate, a collection of county Republican Party chairs – including Catsimatidis’ daughter Andrea, the Manhattan GOP chair – issued a joint statement affirming that “our party is united behind Curtis Sliwa.”\n \n\n   \n  Previous Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani has also maintained his support for Sliwa and hosted the candidate on his own show. “Curtis Sliwa has my complete and total endorsement,” he  said .\n \n\n   \n  “The undecided ones, if this is like any other political situation, are going to break the same way, or they’re not going to vote,” Giuliani said Monday. “Remember, it’s a poll. And it’s not just they’re unfair to Trump, they are, that’s given. They’re also very often completely useless.”\n \n\n   \n  And on WABC Wednesday, Sliwa dismissed hypothetical outcomes if he continued his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “To me they’re the same,” Sliwa said, when asked if he’d prefer Cuomo or Mamdani to become the next mayor. “First day of voting is on Saturday.

Melissa is now forecast to become a major hurricane as it trends toward a concerning track \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Mary Gilbert, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:03 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa is crawling through the Caribbean Sea, threatening to unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides across parts of the region later this week. It’s proof this year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  is not over yet, and Melissa has plenty of time and fuel ahead.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was about 300 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was churning forward at an agonizingly slow 2 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rain is already spreading north Wednesday as Melissa moves at a snail’s pace toward Jamaica and Haiti. A foot or more of rain is possible in southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through this weekend. That much rain over mountainous terrain in the area could trigger catastrophic flash flooding and landslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is moving over water that’s so warm it’s essentially rocket fuel for storms this late in the season, and is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday morning.\n \n\n   \n  When that happens, it will be the 2025 Atlantic season’s fifth hurricane and the first to spin up inside the Caribbean. It’s also now forecast to become the season’s fourth major hurricane — Category 3 or greater.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica. There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Two possible outcomes, neither good\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios. The possibilities have changed slightly from initial forecasts, but both place Hispaniola and Jamaica in harm’s way.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring close to a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, which is the island that houses the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as it drifts closer to the island through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still unclear exactly what parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. Jamaica could also receive torrential, flooding rainfall beginning later this week.\n \n\n   \n  The islands will also face strong, potentially damaging winds from Melissa, especially after it reaches hurricane strength Saturday, according to the hurricane center’s forecast.\n \n\n   \n  Slow-moving storms like Melissa hit the same areas with torrential rain and strong winds for days, significantly increasing rainfall totals and   the likelihood of   power outages. Melissa will start moving quicker at some point, and exactly when and where that happens is extremely important to determine its impacts. It’s also still quite unclear.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa’s current forecast track holds and the storm moves slowly west toward an area south of Jamaica into early next week, it could end up where the atmosphere and extremely warm water align to boost the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is now expected to become at least a Category 4 major hurricane by Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Its anticipated explosion in strength from tapping into that energy is something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  A stronger Melissa would eventually turn northeast next week and threaten other portions of the Caribbean, like Cuba.   That scenario would increase the intensity of all of Melissa’s impacts from rain to wind and dangerous seas.\n \n\n   \n  Alternatively, there’s still a chance that another weather pattern could pull Melissa north toward Jamaica or Haiti early next week. This path would likely prevent Melissa from reaching the strength it might in the first scenario, but could also mean a direct landfall and more concentrated impacts in either location.\n \n\n   \n    Is this a threat to the US?\n \n\n   \n  A direct hit on the mainland US is unlikely, but not impossible. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  Florida could be in play if Melissa takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.\n \n\n   \n  The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently,  Hurricane Nicole  slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and  Hurricane Zeta  smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.\n \n\n   \n  As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.\n \n\n   \n  Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/middleeast/icj-israel-humanitarian-aid-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00Z","title":"UN’s top court rebukes Israel over Gaza aid restrictions during war","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations’ International Court of Justice issued a non-binding advisory opinion on October 22, 2025, stating that Israel, as an occupying power, is legally obligated to allow and facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza, including enabling the operations of UNRWA.

       4:56 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United Nations’ top court issued a legal opinion Wednesday stating that Israel, as an occupying power, is obligated to work with UN agencies   to facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza, a rebuke of the  blockade  it imposed on the Palestinian enclave earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The International Court of Justice also said in its advisory opinion that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the main UN body serving Palestinian refugees, has not violated impartiality rules and that Israel must support the agency’s relief work.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion was requested by the UN General Assembly in December after  Israel passed laws banning UNRWA,  from operating in the country, significantly curtailing its ability to deliver aid to Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The occupying power may never invoke reasons of security to justify the general suspension of all humanitarian activities in occupied territory,” Judge Iwasawa Yuji said while delivering the opinion, which also said Israel is obliged to ensure the basic needs of civilians in Gaza are met. “After examining the evidence, the court finds that the local population in Gaza Strip has been inadequately supplied.”\n \n\n   \n  The advisory opinion – aimed at addressing Israel’s obligations to the UN, aid organizations and third-party states in the occupied West Bank and Gaza – is non-binding, but it does carry political weight and is expected to increase pressure on Israel to cooperate with the UN and other aid agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s ambassador to the UN criticized the court’s opinion as “shameful.”\n \n\n   \n  The US State Department called the opinion “corrupt” and claimed that it “unfairly bashes Israel and gives UNRWA a free pass for its deep entanglement with and material support for Hamas terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel has accused UNRWA of having more than a thousand employees affiliated with Hamas, and of teaching hate against Israel in its schools. UNRWA has repeatedly denied the accusations, saying there are no grounds for “a blanket description” of the whole institution as being infiltrated by Hamas. A  UN investigation found  that nine employees from UNWRA’s 13,000 staff in Gaza “may have” been involved in the Hamas-led October 7 attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But the court said Wednesday that Israel has not substantiated allegations ﻿“that a significant part of UNRWA employees are members of Hamas or other terrorist factions.”\n \n\n   \n  “The court concludes that in the present circumstances, the United Nations, acting through UNRWA, has been an indispensable provider of humanitarian relief in the Gaza Strip,” the judge said, also criticizing the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which Israel has claimed was a replacement for some of UNRWA’s work.\n \n\n   \n  “The court recalls Israel’s obligation not to use starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare as an occupying power,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli officials have accused the UN court of being politicized and weaponized against Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “They are blaming Israel for not cooperating with UN organs … They should be blaming themselves. Those organs became breeding grounds for terrorists,” Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the UN, claimed Wednesday in response to the opinion, which he described as a “political document.”\n \n\n   \n  A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been in place for more than a week, and Israel is allowing increased aid into Gaza in line with the truce agreement’s goal of 600 trucks per day, according to US and Israeli officials.\n \n\n   \n  Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General, welcomed the “unambiguous” legal opinion in a post on X and stated that the UN has the resources to “immediately scale up” the humanitarian response in the territory.\n \n\n   \n    More international court cases pending\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s opinion is one of several cases related to Israel that the UN court has weighed in on since the war began in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024, the ICJ said that Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an  unprecedented move  that called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories that Palestinians want for a future state.\n \n\n   \n  The sweeping opinion ran through a list of Israeli practices that the ICJ said violated international law, including confiscating land, building Israeli settlements in the territories, and depriving Palestinians of natural resources and the right to self-determination. In a case that predated the Israel-Hamas war, the court said Israel abused its position as an occupying power and called on it to cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians firmly rejected that ICJ opinion at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The ICJ also issued a series of emergency measures related to Gaza in 2024, including ordering Israel to  immediately halt  its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, classifying the humanitarian situation there as “disastrous.”\n \n\n   \n  Those measures are part of a broader case brought by South Africa against Israel, which accuses Israel of breaching its obligations under the genocide convention – a claim Israel has vehemently and repeatedly denied.\n \n\n   \n  The ICJ case on genocide is ongoing and expected to last several years. It comes against a backdrop of an  independent UN inquiry ’s conclusion in September that found Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which echoed the findings of other  genocide experts  and  human rights groups , and which Israel rejected.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli government has maintained that it conducted the war in Gaza in compliance with international law. The government has also repeatedly accused the UN of anti-Israel bias.\n \n\n   \n  The UN court’s proceedings are separate from the investigation into alleged war crimes in Gaza being carried out by  the International Criminal Court  – another international legal body based in The Hague, Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  Late last year, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and a now-deceased senior Hamas official, Mohammed Deif, who Israel has said was one of the masterminds of the October 7 attacks, and others.\n \n\n   \n  Israel doesn’t recognize the ICC, but it is bound by the statute of the ICJ as a UN member state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/entertainment/bon-jovi-tour","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00Z","title":"Jon Bon Jovi Returns on Tour After Vocal Surgery","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jon Bon Jovi is returning to tour with his band for the first time since undergoing vocal surgery in 2022, with the tour set to begin in July 2026 at Madison Square Garden in New York City and include performances in London, Dublin, and Edinburgh.

first World Series \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:41 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the  Seattle Mariners , the wait goes on.\n \n\n   \n  One game away from reaching a first World Series in franchise history, Seattle fell heartbreakingly short in Monday’s 4-3  defeat  against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n \n\n   \n  The gut-wrenching loss ensures that the Mariners’ unwanted record as the only team in Major League Baseball never to appear at the Fall Classic remains very much intact.\n \n\n   \n  To see how much this moment pained Seattle and its players, look no further than MVP candidate  Cal Raleigh , who was reduced to tears at the end of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I love every guy in this room, but ultimately, it’s not what we wanted,” Raleigh told reporters after the game. “I hate to use the word failure, but it’s a failure.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what we expected: to get to the World Series and win a World Series. That’s what the bar is and the standard is – that’s what we want to hold ourselves accountable to – but it hurts.”\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh was far from alone in his pain. “We’ve put in so much work and effort through this whole year and it’s over,” said Seattle center fielder Julio Rodríguez. “That’s also part of the game too.”\n \n\n   \n  The disappointment is also felt strongly among the team’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “As someone who’s a Seattle transplant, I don’t quite have the decades of embedded angst that some locals may carry with them,” Mariners fan Gabe Guarente, 48, told  CNN Sports . “But I do sort of share their fatalistic view of the team. We don’t really expect good things to happen, so when they do, it’s more of a pleasant surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s why this year’s ALCS Game 7 loss felt both inevitable and completely heartbreaking at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  Guarente described his emotions after the defeat as “gloomy … with an undercurrent of simmering rage at the cruel baseball gods.”\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions during this year’s American League Championship Series (ALCS), the signs looked so promising for the Mariners. They jumped into a 2-0 series lead, then went 3-2 up after victory in Game 5.\n \n\n   \n  And in the winner-takes-all game at Toronto’s Rodgers Centre, Seattle went 3-1 ahead when Raleigh launched his fifth home run of the postseason and fourth against the Blue Jays, putting his team in control of the contest at the top of the fifth.\n \n\n   \n  That, however, would be the high point of a miserable night for the Mariners. George Springer’s three-run homer saw Toronto move ahead in the seventh inning, and with that, Seattle’s hopes evaporated.\n \n\n   \n  Having never in their 49-season history been so close to appearing at the World Series, right now, it might feel like the Mariners have never been further away.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s crazy because, at the beginning of September, we weren’t even in the playoff running,” Mariners fan and podcast host Hayley  told  CNN affiliate KING 5 Seattle. “So to go this far, I think it’s really hard right now. But for every fan, it showed what we could do.”\n \n\n   \n  In time, they will be able to reflect on the team’s successful year, reaching a first ALCS since 2001 with a thrilling, near-five-hour win over the Detroit Tigers.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-year-old Raleigh has been the heartbeat of this Seattle team, hitting an MLB-leading 60 home runs in the regular season, only the seventh player in history to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  He signed a reported six-year, $105 million contract extension back in March, while Rodríguez is also locked into a long-term contract through 2029.\n \n\n   \n  For the Mariners – just the fourth team to lead a best-of-seven series 2-0 in the postseason and not advance – the ambition of reaching a first-ever World Series is still there, even in the post-mortem of a brutal loss.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us now have had a taste of how close we can get and how good this team can be,” said manager Dan Wilson. “Once you get that, that’s what you’re shooting for the next year and I know that will continue to be the goal … to get to that final step.\n \n\n   \n  “This year, we were one game short.”\n \n\n   \n  Fans like Guarente are cautiously optimistic about the future, given the talent and age profile of the Seattle team.\n \n\n   \n  “If they invest even a little bit in free agency, I think they can get back in this position,” he said. “It helps that the AL West is not a juggernaut, and the Astros’ empire is on the decline.\n \n\n   \n  “So, yes, I do think the Mariners can reach the World Series in the near future. They’ll have to get more of that  Humpy The Salmon  magic back, though.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/fed-interest-rates-govt-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:14:00-20:00","title":"The Shutdown Is Complicating the Fed’s Ability to Help the Economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown from October 1, 2025, has severely disrupted the Federal Reserve’s access to official economic data, including unemployment and retail sales, complicating its ability to assess the labor market and inflation.

The government shutdown just made that fight even harder.\n \n\n   \n  To make determinations about its rate policy and other decisions to help the economy, the Fed relies heavily on official economic statistics that are collected and disseminated by the government. The shutdown has effectively  cut off access to that data  — from the unemployment rate to retail sales — since the beginning of October.\n \n\n   \n  With just one week to go before the Fed’s next decision on interest rates, officials are flying partially blind as they assess whether the labor market requires additional support, after data through August showed  the weakest pace of hiring since 2010  and rising unemployment among young Americans and minorities.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest wrinkle for policymakers as they tackle a continued attack from the Trump administration on their independence, an ongoing housing affordability crisis that the Fed doesn’t have all the tools to fix, the potential effects of AI, persistent inflation, uncertainty around tariffs and a slowdown in the job market.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed and the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of government data, Fed officials have turned to other sources to gauge the labor market and consumer spending — two important drivers of the US economy and the focus of the Fed’s so-called dual mandate to balance economic growth with keeping prices in check.\n \n\n   \n  The problem is that government data is undisputedly the “gold standard” of how the world’s largest economy is measured. Without it, the Fed’s decision making is not fully informed. And the Fed might have even less access to private employment data this time around, after payroll software provider ADP ended its data-sharing agreement with the Fed in August, according to  The American Prospect .\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that the Fed misjudges where the state of its dual mandate sits, whether inflation or the labor market is the bigger concern,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at asset manager Glenmede, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Fed officials set monetary policy without key economic data was during the 2018-2019 shutdown. Minutes from the Fed’s  January 2019 meeting  showed how officials turned to figures on card transactions and vehicles sales in the absence of the Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t call it a data drought,” New York Fed President John Williams told the New York Times in an interview published on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still getting a significant amount of data,” he added, pointing to surveys from the Conference Board, the New York Fed and the Institute for Supply Management. Those surveys measure trends in prices, demand, production and overall economic activity.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release the Consumer Price Index for September, having recalled staff to ensure the report can be used as a basis for  Social Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustments. \n \n\n   \n  Still, that leaves the Fed in the dark on the labor market’s true health and trajectory. Economists widely agree that private-sector figures cannot fully replace government data, especially considering that the government’s numbers serve as the benchmark for much of the private data.\n \n\n   \n    A housing affordability crisis the Fed can’t fix\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s main tool — its key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs more broadly — is particularly effective at making borrowing cheaper or more costly, depending on whether the Fed is trying to tamp down inflation or boost employment. So, it’s pretty good at changing how much consumers demand goods and services.\n \n\n   \n  But it does nothing to balance the “supply” side of the supply and demand equation, which is precisely what continues to drive up prices in some parts of the country, such as the Northeast.\n \n\n   \n  Sales of previously owned homes have been sluggish for the third-straight year, and persistently elevated mortgage rates have certainly played a role in keeping buyers on the sidelines. But so has the housing shortage.\n \n\n   \n  “Sales of affordable homes are constrained by the lack of inventory,” National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement last month.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed has already acknowledged that there’s only so much it can do to alleviate America’s housing woes.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a long-term housing shortage,” Powell said in a news conference after the Fed’s July meeting. “This is not something the Fed can help with.”\n \n\n   \n    The impacts of AI and economic uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s aggressive bid to reshape global trade has forced many businesses to put hiring plans on ice as they wait to see how everything plays out. And at the same time, many companies are actively trying to figure out how to implement AI into their operations.\n \n\n   \n  The result: unusually weak hiring, largely driven by businesses feeling paralyzed. But for some workers, it’s also because of AI.\n \n\n   \n  “The labor market has been frozen up because people are just having a hard time making decisions,” Laura Ullrich, an economist at Indeed, told CNN. “And AI is certainly having some impact on entry-level tech jobs.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate cuts should function like a tide that lifts all boats by making borrowing cheaper, allowing companies to expand head count. But that might not be enough to shore up demand for workers in roles that are increasingly being automated by AI.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, while the Fed is poised to lower rates further, “so long as economic uncertainty is high, it’s hard to know exactly how many people you should hire,” Ullrich said.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment is borne out by businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management, who continue to express frustration over Trump’s significant policy changes and their ensuing effects on demand and planning.\n \n\n   \n  “Client demand in professional services remains steady, though decision-making timelines are lengthening due to continued economic uncertainty and interest-rate concerns,” one business said in ISM’s September services survey.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed is set to announce its latest monetary policy decision at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting ending on October 29, with a post-meeting news conference by Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET that day.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/russia-air-attack-kyiv-ukraine-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:58:00-12:58","title":"Deadly Russian air attacks force power cuts across Ukraine, as Trump-Putin summit shelved","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia launched a large-scale air assault on Ukraine, targeting key cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv with drones, missiles, and fighter jets, resulting in at least six deaths and over 25 injuries, widespread power outages, and fires in residential buildings.

 The attack, which involved drones, missiles and fighter jets, targeted vast swathes of the country, including the capital Kyiv, and came as uncertainty swirled over a proposed Putin-Trump summit . \n \n\n   \n  CNN reported Tuesday, citing a Trump administration official, that there were “no plans” for such a meeting in the immediate future. Trump said later he didn’t want the summit to be “a waste of time,” despite the US president saying last week the two leaders would be meeting in Budapest, Hungary, “within two weeks or so, pretty quick.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite Trump’s comments on Tuesday, Moscow said the following day that preparations were continuing.\n \n\n   \n  “Preparations for the summit are ongoing. They could take various forms,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, according to state news agency RIA Novosti, adding that there were “no significant obstacles” to the Russia-US top-level meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said energy infrastructure, as well as “ordinary cities” were targeted in Wednesday’s attacks.

According to preliminary information, many are experiencing acute stress reactions.”\n \n\n   \n  In his daily address Wednesday, Zelensky said Trump’s call for Ukraine and Russia to stop at the current frontlines was a “good compromise,” but added he doubted Putin would support it.\n \n\n   \n  Katarina Maternovak, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, described a “night of horror” overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I spent that night on the floor of my hotel bathroom, turned into a shelter.

The package includes historic reductions to America’s safety net programs, particularly Medicaid and food stamps, and at the same time slashes taxes, resulting “in a massive transfer” of resources from the poorest households to the richest.\n \n\n   \n  Growing gaps in incomes are a “major factor” explaining the rise of right-wing populism, says the 19-page report, citing several studies, including one that established “an almost perfect correlation” between income inequality and support for populist parties.\n \n\n   \n  The report also notes European Social Surveys – tracking public attitudes, beliefs and behavior – which show that there is a 25% chance unemployed people at the lowest levels of jobless benefits will vote for the far right versus 15% for those who are employed.\n \n\n   \n  Higher pension levels, better child allowances and minimum wage legislation also have a “statistically measurable impact” in reducing the likelihood of a vote for the far right.\n \n\n   \n  “Thousands of people in poverty I speak with tell me they feel stigmatized and monitored rather than supported,” De Schutter said. “Unless social protection is taken seriously as a human right, far-right populists will continue to reap what has been sown.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/hegseth-limit-congress-communication","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:47:00-04:00","title":"Hegseth Orders Prior Approval for All Military-Congress Interactions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring all Defense Department personnel—including military commanders and civilian leaders—to obtain prior approval from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs) before engaging with Congress or state lawmakers.

prior approval for ‘all interactions’ between military officials and Congress \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:47 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is barring nearly all Defense Department personnel, including military commanders, from talking to Congress or state lawmakers unless they have received prior approval from the agency’s office of legislative affairs, according to a memo signed this month by  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth  and obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Unauthorized engagements with Congress by [Defense Department] personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives,” says the memo.\n \n\n   \n  The directive applies to the civilian leaders of each military branch, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all combatant commanders and Defense Intelligence offices. The memo, dated October 15, does carve out an exception for the Pentagon Inspector General office, the agency’s internal watch dog.\n \n\n   \n  Breaking Defense  first reported  the details of the policy.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told CNN that the memo is “a pragmatic step to internally review the Department’s processes for communicating with Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Department intends to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency,” Parnell said. “This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information.”\n \n\n   \n  The memo is the latest in a series of steps by Hegseth to control information at the Pentagon and how the Pentagon communicates with those outside the agency. Hegseth,  whose tenure  has been beleaguered by leaks, has also moved to restrict engagement by Defense Department personnel with think tanks or other outside events and conferences. The memo was signed the same day that dozens of reporters  turned in their badges  rather than sign a document the Pentagon had produced that included restrictions on their work.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Pentagon official told CNN that the memo is consistent with longstanding Defense Department policy that has not been enforced in the past. A 2006-era directive states that all legislative activities “shall be centrally directed and carefully coordinated with the [assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs] prior to execution,” and that the assistant secretary would have “overall supervision” of legislative affairs for the department.\n \n\n   \n  And while the memo says explicitly that engagements must be coordinated or approved with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs), the senior official said some engagements can also be approved by the military services’ legislative offices instead of pushing them all the way up to the Pentagon’s legislative affairs office.\n \n\n   \n  However, a separate defense official told CNN on Wednesday that further internal guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense made clear the policy would restrict and centralize all communications with elected officials, and that even service legislative affairs staffers would need approval from OSD before responding to congressional inquiries.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not business as usual … They have been very clear across the military that this is a restriction, and they want to control it all centrally,” the defense official said.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says the Pentagon “relies on a collaborative and close partnership with Congress to achieve our legislative goals,” which requires “coordination of alignment of Department messaging.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously reported that Congress has had limited engagement with Hegseth to the frustration of lawmakers and staffers; a Senate aide told CNN there has been “significantly less” communication than what lawmakers expect.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways the memo is reminiscent of efforts by other administrations to control engagement with Congress, the Senate aide told CNN. For past administrations that has been in the form of a temporary pause in interactions or review.\n \n\n   \n  The aide said, the memo fits “a disturbing pattern of attempting to stifle communication with Congress and the public that is unique and characteristic to Pete Hegseth,” but that in practice it could be less restrictive than the language initially appears.\n \n\n   \n  “There is so much required and frankly beneficial interaction between Congress and the Department … There are very responsible and professional people who are doing their jobs and liaising with Congress, and 99% of it is business as usual,” the aide said. “I think this is a bad misunderstanding and frankly just another example of their paranoia to try to clamp down in this way.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior Pentagon official said the memo is not meant to be restrictive, but an effort to coordinate the Pentagon’s messaging to Congress to avoid mistakes like officials contradicting themselves to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  “When we go and we don’t coordinate our messaging, we run the risk of being in direct conflict with our budget request and our proposals on behalf of the Department,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been frustration with officials who are not in legislative affairs responding to questions from lawmakers or staffers on Capitol Hill, who are “answering on behalf of the Department and they’re not coordinating their messaging,” the senior official said.\n \n\n   \n  A former senior Pentagon official pointed to the logistical challenges of doing what the memo says is required, telling CNN that the Defense Department does thousands of engagements with Congress and state officials a month, talking with staffers regularly on everything from personnel and military installation issues to operational details. It would be logistically challenging to get prior approval and coordination for every one of those engagements.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says that the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, Dane Hughes, will conduct a review of all congressional affairs activities and submit a report to Hegseth detailing how to streamline activities, current issues with the congressional engagement process and more.\n \n\n   \n  Hughes said in a memo signed October 17 that he would be convening a working group as part of his review and directed senior leaders and combatant commanders to provide a senior official from their office who oversees legislative functions to participate.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/entertainment/suzanne-somers-ai-clone-husband","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:11:00-04:00","title":"Suzanne Somers’ AI Twin: Husband Creates Digital Legacy After Her Death","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Suzanne Somers, a well-known author and public health advocate who died in 2023, has inspired her husband Alan Hamel to create a detailed artificial intelligence clone known as the 'Suzanne AI Twin'.

New Delhi plunged into toxic darkness and world’s most polluted air \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul and Esha Mitra, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:21 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Around 20 million people in  India’s  capital woke up on Wednesday breathing the most polluted air of any major city in the world, a day after celebrations for the  Diwali festival , during which revelers typically set off fireworks and firecrackers.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday, New Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration – a measure of pollutants in the air – was more than 40 times the World Health Organization’s annualized guideline level, according to Swiss air quality monitoring company IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi grapples with severe year-round pollution, but the winter months are typically worst, when millions of farmers in surrounding regions burn stubble in their fields to clear the way for the next crop.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp deterioration in air quality this week comes following celebrations for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which traditionally involves the widespread use of firecrackers which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, as well as harmful heavy metals.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, authorities enacted a complete ban on making, selling or using firecrackers in New Delhi, citing hazardous pollution levels.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of so-called “green” firecrackers – which manufacturers claim are less polluting – but only within a certain time window. However, residents reported that this curfew was poorly enforced, with people bursting firecrackers long after the deadline, and that “non-green” firecrackers still appeared to be available.\n \n\n   \n  “Year on year, it goes from bad to worse,” said resident Anushka Singh.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old graphic designer said she usually stays at home at Diwali with her dog, to “help him through the incessant noise that doesn’t stop until late at night or early morning.”\n \n\n   \n  She described how her throat becomes scratchy, and her eyes begin to burn as she steps out of her home the day after Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  “Living in Delhi is a pain… I just wish that given the decades of data we would at least have stricter rules, ones that are actually implemented,” Singh said.\n \n\n   \n  Chandra Tandon, 52, who owns a corner store in the capital, said bursting crackers are “part of the fun and happens once a year,” but agreed that it becomes “difficult” for people who must endure the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  “I was breathing in those fumes throughout and it’s definitely not good,” she said. “It would be good if we left the crackers burning to the kids… If you’ve lived in Delhi long enough, you know how bad it gets every year with the pollution. So, adults at least should do their part.”\n \n\n   \n    A long-term crisis\n \n\n   \n  Despite the city being the political heart of the country, officials have had little success in cleaning up Delhi’s toxic air.\n \n\n   \n  Previous attempts to curb pollution have included sprinkling water on the roads, restricting traffic by requiring vehicles with odd or even license plates to travel on alternating days, and constructing in 2018 two smog towers worth 200 million rupees ($2.4 million), intended to act as giant air purifiers.\n \n\n   \n  But a lack of strict enforcement and coordination means progress has been slow, experts suggest.\n \n\n   \n  India is also desperate to fuel its booming economy and meet the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, three Indian cities, including New Delhi, were ranked among the world’s most polluted, according to air quality tracker IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  Kolkata in the east was in fourth place, while Mumbai in the west ranked number 10.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/former-president-sarkozy-police-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"09:23:00-04:00","title":"Former French President Sarkozy Accompanied by Police Officers Overnight as He Starts Prison Sentence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began serving a five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy involving the 2007 campaign financing from Libya.

conspiracy, would continue to receive protection in prison on account of his status and “given the threats he faces.”\n \n\n   \n  The minister, who was speaking Wednesday to radio station Europe 1, added that the safety measures would remain in effect “as long as it is deemed necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m in charge of the security of individuals, of high-ranking officials,” Nuñez said as he explained that it was his decision to extend Sarkozy’s protection while he serves his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a decision aimed at ensuring his security in addition, obviously, to everything

The lawyer said Sarkozy’s concern was not with himself, but his loved ones. “If he’s worried about anything, it’s his family,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Guillaume Sarkozy, the brother of the former leader, told BFMTV: “I am proud that we share the same name.

Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:08 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While praising  first lady Melania Trump’s  work to return Ukrainian children from Russian captivity,  President Donald Trump  last week seemed to downplay the estimates of the number of children allegedly abducted since the war began.\n \n\n   \n  Seated across the table in the White House Cabinet Room, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not try to correct his counterpart, nor did he answer a reporter’s question about whether he appreciated the American first lady’s efforts. Instead, he turned, cocked his head and silently nodded.\n \n\n   \n  The moment underscored deep sensitivity around a complex issue that the first lady has sought to resolve through direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Melania Trump, who has made the well-being and safety of children a priority, advocacy on this issue appeared to be a natural fit and an opportunity to use her massive global platform to make a difference.\n \n\n   \n  But in the week after  she announced  the return of eight Ukrainian children to their families, some advocates who have lauded the children’s return also raised concern in conversations with CNN about the way the first lady got involved — and especially her passive-voice characterization of how the children ended up in Russia, fearing that it will only end up playing to Putin.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from the White House earlier this month, the first lady described “Ukrainian children residing in Russia” and said they’d been “displaced to the Russian Federation because of front-line fighting” — but did not talk about the war crime that many advocates see in Moscow’s alleged abduction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is moving very carefully, but everyone is clear on the point that the first lady’s office needs to hear: Thank you — but it is 35,000 kids, not seven or eight,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, whose Ukraine Conflict Observatory is operating on private donations through the end of the year after the Trump administration  cut its funding .\n \n\n   \n  “It is kids who were taken as a war crime and kids who are being militarized and were abducted by a state — not lost in the war. Language matters,” Raymond said.\n \n\n   \n  A  September report  from the Yale lab found children have been taken to at least 210 locations, including military bases, orphanages and camps, where they have been reeducated in alignment with pro-Russian narratives and in some cases trained for combat. Many of them have had their identities changed, making them increasingly difficult to track over time.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady’s language ignores the reality of the situation — and could play in Putin’s favor, some advocates for the children told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Bill Taylor, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, applauded Melania Trump’s personal involvement while also noting that Putin likely has ulterior motives.\n \n\n   \n  “Every returned child is wonderful for that family and that child, so that is good. But there are more than 19,000 of these, and I do think that Putin is cynically using this in an attempt to make the Trumps more sympathetic to him,” Taylor told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The estimates of how many children have been allegedly abducted vary, depending on the source and who’s being counted.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump, a day after a  two-hour phone call  with the Russian leader last week, offered his own take on the number. “Some people say it’s 20,000 and some people say it’s 300,” he said during his Friday meeting with Zelensky at the White House. “So, nobody really knows, but she felt very strongly about the children.”\n \n\n   \n  Taylor doesn’t doubt Melania Trump’s compassion for the Ukrainian children — but he does question the Russian leader’s.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the first lady is genuinely interested in getting the Ukrainian children home. But the fact is that Putin is not. He could return all of these kids and end the war tomorrow if he wanted,” Taylor said.\n \n\n   \n  Melania Trump’s efforts came amid mounting pressure from the Ukrainians, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers and evangelicals to get the Trump administration involved in returning the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska, for example,  traveled to New York  last month with a pressing mission to raise awareness among the international community. Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, she warned that at the current rate, it would take 50 years to return the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  The American first lady, who employs a skeletal staff, kept the news of the eight children’s release to an extremely small circle of aides before revealing it publicly, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Some Ukrainians at the working level who have been focused on the issue were taken aback by the first lady’s involvement. They welcomed her efforts, but worried about Putin working with her only as part of an effort to downplay the enormity of the problem, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian official dismissed those concerns and said Volodymyr Zelensky was grateful for the US first lady’s intervention.\n \n\n   \n  In her initial announcement, Trump said she and Putin “have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children for the past three months.” She pointed to backchannel meetings and calls following a letter she wrote to the Russian leader, hand-delivered by her husband in  Alaska in August , that obliquely referenced the “darkness” around children impacted by war.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, a group of key Senate Republicans and Democrats had been pushing for a  resolution  making the return of the abducted children a prerequisite for any negotiated peace agreement to end the war. But despite the first lady’s announcement, the White House has not yet stated a position on the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  While one Republican congressional aide said there is some skepticism regarding Melania Trump’s involvement, for now, there is no appetite on Capitol Hill to push the White House on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  “If there needs to be conversations with the White House on this, there will be, but I have no indication that Melania believes what Putin says,” the aide said, adding that there are some concerns about Putin using a direct line to the first lady to shift the narrative on the allegedly abducted children.\n \n\n   \n  Evangelical groups that have lobbied the White House and the first lady’s office on the issue praised Trump’s receptiveness and argued that the return of eight children was an important turning point.\n \n\n   \n  And Chelsea Sobolik, director of government relations at World Relief, an evangelical humanitarian organization, noted that the effort also marked a critical recognition from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Up until recently, Russia was denying this issue — or they were giving all these false narratives. So I think the fact that this is making waves at the top levels of our US government does mean there’s movement. I view this as a first step, not a last step. There’s so much more work that needs to be done,” Sobolik said.\n \n\n   \n  She signed onto a letter from a group of evangelical leaders thanking Trump — but also encouraging her to keep her foot on the gas.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to urge the Trump Administration to ensure that this remains a central issue and that all estimated 35,000 children are returned as a precondition to any peace talks,” they  wrote .\n \n\n   \n   This headline has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/09/16/science/earth-quasi-moon-2025-pn7","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00-04:00","title":"Astronomers discover previously unknown quasi-moon near Earth","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Astronomers have discovered a previously unknown quasi-moon, 2025 PN7, which has orbited near Earth for approximately 60 years and was first detected by the Pan-STARRS observatory in Hawaii on August 29, 2025.

 10:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Astronomers have spotted a quasi-moon near Earth — and the small space rock has likely been hanging out near our planet unseen by telescopes for about 60 years, according to new research.\n \n\n   \n  The newly discovered celestial object, named 2025 PN7, is a type of near-Earth asteroid that orbits the sun but sticks close to our planet. Like our world, 2025 PN7 takes one year to complete an orbit around the sun.\n \n\n   \n  Quasi-moons differ from temporary mini-moons that occasionally orbit Earth such as  2024 PT5 , which circled the planet for two months in 2024 and could be an ancient fragment that was blasted off of our primary moon.\n \n\n   \n  The newly found 2025 PN7 is just one of a handful of known quasi-moons with orbits near our planet, including  Kamo‘oalewa , which is also thought to be an ancient lunar fragment. Kamo‘oalewa is one of the destinations of  China’s Tianwen-2 mission  launched in May, which aims to collect and return samples from the space rock in 2027. Currently, there are seven known quasi-satellites near Earth, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  The Pan-STARRS observatory located on the Haleakala volcano in Hawaii captured observations of 2025 PN7 on August 29. Archival data revealed that the object has been in an Earth-like orbit for decades.\n \n\n   \n  The quasi-moon managed to escape the notice of astronomers for so long because it is small and faint, said Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, a researcher on the faculty of mathematical sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid who recently authored a paper about the space rock. The paper was published on   September 2 in the journal  Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society , which is for timely non-peer-reviewed astronomical observations.\n \n\n   \n  The space rock swings within 186,000 miles (299,337 kilometers) of us during its closest pass of our planet,   de la Fuente Marcos said. For reference, 2025 PN7 is 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth on average, according to  NASA .\n \n\n   \n  “It can only be detected by currently available telescopes when it gets close to our planet as it did this summer,” de la Fuente Marcos explained. “Its visibility windows are few and far between. It is a challenging object.”\n \n\n   \n  Finding and studying quasi-moons can reveal more about our corner of the universe, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Solar System is full of surprises so we keep looking,” he wrote in an email. “For Earth’s neighborhood, the existence of 2025 PN7 suggests that there may not exist a lower limit to the size of a quasi-satellite.”\n \n\n   \n    A temporary companion\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are still trying to figure out 2025 PN7’s size. About 98 feet (30 meters) across is a reasonable estimate, de la Fuente Marcos said. It also has the potential to be 62 feet (19 meters) in diameter, according to  EarthSky .\n \n\n   \n  The space rock is currently the smallest-known quasi-moon to have orbited near Earth, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, 2025 PN7 switches between a closer, more circular Earthlike orbit and a horseshoe orbit, similar to Kamoʻoalewa’s. During the horseshoe orbit, the space rock can reach a distance of 185 million miles (297 million kilometers) from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  The quasi-moon is expected to remain in its current near-Earth orbit for about another 60 years before the gravitational tug of the sun pulls it back into a horseshoe orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Questions remain about the space rock’s composition, which is currently unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on what little we know so far, it’s almost certainly a rocky and natural object — sometimes old satellites and rocket junk end up in these very-near-Earth kinds of orbits, but we can often tell ‘natural’ (e.g., asteroidal) from ‘artificial’ (e.g., satellite) based on how their orbits evolve on short timescales,” wrote Dr. Teddy Kareta, assistant professor in the department of astrophysics and planetary science at Villanova University, in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Kareta, who has previously studied mini-moons and quasi-moons, was not involved in the research   and said   bad weather has thus far interfered with his plans to observe it.\n \n\n   \n  While 2025 PN7, like Kamoʻoalewa, may also be a piece of the moon, more data is needed to confirm that, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  De la Fuente Marcos believes that 2025 PN7 came from the Arjuna asteroid belt. Unlike the main asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the Arjuna asteroid is not a distinct belt. Instead, they are a group of small space rocks that have orbits around the sun similar to Earth’s.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, de la Fuente Marcos had proposed that mini-moon 2024 PT5 was also an Arjuna asteroid that could have come from Earth’s moon before becoming part of the belt.\n \n\n   \n  “Now we know that material ejected during lunar impacts may contribute members to the Arjuna secondary asteroid belt,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though   quasi-moons and mini-moons can closely approach our planet, they don’t typically pose an impact risk for Earth,   so 2025 PN7 is no threat, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Sending missions to investigate quasi-moons, as Tianwen-2 is expected to do with Kamoʻoalewa, could reveal the true origin and history of these intriguing space rocks — and provide other opportunities as well, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “These asteroids are relatively easy to access for unmanned missions and can be used to test planetary exploration technologies with a relatively modest investment,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/climate/extreme-weather-disaster-trump-noaa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump ‘retired’ a database tracking the most expensive weather disasters.

expensive weather disasters. Now it’s back — and finding over $100B in losses \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters Database, which the Trump administration  “retired” in May , has relaunched outside of the government using the same methodology. In its first update at the new site, the database shows that the first six months of 2025 have been the most expensive first six months of any year since 1980.\n \n\n   \n  The Billion-Dollar Database tracks the financial costs of property and other infrastructure destroyed by extreme weather disasters in the United States, focusing on events that caused $1 billion or more in damages. So far, 2025 has racked up $101.4 billion in such losses. The climate research nonprofit Climate Central  now hosts the database  and makes this information available to insurers, policy makers, broadcast meteorologists and ordinary citizens.\n \n\n   \n  The database was rebuilt and will be maintained by its previous administrator Adam Smith, a former economist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency which used to host it. Smith found 14 billion-dollar disasters in the first half of this year, including the Los Angeles wildfires in January and a tornado outbreak across the central US in mid-March.   More billion-dollar disasters are likely to be added to the list before 2025 is over.   \n \n\n   \n  Without the database, the public would have no easy way to track the cost of extreme weather events, many of which are becoming more common and severe because of climate change.\n \n\n   \n  But climate change is not the sole reason the database shows an upward trend in both the number of billion-dollar disasters and the amount they cost. Population growth and an increase in the number of buildings in harm’s way are the dominant factors, according to Smith.   \n \n\n   \n  “Either way you look at it, the rise in damages relates to human activities and choices, and so you need to use information in context to better evaluate future choices,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has particularly increased in the last decade, Smith said, occurring nearly twice as often compared to the 30-year inflation-adjusted average.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1980 and 2024, there were nine such disasters on average each year. In the past five years, that annual average has jumped to 24. The  record for a single year  was 28 events in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  In the first six months of 2025, the list of billion-dollar disasters is mostly comprised of severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks, reflecting the conspicuous absence of landfalling hurricanes so far this season.\n \n\n   \n  However, the LA fires in January cost $61.2 billion, making them the costliest wildfires in US history, according to Climate Central.\n \n\n   \n  Climate Central hired Smith after the NOAA economist took early retirement this year, as part of the Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal bureaucracy.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA’s official list stops   at the end of   2024. Climate Central’s version picks up in 2025 and will continue from there.\n \n\n   \n  The relaunched list uses the same methodology as the old NOAA one, Smith said. It relies on data from insurance companies and other sources, some of which is proprietary, to tally up total losses. The decision to discontinue the database was due in part to Smith’s exit from NOAA. It would have been a difficult task for the agency to continue without him, but it could have done it, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The choice to discontinue the database was in keeping with the administration’s focus on cutting climate change datasets and programs across federal agencies. But there were calls for it to continue from multiple sectors.\n \n\n   \n  “This dataset was simply too important to stop being updated. Demand for its revival actually came from several aspects of industry and society, including decision makers in the insurance, reinsurance risk space, academia, Congress and local communities,” Smith said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/sununu-new-hampshire-gop-senate-campaign","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-04:00","title":"Former Sen.

Sununu announced a campaign for US Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators: Republican Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again. I’m a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  National Republicans consider Sununu a strong candidate and one that allows them to go on the offensive as they look to hold their majority in the chamber next year.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in Ohio, Maine and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates. But Republicans are also on the offensive in places like Michigan, Georgia and now, increasingly, New Hampshire — and if they flip one of those seats it will likely put the chamber out of reach for Democrats until at least 2028.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu must first win the primary though, and his past opposition to President Donald Trump could be problematic. While Brown has aligned himself closely with Trump and served as his US ambassador to New Zealand, Sununu backed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, writing an op-ed calling Trump a “loser.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to win New Hampshire’s leadoff primary, but the state’s voters rejected him for a third time in the general election. And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor’s office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire’s congressional seats since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu served three terms in the US House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He was the chamber’s youngest member throughout his term, a fact he emphasized in a 2008 campaign ad that showed him sprinting up a steep mountain path.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s younger, faster, quicker,” a deep-voiced (and somewhat redundant) narrator intones. “Inexhaustible. Tireless. Energetic.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s now the same age Shaheen was when she defeated him and is 16 years older than US Rep. Chris Pappas, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security.\n \n\n   \n  Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Chris Pappas will stand up to corporate special interests and take on anyone to do what is best for New Hampshire, and that’s why Granite Staters will elect him to the US Senate next November,” campaign manager Rachel Petri said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Though Sununu has long been out of office, his name recognition remains high due to his family’s political prominence. His father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor and former White House chief of staff. One of his brothers,  Chris Sununu, served four terms as governor  and flirted with a Senate campaign of his own in 2021. He also shot down a bid this cycle, saying he had spoken to the White House but opted against it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/serbia-parliament-shots-fired-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:38:00-04:38","title":"Man seriously injured after shots fired outside Serbian parliament","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man was seriously injured on October 22, 2025, when shots were fired outside Serbia’s parliament building in Belgrade, near a tent camp established by supporters of President Aleksander Vucic.

Here’s where the race stands so far \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:26 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Where has 2025 gone? One way to mark the dizzying elapsing of time: The  Oscar  race is already coming into focus, now that we’re –  gulp  – three months out from nominations.\n \n\n   \n  The competition still has much time to take shape, but there are a few frontrunners emerging, starting with Paul Thomas Anderson’s recently released chaotic opus “One Battle After Another” – which has enjoyed the best word of mouth this year, notching an impressive critic score of 95 on both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. (“One Battle After Another” is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n \n\n   \n  But not far behind are several other titles, including many yet to be released, like “Sentimental Value,” “Marty Supreme,” “Hamnet,” “Bugonia” and “Wicked: For Good,” to name a few.\n \n\n   \n  A preliminary breakdown of top categories follows:\n \n\n   \n    Best picture\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 15 years since the Academy opened up this race to more than the previously fixed number of five nominees – vacillating between eight and ten best picture contenders, and  settling consistently on ten  for the last few years. This year, that leaves the field open to quite a few possibilities. First, there’s “One Battle After Another,” whose director Anderson has frequently attracted Oscar love over the years and is seemingly a shoe-in for scoring a nomination for the night’s top honor. Ryan Coogler’s period-horror hit “Sinners” (also a Warner Bros. Pictures production) is also a solid contender, despite coming out in the summer months, which is a window often overlooked by Academy voters.\n \n\n   \n  At this juncture, other buzzy films generating a fair amount of Oscar buzz are the English-, Norwegian- and Swedish-language “Sentimental Value” (out on November 7) starring Stellan Skarsgård and Elle Fanning, “Hamnet” (out November 27) featuring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and “Marty Supreme” (out on Christmas Day) with Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Let us also not overlook the Palme d’Or-winning  Iranian film “It was Just an Accident,”  out this month.\n \n\n   \n  In the “maybe…could be…you never know!” section, there’s summer actioner “F1,” Netflix’s “Jay Kelly” with George Clooney and  Guillermo del Toro-directed “Frankenstein.”  These are probably in the long-shot category, but hey, Hollywood loves a twist.\n \n\n   \n    Best actress\n \n\n   \n  The Academy certainly favors return nominees, but it also  can’t resist a new arrival . This year, look for newcomer Chase Infiniti – whose quietly explosive performance is at the center of “One Battle After Another” – to be in the conversation. And although not a newbie on the scene, acclaimed Norwegian performer Renate Reinsve could have a place in the race for her work as the resentful daughter of an estranged director in “Sentimental Value,” which would mark her first Oscar nod.\n \n\n   \n  As for returning favorites, there’s Buckley, who was nominated for best supporting actress in 2022 for “The Lost Daughter,” and is all but sure to receive one again this year for her lead role in Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” playing a grief-stricken mother and wife to one William Shakespeare (Mescal). It would also be a major upset if Cynthia Erivo isn’t again recognized for her performance as Elphaba in the sequel “Wicked: For Good,” even though the film has yet to be screened for most anyone.\n \n\n   \n  Other possible contenders who are not new to the Oscar race include Amanda Seyfried in “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Julia Roberts in “After the Hunt,” “Bugonia’s” Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence for “Die My Love.”\n \n\n   \n    Best actor\n \n\n   \n  Let’s assume we’re reserving one chair for “One Battle’s” Leonardo DiCaprio – already an Oscar-winner for 2015’s “The Revenant.” That leaves us four slots to play with in the best actor race.\n \n\n   \n  Actually, make that three, because “Narcos” actor Wagner Moura, who is making waves for his work in the Brazilian film “The Secret Agent,” already won best actor at Cannes for the espionage thriller. In the film, he plays a technology expert in late-’70s Recife who discovers he’s being targeted by some unsavory characters. Notable: Only  16 best actor winners from the ritzy Cannes fest  have gone on to be nominated for an Academy Award.\n \n\n   \n  The three other spots could go several ways. Michael B. Jordan, who plays twins with very different fates in “Sinners,” and Chalamet, who would be returning for a second consecutive Oscar nomination (and his third in total), are strong options.\n \n\n   \n  On their heels, however, might be “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White, whose portrayal of Bruce Springsteen in “Deliver Me from Nowhere” has certainly  generated press  and some voter buzz. Other potential nominees include   Dwayne Johnson for “The Smashing Machine,” Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon” – in which  he plays Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart  – and Jesse Plemons for his turn as a wild conspiracy theorist in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia.”\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actress\n \n\n   \n  The best supporting actress race is a tough one to predict, since as usual, there’s just so much to choose from. Amy Madigan, known to most for ’80s films like “Uncle Buck” and “Field of Dreams,” turned out a bonkers performance in this summer’s breakout elevated horror hit “Weapons” (also from Warner Bros.) and has appeared on several lists as a favorite to be nominated here. It would mark her second Oscar nomination in this same category in exactly 40 years, after 1985’s “Twice in a Lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  While horror doesn’t often get recognized by the Academy, the precedent has indeed been set – Ruth Gordon won Oscar gold in 1969 for playing a somewhat similar character in “Rosemary’s Baby,” and landmark genre films like “The Exorcist” and “Aliens” also received Academy recognition for the actresses who starred in those films.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of that, keep your eyes on Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall, who each shine in “One Battle After Another,” and Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas for their work in “Sentimental Value.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s too early to count out Ariana Grande, who will again portray Glinda in the upcoming “Wicked: For Good,” especially if the movie ends up being great.\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actor\n \n\n   \n  If Sean Penn gets a nomination for his mercenary-like villain Colonel Lockjaw in “One Battle,” he could very well end up joining an elite group of three-time Oscar winners that includes Meryl Streep, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jack Nicholson and Frances McDormand.\n \n\n   \n  But “Hamnet’s”   Mescal, a returning nominee following 2022’s “Aftersun,” also has a strong chance.   While several actors have gotten nominated for playing roles in films based on Shakespeare’s works, no one has been nominated for playing the man himself. (Yes, 1998’s “Shakespeare in Love” was showered with Academy love, but the Bard-playing actor Joseph Fiennes was not nominated.)\n \n\n   \n  Other potential contenders in this category could include Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value,” Adam Sandler for Netflix’s “Jay Kelly,” and Jeremy Strong – who was nominated last year for his chilling portrayal of Roy Cohn in “The Apprentice” – for “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere.”\n \n\n   \n  Oscar nominations will be unveiled on the morning of January 22, 2026. The 98th Academy Awards will be held on March 15.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/bessent-argentina-lifeline-warren","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Bessent calls $20 billion lifeline to Argentina a ‘mission-critical’ function of Treasury during shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the Treasury Department’s decision to provide a $20 billion currency swap to Argentina during a federal government shutdown, calling it a mission-critical function necessary for global financial stability.

during the government shutdown was an essential action for the agency, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  His remarks came in response to a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, who wrote to Bessent a week prior requesting an explanation as to why the Treasury Department was working on the Argentinian lifeline during a shutdown of the federal government that has restrained resources.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been forced to prioritize mission-critical efforts necessary to the discharge of the President’s constitutional duties — including national security and global financial stability,” Bessent wrote to Warren, in a letter the senator shared exclusively with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent  announced earlier this month  is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity. Effectively, though, it’s a loan from the US government.\n \n\n   \n  The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he’ll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month. Trump said last week future efforts to boost the Argentine economy would be contingent on the election results.\n \n\n   \n  But on top of questions Trump has faced on the rationale for an economic rescue of the South American country, a looming concern is whether the efforts have been successful.\n \n\n   \n  While the Argentine peso initially rose following Bessent’s announcement, the currency set a fresh low earlier this week, suggesting more work could be needed to stabilize it.\n \n\n   \n  Warren also questioned Treasury’s plans to work with private-sector banks to generate a $20 billion loan to Argentina on top of the $20 billion rescue package from the government.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent, in his response, did not directly address her questions regarding private-sector involvement.

Jesse Jackson Sr., a civil rights leader and political outsider, ran for president in two groundbreaking campaigns that changed American politics. A son of the segregated South who went from nothing to eventually becoming one of the most well-known public figures in America, Jackson’s outsider political campaigns challenged the Democratic Party to reform its nominating process, more equitably include women and non-white voters, and appeal to Americans on a platform of economic populism. \n \n\n   \n   In 1984, Jackson lost the nomination but started a movement he called the “Rainbow Coalition.” By 1988, Jackson was a force to be reckoned with. This time, he faced a crowded primary of established political hands. The race, led by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, was heated from the beginning. Jackson, a polarizing but outsized figure, was a magnet for media attention. In both 1984 and 1988, Jackson appealed to Black voters in the South, who formed a critical voting bloc in the Democratic primary. But this time, his appeal among white voters was growing as well. In March 1988, Jackson came from behind to win the Michigan Democratic caucuses and set off a panic in his party. For the first time, the party and Jackson himself, began contemplating: What would happen if he became the Democratic nominee for president? \n \n\n   \n   Below is an excerpt from Abby Phillip’s  new book , “A Dream Deferred,” which publishes on October 28.  \n \n\n   \n  Jesse Jackson convened half a dozen of his closest advisers in his Chicago home. For the first time, he was beginning to lay out what he would have to do to build an actual presidency if he were to become the nominee.\n \n\n   \n  There was plenty of fear, too. In his own mind, the gravity of the presidency — or the potential of it — descended on him all at once. This was the same man who wore a bulletproof jacket provided to him by the Secret Service as a matter of course during both his campaigns. But for the first time, he was discussing with his closest aides what they would do about cabinet positions and White House appointments.\n \n\n   \n  “He was seriously thinking for the first time, ‘Wait a second, this could be doable,’” recalled campaign manager Jerry Austin, a white Jewish man from New York  with a long history of political campaigns in the heartland.\n \n\n   \n  “By that time, we had some momentum, and the issues that we raised were resonating,” Jackson said. “Our issues were on time, issues about economic justice and shared economic security, a connection between family farms and urban workers, how blacks and whites had to relate together, and browns. So, it was in full gear. We used to call it ‘poor campaign, rich message.’ Our message was winning.”\n \n\n   \n  A similar realization had come to Democratic Party officials, who watched in shock as Jackson beat Dukakis 2–1 in a key industrial midwestern state. The Michigan victory also would, potentially briefly, leave Jackson with an outright delegate lead — a nightmare scenario for some in the party. “The party is up against an extraordinary endgame,” Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told The New York Times. “If this guy has more convention votes than anyone else, how can we not nominate him? But how can we nominate him?”\n \n\n   \n  Others were blunter, though unwilling to put their names on the record. They whispered about denying Jackson the nomination if he entered the convention with the most delegates. “I’m not saying that he can do that,” one anonymous party veteran told the Times. “But if he could, we would be in an impossible situation. We’d have the choice of turning our backs on Jesse, and alienating the Blacks, or nominating him and almost certainly losing in November.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dukakis campaign  was suddenly under the microscope. The Massachusetts governor had plenty going for him organizationally, but almost nothing that gripped the hearts of primary voters. “We must acknowledge the strength of Jackson’s message,” one of Dukakis’s supporters, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, said. On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers were skeptical about Dukakis the man and the uninspiring campaign he was running. Even if they wanted to “stop Jackson,” they were trapped. They were deathly afraid of being called racist for opposing a Black candidate but were convinced that if Jackson were the nominee, the Republicans would run away with the race in historic fashion.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They were buying into his campaign’\n \n\n   \n  The relationship between Jackson and Austin, his campaign manager, had been cordial but uneasy until this point. Unlike many people around Jackson, Austin was not a longtime loyalist. Yet the victory in Michigan seemed to act as a pressure valve releasing some of the distrust Jackson may have felt for Austin—at least temporarily.\n \n\n   \n  The campaign finally seemed to be getting its footing. With Austin’s arrival and a more sophisticated finance team being brought on, Jackson was well positioned to take advantage of the financial windfalls that came from his better-than-expected performance on Super Tuesday. He was continuing to run, by far, the leanest of the campaigns still in the field. But the sudden uptick in fundraising among smaller donations and larger checks caught the attention of his rivals. The campaign began using mail solicitations to fundraise. And with each campaign victory, raising money from wealthy donors became easier.\n \n\n   \n  On that front, Jackson was playing catch-up with the other, more establishment candidates in the race. But where none of them could touch his candidacy was with his small-dollar appeal. It was one of the great gifts Jackson had, taken straight from the pulpit. At rallies and campaign events in churches and high school gyms, the ask would start at a thousand dollars. Could anyone spare a thousand? Not one hand in the room went up—nor did Jackson expect that any would. The ask then went down to five hundred, then to fifty, then twenty and ten, until virtually every hand in the room was raised and people put what they had into the collection hat.\n \n\n   \n  “Afterward, I said to him, ‘Why do you start asking for a thousand? There’s nobody in this church with a thousand dollars,’” Austin recalled. “And he said, ‘When I get to “Who will give me something?” everybody would give me something.’”\n \n\n   \n  “They were buying into his campaign,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n    Tranquilizing the establishment\n \n\n   \n  It was past time for Jackson to begin to calm the nerves of the party establishment in Washington. With the help of former DNC chairman John C. White and Bert Lance, former budget director for President Jimmy Carter, the campaign gathered around thirty-five Democrats representing a cross section of fundraisers, party officials, and tastemakers in a ballroom at the Jefferson Hotel in DC. Jackson worked the room. The aim was to “raise the comfort level” of party officials. One attendee called it a “tranquilizer” for the Democratic Party chattering class.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of those kinds of people wind up making up public opinion in a very small subset,” said Ann Lewis. “This was about, at the most basic level, relieving people’s anxiety because I consistently thought Jesse had been so underestimated and not quite caricatured, but unfairly portrayed by the press. … And for people to see him as he really was, which was this smart, thoughtful guy and someone who really wanted the Democratic Party to succeed. They didn’t know that.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson was buoyant as he went into Wisconsin ahead of its April 5 primary. The crowds seemed to validate the growing interest in his candidacy. He and his campaign were confident that he could appeal to the state’s college towns and urban communities. Jackson had high hopes for the state, where his rallies had been enthusiastically received even in white farming communities.\n \n\n   \n  They held a rally on the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Paul Wellstone, who would later become a progressive US senator from Minnesota, was Jackson’s state director there. A crowd nearly the size of the town’s population of 2,800 showed up in rural Amery, Wisconsin, to hear Jackson speak. As they gathered on the Blu-Fay dairy farm, there was almost as much appreciation for Jackson showing up there as for his message. “The truly impressive thing is here’s a Black man coming up to rural Wisconsin, to a community where all the Blacks could fill that barn, and there would still be a lot of room,” said Skip Shireman, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher.\n \n\n   \n  There was interest, no doubt, in Jackson’s candidacy and message, but the campaign was ill-equipped to capture that curiosity and transform it into votes. There were memorable messages, to be sure — “We will choose farms over arms in this generation” — but Jackson was characteristically short on specifics. If anything, his candidacy was beginning to be a repository for disenchantment with the rest of the Democratic field. “The man has something to say,” said Bob Jahnke, an electric plant worker who came out to see Jackson. “We had (US Rep. Dick) Gephardt and Dukakis here last Saturday. Gephardt had somewhat of a message, but Dukakis didn’t say much.”\n \n\n   \n  In more moderate La Crosse, old party hands who had thrown their support behind Dukakis or Gore found discord in their own homes. “My mother is voting for Jesse Jackson, my sister is voting for Jesse Jackson,” a state representative who had thrown his hat in for Gore told a reporter. “I can’t even convince my own family to vote for Al Gore.”\n \n\n   \n  The energy around Jackson’s candidacy was unmistakable and set his opponents’ more traditional campaigns in stark relief. As the April 5 primary approached, Dukakis was feeling the pressure to better define himself and his candidacy in the minds of uninspired voters. “I have no interest in being known as the Great Communicator,” he said. “I want to be known as the Great Builder. I want to make the American dream come alive again.” \n \n\n   \n    Electability concerns win out\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s growing populist appeal was rising just as rapidly as the panic among establishment Democrats and the party faithful. A U.S. News & World Report poll put a Jackson-led presidential ticket far behind Vice President George H.W. Bush in a general election. Meanwhile, a Dukakis-led ticket with Jackson as vice president would narrowly beat Bush. The survey quantified persistent reservations among the electorate about Jackson’s candidacy. Those two forces came crashing together in spectacular fashion on Election Night in Wisconsin.\n \n\n   \n  Thanks to Michigan, the expectations were sky high for Jackson. Austin’s strategy banked on defying expectations by overperforming among white voters in a state where Jackson could not necessarily rely on a large Black vote for credibility. But the Michigan victory changed all that. It refocused attention in the media on the question of “electability” and set victory as the standard that Jackson had to meet.\n \n\n   \n  By Election Day, the tides had turned, and Dukakis pulled out a decisive victory.\n \n\n   \n  “We got creamed,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of securing an easy victory that his large, enthusiastic crowds suggested, Jackson finished second. In a poll around the primary, about a third of primary voters said management skills and the candidate’s experience were the main factors that determined their vote—and that group overwhelmingly supported Dukakis.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin was “the end of the hope that you might actually have this miracle take place,” Borosage said. Dukakis’s message of “competence not charisma” worked. Jackson performed better with white voters, but any momentum he was hoping for after Michigan was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “In Wisconsin there were people who would have voted for Jesse but didn’t want him to be the nominee because they didn’t think he could win,” Austin said. “Dukakis was a safe haven.”\n \n\n   \n   Despite a groundswell of grassroots support for Jackson’s insurgent campaign, it was never matched by elected Democrats and party leaders. Jackson finished second to Dukakis in the 1988 primary but secured leverage at the Democratic National Convention. He used it to push through a series of changes to the Democratic Party’s platform and rules, including one that would become pivotal in another primary where a Black candidate, Barack Obama, sought the nomination against a more establishment figure. Jackson hoped that he would be considered seriously as running mate to Dukakis. The two men and their wives met at Dukakis’ Brookline, Massachusetts, home in the lead-up to the convention. But ultimately, Dukakis chose a white Southerner, Sen.  Lloyd Bentsen  of Texas. After a sharply negative general election campaign against Vice President George H.W. Bush, Dukakis lost in an electoral landslide. \n \n\n   \n   The headline on this story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/los-angeles-immigration-us-marshal-injured","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:43:00-04:00","title":"US Marshal and Undocumented Immigrant Injured in Shooting During ICE Stop in Los Angeles","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 22, 2025, a federal marshal and undocumented immigrant Carlitos Ricardo Parias were injured during an ICE enforcement operation in South Los Angeles.

By Josh Campbell, Alex Stambaugh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:43 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal marshal and an undocumented immigrant were injured Tuesday after an agent’s weapon discharged during an immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors allege a man, identified as Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a 44-year-old Mexican national living in South Los Angeles, rammed law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to dislodge his car during an immigration arrest.\n \n\n   \n  He has been charged with assault on a federal officer, according to a  statement  from the US Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California. He is expected to appear in the US district court on Thursday in Los Angeles, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators believe gunfire erupted after an ICE officer confronted the suspect’s vehicle and smashed a window with their service weapon, a law enforcement source said. While attempting to grab the suspect, authorities believe the agent’s weapon discharged, striking both the suspect and a deputy US marshal.\n \n\n   \n  Parias, a popular TikTok streamer, has frequently documented ICE traffic stops and immigration enforcement operations around Los Angeles on his account, Richard LA, which had more than 133,000 followers as of Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Parias was “shot in the elbow and one law enforcement officer was shot in the hand by a ricochet bullet. Both are in hospital,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The injured marshal, who was not named, was in stable condition, the US Marshals Central District of California said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Both Parias and the deputy marshal are expected to recover,” the US attorney’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Before the shooting, an administrative immigration arrest warrant had been issued for Parias and federal agents had set up surveillance on a block in South Los Angeles to monitor his movements, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  The agents saw Parias leave a home and drive away in a gray Toyota Camry, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  When three law enforcement agents boxed in Parias’ car and ordered him to exit the vehicle, Parias “ignored those commands and drove the Camry both forward and back, hitting two of the law enforcement vehicles” before “accelerating aggressively” with the car, prosecutors said, citing an affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  “All these factors, including the large amount of smoke produced by the spinning of the Camry’s tires, caused the agents on scene to fear that Parias would successfully dislodge the Camry … and injure them,” the US attorney’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI are investigating the incident, with assistance from several federal offices, including ICE, the US Marshals Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n \n\n   \n  “Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,” DHS said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles City Councilmember Curren Price has voiced support for Parias, describing him in an  Instagram  post as “a pillar of our community, a fearless citizen journalist whose authentic storytelling has consistently uplifted the unheard voices of South-Central Los Angeles.”\n \n\n   \n  His lawyer Carlos Jurado told  CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS  the suspect recorded DHS activity outside his residence on Tuesday morning: “Somehow, in the process of him recording, he was impacted by a bullet in one of his extremities.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very pacifist man.

economic warning sign \n       \n  By Matt Egan, Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:46 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A key group of American borrowers is falling significantly behind on their car loans. It’s yet another sign that the US economy is forming some serious cracks, leaving the most vulnerable in financial distress.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers – those with credit scores below 670 – who are at least 60 days late on their car loans has doubled since 2021 to 6.43%, according to Fitch Ratings. That’s worse than during the past three recessions – during the Covid pandemic, the Great Recession or the dot-com bust.\n \n\n   \n  America’s current subprime delinquency rate is at the second-highest level since the early 1990s. The only time it was higher: this past January. Cars are being repossessed at the highest rate since the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a disturbing trend to economists: Car loans are typically the last payments that Americans are willing to miss. They’re too important to their lives: Cars are essential tools to get to work, drive families and access food.\n \n\n   \n    No room for error\n \n\n   \n   Record car prices  and  high interest rates , combined with other  inflationary pressures , have sent average auto payments to record levels and have put significant stress on car owners.\n \n\n   \n  Although the financial stress on subprime car borrowers has stabilized in 2025 after large increases in late payments and repossessions over the past two years, economists fear what might happen if the  labor market  grows considerably weaker and layoffs become more common.\n \n\n   \n  For subprime borrowers, the default rate – those whose cars have been or are about to be repossessed – which stood at nearly 10% in September, according to Cox Automotive data. That’s down from a year ago but above the long-term average.\n \n\n   \n  Those borrowers often have no choice but to default. They can’t sell their cars because they owe so much more than it is worth. They often have already missed payments on other obligations, such as mortgage payments or rent, as well as payments due on credit cards and student loans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no room for error,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.\n \n\n   \n    Surging costs\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of new car leases and more than three-quarters of new car loans made in the second quarter had monthly payments of $500 or more, and 46% of used car loans have payments of $500 or above, according to Experian. For new car loans, more than 17% have payments of more than $1,000.\n \n\n   \n  Repair costs have also surged – at a time when many are holding onto their cars for longer to avoid splurging on a new one. Motor vehicle  repair costs surged 15%  year-over-year in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s the most in nearly two years. And repair costs increased 5% between July and August, the biggest monthly increase on record.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, car insurance rates have increased significantly since the pandemic. In August, car insurance rose by the smallest annual rate in three years – but that still amounted to a hefty near-5% jump, well above the overall inflation rate.\n \n\n   \n    Consumer pain\n \n\n   \n  The increased costs of owning and maintaining a car aren’t happening in a vacuum: They’re taking place after years of rising prices at the supermarket and across the economy. And two years ago, many  student loan payments  that were paused during the pandemic became due again. A year ago, delinquent student loan payments started counting against credit scores again, pushing some borrowers into lower credit ratings that could raise the rates they were charged on other loans, including car loans.\n \n\n   \n  Elevated subprime delinquency rates demonstrate how beneath the surface of blockbuster stock market returns and strong overall economic growth, many consumers are hurting.\n \n\n   \n  Tellingly, Americans with stronger credit scores don’t appear to be struggling to make car payments. The delinquency rate among prime borrowers has increased significantly but remains very low at less than 0.5%.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no alarm bells going off for prime borrowers,” said Rod Chadehumbe, chief asset backed securities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The wide gap between delinquency rates of prime and subprime borrowers is another reminder of the so called K-shaped economy: Many Americans who have money in the stock market and own increasingly valuable homes are doing well and spending aggressively, but many others, especially lower-income consumers, are struggling to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  A number of lenders who specialize in subprime car loans expect a growing percentage of their clients to default and have their car repossessed, said Pamela Foohey, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in both auto finance and bankruptcies.\n \n\n   \n  The repo business has been quite active lately. Subprime lenders build GPS features into cars to make it easier for teams repossessing the vehicles to find them, she said. The lenders can even disable the ignition of the cars to prevent owners from driving them once they’ve defaulted on the loan.\n \n\n   \n  “The (repo) numbers indicate it’s probably close to the Great Recession in volume,” said George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, and is also president of one of his industry’s trade groups. “It’s a target-rich environment at the moment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/weight-loss-drugs-kff-employer-survey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:10:00-04:00","title":"More and more workers are using weight loss drugs.

are using weight loss drugs. It’s costing their employers a fortune \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.\n \n\n   \n  The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual  Employer Health Benefits Survey , which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.\n \n\n   \n  Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also  limited Americans’ access  to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.\n \n\n   \n  Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.\n \n\n   \n  “Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”\n \n\n   \n  One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32 nd  place last year.\n \n\n   \n  A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”\n \n\n   \n  The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the  medications  would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.\n \n\n   \n  Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.\n \n\n   \n  However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.\n \n\n   \n    Rising premiums\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.\n \n\n   \n  But  coverage for 2026  could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-russell-wilson-sean-payton-criticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:41:00-04:00","title":"Russell Wilson Labels Former Coach Sean Payton 'Classless' After Post-Game Comments","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After the Denver Broncos defeated the New York Giants 33-32 in a dramatic fourth quarter comeback, former coach Sean Payton praised rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, saying the team found a 'spark' in him and noting a change in the Giants' lineup.

head coach Sean Payton “classless” following comments he made after the Denver Broncos’  33-32 victory  over New York on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “Classless… but not surprised… Didn’t realize you’re still bounty hunting 15+ years later through the media,” Wilson  wrote on X  followed by some laughing emojis and the hashtag #LetsRide, a catchphrase he became known for during his time with the Broncos between 2022 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  New York’s backup quarterback was perceived to be responding to comments made by Denver head coach Payton after the Broncos’ dramatic fourth quarter comeback to beat the Giants on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “They found a little spark with that quarterback,”  said Payton , referring to rookie passer Jaxson Dart who replaced Wilson as the Giants’ starter after the team began the season 0-3.\n \n\n   \n  “I was talking to John Mara not too long ago and I said: ‘We were hoping that that change would’ve happened long after our game,’” Payton added.\n \n\n   \n  Wilson responded by referring to the “Bountygate” scandal which involved Payton’s New Orleans Saints using a  bounty system  between the 2009 and 2011 seasons where players were paid bonuses for, among other things, hard hits and deliberately injuring opposing players.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, Payton was suspended for one year without pay after the NFL found that he was aware of the bounty system and, though not directly involved with it, had done nothing to shut it down.\n \n\n   \n  The squabbling between Wilson and Payton reflects a lingering tension between the two which was born from their time in the Mile High City together.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos went an underwhelming 11-19 in Wilson’s starts over two seasons, failing to make the playoffs in either of them.\n \n\n   \n  Despite throwing for over 3,000 yards with 26 touchdowns during the 2023 season, Wilson was benched after the first 15 games and eventually released in the offseason – with the Broncos taking on a reported  $85 million  in dead salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came amid an injury guarantee in the then 35-year-old’s contract that assured him $37 million if he could not pass a physical on the fifth day of the new league year in March 2024.\n \n\n   \n  By benching Wilson, Denver made sure that he couldn’t get injured and was consequently able to save money on his release.\n \n\n   \n   Speaking to reporters  at the time, Wilson said he was approached by the team after the Broncos’ Week 8 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and told if he didn’t move back his injury guarantee in his contract that he’d be benched.\n \n\n   \n  “We beat the Chiefs. They came up to me at the beginning of the bye week – Monday or Tuesday – and told me that if I didn’t change my contract, my injury guarantee, that I’d be benched for the rest of the year … I was definitely disappointed about it,” said Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t going to take away injury guarantees,” he said. “This game is such a physical game.

They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona.  Mehmet Oz , director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz,  during a television appearance  in August.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a  recent radio appearance  that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs  began under the Biden administration .\n \n\n   \n  And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said  Joan Alker , a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.\n \n\n   \n  “What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  The  Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona , a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.\n \n\n   \n  State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”\n \n\n   \n  One person  doing that development  is Michael Burstein, a software engineer who, until recently, worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called  Digital Public Works  to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”\n \n\n   \n  The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems,  many of which need updating , which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals  roughly four times what it cost  to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.\n \n\n   \n  That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a  temporary extension , despite a  recent report  from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A  complicated sign-up process  has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also allows counties with  high unemployment rates to be exempted , but states must apply for that exemption.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an app that states can use to prove people are eligible for Medicaid, enrollees would still need to know that app existed and how to use it — neither of which is a given, Alker said. There is also no guarantee they’d have reliable cell service or internet access. As  KFF Health News has reported , millions of Americans live in rural areas without reliable internet.\n \n\n   \n  Private vendors also have been working on such apps, said  Jennifer Wagner , who researches Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Wagner said she has seen several vendors demonstrate products they plan to pitch to states for the work rules. Many are limited in scope, she said, like those in the pilot tests.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody has a magical solution that’ll make sure eligible people don’t lose coverage,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/basketball-nba-okc-rockets-warriors-lakers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"NBA Opening Night: OKC wins double-OT thriller against Rockets as they receive championship rings, Warriors topple Lakers","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NBA season opened with two high-stakes games: the Oklahoma City Thunder secured a dramatic double-overtime victory over the Houston Rockets, celebrating their 2024 championship win with rings and a banner, while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the scoring with 35 points.

championship rings, Warriors topple Lakers \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  NBA  is back for another intriguing season and it began in emphatic fashion on Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  On an evening which began with the celebration of the  Oklahoma City Thunder ’s title victory – with players receiving their championship rings and a banner being raised to the rafters of Paycom Center – fans were treated to two exciting games.\n \n\n   \n  First, the Thunder played a double-overtime thriller against the new-look  Houston Rockets , holding on to win 125-124 in an instant classic. And in California, the LeBron James-less Los Angeles Lakers lost their home opener 119-109 to the Golden State Warriors.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know about the two opening games of the 2025 NBA season.\n \n\n   \n    Thunder celebrate title victory, win double-OT classic\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s title victory was the culmination of years of hard work for the Thunder, whether it be through some savvy drafting or creative trades to acquire key pieces.\n \n\n   \n  Those moves all paid off in the form of a dominant regular season and a playoffs which saw Oklahoma City race past most of its opponents, eventually beating the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals in seven games to secure the franchise’s first title since moving from Seattle in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday’s home opener, the victorious Thunder players from last year were serenaded by their fans while receiving their championship rings from Thunder chairman Clay Bennett.\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s  NBA Most Valuable Player , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, was the last to get his ring, with fans chanting “M-V-P!” as he made his way onto the court.\n \n\n   \n  The players then posed for pictures with their new rings – designed by Jostens and which are set in 14-karat gold with more than 800 custom-cut, hand-set gemstones – while the championship banner was raised.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing the banner up there was cool, knowing it’ll be up there forever,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after Tuesday’s game. “Special night.”\n \n\n   \n  After the celebrations were wrapped up, it was time to begin the defense of their crown. First up was the Rockets who, during the offseason, had asserted their own title aspirations by trading for former Thunder star Kevin Durant from the Phoenix Suns.\n \n\n   \n  Durant, 37,  reportedly signed  a two-year extension worth $90 million with the team on Sunday and the move to acquire the 15-time NBA All-Star hints that the franchise is all-in this season.\n \n\n   \n  The game at Paycom Center was a tight affair, with very little to separate the two teams. With 9.5 seconds of regulation time remaining and with the Rockets leading 103-102, Durant had two free throw attempts to potentially put his new team up by three. However, he missed the first and drained the second to give Houston a two-point lead, only for Gilgeous-Alexander to go up the other end and level the score to send it to OT.\n \n\n   \n  Durant almost had another disastrous moment at the end of the first overtime when, with 1.3 seconds left, he caught the ball and signaled for a timeout even though the Rockets didn’t have any left. This usually comes with a one-shot technical free throw for the opposing team but the  officials admitted afterwards  that they missed Durant’s signal and, with the score tied again, the game went to a second overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Ending an action-packed return to OKC for Durant, he played a part in the Thunder eventually securing the victory.\n \n\n   \n  With the Rockets up one, Durant fouled Gilgeous-Alexander with two seconds left, picking up his sixth personal foul and exiting the game. The reigning MVP then hit the two game-winning free throws.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, the new Houston star took responsibility for the defeat.\n \n\n   \n  “I missed the free throws, and I fouled somebody at the end,” Durant, who scored 23 points in 47 minutes, told reporters,  per ESPN . “I think those two plays are the reason we lost.”\n \n\n   \n  Alperen Şengün led the way for the Rockets with 39 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a block while the Thunder were powered by Gilgeous-Alexander’s 35 points and 28 from Chet Holmgren.\n \n\n   \n    Warriors topple Lakers missing LeBron James\n \n\n   \n  In Tuesday’s late game, it was an all-California match-up as the Warriors traveled to the City of Angels to face the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  LA played without superstar LeBron James, who watched from the bench having been  ruled out with sciatica  – an injury which is expected to sideline him until November. It was the first season opener James has missed in his 23 years in the NBA.\n \n\n   \n  In James’ absence, the Lakers were led by  Luka Dončić  who had a ridiculous game with 43 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and a block. Dončić was traded to LA midway through last season in a  blockbuster move .\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t enough as 31 points from Jimmy Butler and 23 from Steph Curry lifted the Warriors to a 119-109 victory.\n \n\n   \n  The two teams were evenly matched at 55-54 at halftime at Crypto.com Arena, but a 19-4 run to open the second half by Golden State led to a 17-point lead.\n \n\n   \n  Austin Reaves – who finished with 26 points and nine assists – did lead a fourth-quarter rally for LA, cutting the Warriors advantage to just six points, but that was as close as the Lakers got with Golden State able to hold on and clinch an impressive road victory.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Dončić said there was no reason to panic for the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there was a lot of positive things tonight, and obviously a lot of things we’ve got to work on,” the Slovenian told reporters. “But my confidence is fine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/simplified-investment-strategy-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00Z","title":"The benefits of keeping your investing life simple","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes a KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart) investment strategy, emphasizing that most actively managed funds fail to outperform low-cost index funds over time.

Because, it turns out, “It’s extremely difficult to beat the market,” said Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, data from Morningstar suggest most actively managed funds don’t.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers compared their performance after fees to a composite of passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds.\n \n\n   \n  “Just 21% of active strategies survived and beat their passive counterparts over the 10 years through June 2025,” they wrote in a  mid-year report  about Morningstar’s Active/Passive Barometer.\n \n\n   \n  As just one example of how actively managed funds may disappoint, Morningstar found that over 20 years, only 7.1% of large cap blend funds – which invest in both growth and value stocks and might compare their performance to the S&P 500 – performed better than index funds in the same category.\n \n\n   \n    Picking the right fund(s) for you\n \n\n   \n  If the bulk of your money is in a workplace retirement plan like a 401(k), chances are you will have the option to invest in a  target-date retirement fund .\n \n\n   \n  Such a fund allocates your money across other stock and bond funds – often index funds – to achieve an allocation that best suits your time horizon to retirement. So for someone who’s 40 they might be in a 2050 or 2055 target date fund.\n \n\n   \n  The fund’s allocation will grow more conservative (less in stocks, more in bonds) as you near your expected retirement year.\n \n\n   \n  “A target date fund can be a great option. It builds in portfolio diversification and an asset mix targeted to your age and retirement date,” Arnott said.\n \n\n   \n  If you don’t have a target date fund, or don’t like the one available in your plan, consider investing instead in three broad index funds and adjust how much you invest in each according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  “The average person probably will get better results with a target-date fund. But if you want a slightly more hands-on approach you could put together a basic portfolio of US and international stocks plus investment-grade bonds. Having exposure to those three asset classes is all you really need,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond retirement, for any investing you’re doing to meet intermediate-term goals with a five- to 10-year horizon, she suggests putting money into a high-quality intermediate-term bond index fund or a low-cost, actively managed one, since this is one arena in which actives have had a reasonably good track record against their benchmarks. Or you might also consider a low-cost, moderate-risk allocation fund of funds – which invests in both stocks and bonds.\n \n\n   \n    The psychological benefits\n \n\n   \n  Just as having fewer but better clothes in an organized closet can reduce your decision fatigue about what to wear, adopting a KISS strategy with just one or a few, low-cost funds can reduce the stress of managing your investments.\n \n\n   \n  With a simple, streamlined portfolio, you’ll know what you’re invested in.\n \n\n   \n  It will be easier to review – which you should do once a year to make sure the way your money is allocated still reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  And your portfolio will be easier to explain to a spouse or adult child, who may help you manage it if you become unable to do so alone, or who will eventually inherit it.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve gotten older and my financial situation has gotten more complicated, I’ve come to appreciate the value of simplicity more,” Arnott said. “There’s a lot of value in having a portfolio that is easier for someone to take over when you’re gone. Or if you’re an  older adult with a cognitive impairment .”\n \n\n   \n  And, perhaps most importantly, having a simpler portfolio may make it easier to assess whether you  need to save  more now. Because no matter how well your investments do, if you aren’t saving sufficiently, the best returns in the world won’t get you where you need to go.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/breast-cancer-invasive-lobular-carcinoma-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:25:00-04:00","title":"What to know about a rapidly rising form of breast cancer that’s hard to detect","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the journal *Cancer* by the American Cancer Society reveals that invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), the second most common type of breast cancer, has increased at a rate nearly four times faster than all other breast cancers combined over the past decade.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Rates of one type of  breast cancer  — invasive lobular carcinoma — have been rising in the United States more than three times faster than those of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade, according to a new study.\n \n\n   \n  This elusive breast cancer that’s hard to spot in routine mammograms is behind more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  The research, published in  Cancer ,  the journal of the American Cancer Society, analyzed national data from 2012 to 2021 and found that rates of invasive lobular carcinoma increased by about 2.8% each year, while rates of all other breast cancer rose by about 0.8% a year.\n \n\n   \n  What exactly is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?\n \n\n   \n  To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.\n \n\n   \n  ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the  National Cancer Institute . About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesn’t change the breast’s structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that don’t show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.\n \n\n   \n  These tests aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.\n \n\n   \n  Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Treatment is similar to that for  other breast cancers . Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age or family history, but many  lifestyle choices  can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.\n \n\n   \n  Regular screening and knowing what’s normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/who-gets-paid-during-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Here’s who gets paid — and who doesn’t — during a federal government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing federal government shutdown beginning October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal employees are either unpaid or furloughed, while lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, judges, and certain appointed officials continue receiving pay under constitutional provisions.

Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the government shutdown, with more than 1 million of them  going unpaid  while Democrats and Republicans in Congress argue over funding federal agencies for the current fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  But those lawmakers on Capitol Hill aren’t missing any paychecks during the impasse, which began October 1, with no end in sight. They continue to receive their salaries, as directed by the  Constitution  – although some have said they wouldn’t accept their pay or will donate the money.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically fall unevenly on those who work for the federal government. And this time, President Donald Trump is taking additional steps to shield — at least temporarily — certain employees and the  military  from the financial pain, even as he threatens that hundreds of thousands of other staffers may never receive the  back pay  guaranteed to them under a 2019 law that he signed.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Senate GOP leaders will put to a vote a bill that would  pay certain essential workers  during the shutdown, though Democrats don’t seem inclined to support the measure unless it applies to all federal staffers who aren’t being paid during the impasse. Some GOP lawmakers are also questioning the effort, saying it would remove one of the  main pressure points  that could help end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  With many federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, missing even one can be financially devastating. Scores of federal employees have written to CNN about the economic toll the shutdown is taking on them and their families, leaving them at risk of losing their homes or cars or making it difficult for them to feed and provide for their families.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who gets paid\n \n\n   \n  In addition to lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and federal judges will still receive their paychecks, thanks to the Constitution. So will political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate, along with certain other appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Also, roughly 830,000 federal workers are continuing to be paid during the impasse, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of shutdown contingency plans filed by agencies. That’s because their compensation doesn’t rely on annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, they are paid through other spending packages, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, through fees or through other resources.\n \n\n   \n  Only days before the roughly 2 million active-duty and reserve members of the military were set to  miss their first paychecks , the Trump administration announced it would use about $8 billion in Pentagon research and development funds to cover the October 15 payroll. But there isn’t enough money for the next distribution at the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Trump administration has  moved to pay  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, according to Kash Patel, the agency’s director. Plus, 70,000 law enforcement personnel in the  Department of Homeland Security , including in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Secret Service and other divisions will receive their paychecks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  posted on X. \n \n\n   \n    Here’s who doesn’t get paid\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while another roughly 670,000 have been furloughed, according to the latest estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. However, agencies have made changes as the shutdown drags on. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service originally said it would use the Inflation Reduction Act to keep paying all of its roughly 74,300 employees but a week later decided to  furlough nearly half its workforce .\n \n\n   \n   Senate staffers  learned Friday that they will not receive their October 20 paychecks and won’t be paid for the remainder of the shutdown, while the judicial branch announced that it has run out of funding to sustain full operations. Essential staff will stay on the job, working without pay, while other court employees will be furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, federal workers typically received back pay when impasses ended, but Congress made it official in 2019. However, the White House budget office is considering a new interpretation of that law, arguing it doesn’t cover furloughed employees.\n \n\n   \n  Many  federal contractors , including those who handle security, clean offices and staff the cafes in federal buildings, are also laid off during shutdowns. But unlike federal workers, they have no guarantee of being made whole at the end of the impasse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump-visit-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:44:00Z","title":"North Korea test-fires ballistic missiles ahead of Trump’s Asia trip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile test in five months on October 22, 2025, launching short-range missiles from south of Pyongyang that flew 350 kilometers toward the northeast without landing in the sea. The test occurs just days before U.S. President Donald Trump’s Asia trip, during which he is expected to meet with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Chinese President Xi Jinping. South Korea and Japan, through real-time intelligence sharing, are monitoring the situation, with Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi emphasizing coordinated defense efforts.

President Donald Trump and other leaders are expected to meet in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military said it detected multiple short-range ballistic missiles that were launched from an area south of Pyongyang and flew about 350 kilometers (220 miles) toward the northeast. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t release more specific flight details but said the missiles didn’t land in the sea.\n \n\n   \n  The Joint Chiefs added that the South’s military remains ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on its solid military alliance with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s new Prime Minister  Sanae Takaichi  told reporters that Tokyo was closely communicating with Washington and Seoul, including by sharing real-time missile warning data. North Korea didn’t immediately comment on the launches.\n \n\n   \n   Trump is to leave for Asia  at the end of the week in the first trip to the region of his second term. He plans to go to Malaysia first for a regional summit, and then head to Japan before travelling on to South Korea for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, an annual summit meant to promote economic integration and trade.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was expected to visit the South Korean city of Gyeongju ahead of the summit for bilateral meetings with leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, but South Korean officials say Trump won’t likely attend APEC’s main conference set for Oct. 30-Nov. 1.\n \n\n   \n  Experts earlier said North Korea could conduct provocative missile tests before or during the APEC summit to underscore its commitment to gain recognition as a nuclear weapons state. Experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would need that status to call for the U.N. to lift the economic sanctions punishing it for its weapons program.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s ballistic missile launches by North Korea were the first of their kind since the country on May 8 tested short-range systems that simulated nuclear counterstrikes against US and South Korean forces. They were also North Korea’s first ballistic missile testing activities since Lee took office in June with a promise to push to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has been sharply accelerating the pace of weapons tests since his high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over the US-led economic sanctions. But last month, Kim suggested he could return to talks if the US drops its demand for North Korea’s denuclearization, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Kim displayed  a new intercontinental ballistic missile  at a military parade attended by Chinese, Russian and other top officials. The parade highlighted Kim’s growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build a reliable arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the US and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s state media said the Oct. 10 parade featured the Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, which it described as the country’s “most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.” Observers said the new ICBM is designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat US missile defenses and that North Korea could test-launch it in coming months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/world/canada-election-carney-quebec-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00.000Z","title":"A blunder meant this voter’s ballot wasn’t counted – then her pick lost by one vote.

The Bloc Québécois have 22 seats.\n \n\n   \n  Carney won the election in a  stunning comeback  for his party,  abetted by US President Donald Trump’s threats  to enact sweeping tariffs on Canada and annex the country as the 51st US state.\n \n\n   \n  But Bloc Québécois incumbent Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné challenged the result, after a voter came forward to say her mail-in ballot, which she had cast for her, had not been counted.\n \n\n   \n  Terrebonne resident Emmanuelle Bossé  told public broadcaster CBC Radio-Canada  in May her ballot was returned to sender because of an incorrect postal code on the return envelope provided by the national elections commission.\n \n\n   \n  According to statements filed in the case at the province’s top court, an Elections Canada employee discovered he had mistakenly printed his own postal code on dozens of ballots in the lead-up to election day, according to the Canadian Press news agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t the one who got Elections Canada’s address wrong on the envelope,” Bossé told Radio-Canada. “Elections Canada glued this label on the envelope.”\n \n\n   \n  Bossé said she was upset her vote hadn’t been counted, especially given how close the race was.\n \n\n   \n  “I voted for the Bloc,” Bossé told Radio-Canada. “So it was maybe the vote that could have changed something.”\n \n\n   \n  The election result was muddled from the start. Auguste was initially projected to win the seat by just 35 votes. But following a standard validation process, Terrebonne went to Sinclair-Desgagné by 44 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The tight race triggered a judicial recount – required by law for any race won by a margin of less than 0.1%. Following the recount, Auguste was renamed the winner on May 10 with a total of 23,352 votes – just one more than Sinclair-Desgagné.\n \n\n   \n  In Quebec’s Superior Court this week, lawyers for both candidates put forward competing arguments over whether the result should be upheld, or if a new election should be called.\n \n\n   \n  Sinclair-Desgagné’s lawyer Stéphane Chatigny told the court Monday that solidifying the election result would “send a disastrous message to voters” and “undermine public confidence,” according to Canadian Press.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Auguste’s lawyer Marc-Étienne Vien said cancelling the result would “deny the right to vote” of the tens of thousands of Terrebonne residents that cast their ballots in April.\n \n\n   \n  David Baum, lawyer for Elections Canada, told the court elections are “not designed to achieve perfection,” according to the Canadian Press.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big, complex machine, and errors are inevitable,” Baum said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/us/united-cockpit-window-weather-balloon-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00Z","title":"United flight’s cockpit window may have been struck by weather balloon, company says","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A United Airlines Boeing 737 flight (Flight 1093) traveling from Denver to Los Angeles experienced a cracked cockpit window after a suspected collision with a weather balloon, leading to a safe emergency landing at Salt Lake City.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has been given the green light to send the Oregon National Guard into Portland after a federal appeals court on Monday overturned a lower court’s order to bar the deployment – but there’s at least one more legal hurdle to clear before there will be boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority,” the 2-1  ruling  from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Monday said.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, supported by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump, overturns a temporary restraining order issued by US District Judge Karin Immergut, who last week extended two orders blocking the mobilization of federal troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  It also marks a big win for the administration as it continues to battle other Democrat-led cities over troop deployment – efforts that local and state leaders say are a disproportionate response to protests against the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what else we know:\n \n\n   \n    When will troops be deployed?\n \n\n   \n  The ruling overturns only one of two lower court decisions to block the deployment of the National Guard in Portland, and because a second decision is still in force, troops can’t immediately be mobilized.\n \n\n   \n  The second restraining order blocks the administration from mobilizing National Guard troops from anywhere in the US in Oregon. The administration argued in a Monday evening filing the second order should also be overruled given both lower court orders relied on the same legal reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  As the legal battle over Oregon continues, hundreds of National Guard troops are in a holding pattern far from home, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek said in a  news conference  Monday. “These citizen soldiers have been pulled away from their families and their jobs for weeks to carry out some kind of mission in Oregon.”\n \n\n   \n  If the second temporary restraining order is revoked, it is unclear when troops would be deployed or how many would be federalized, Kotek said, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “We have approximately 200 Oregon National Guard members still at Camp Rilea in limbo, as well as California National Guard members at Camp Withycombe. No idea of the mission. No idea of the timeline,” Kotek said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A response Tuesday from the state of Oregon and others argued the court should not end or pause the second temporary restraining order.\n \n\n   \n  “Until there is an en banc vote, it would be legal error for this Court to construe the panel’s non-final decision as a ‘significant change in the law’ warranting dissolution of the Second TRO. Had Defendants appealed the Second TRO, the relief they now seek from this Court would already be before the Ninth Circuit,” the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, in their rush to file their Motion to Dissolve, Defendants have misconstrued the finality of the Ninth Circuit proceedings, failing to carry their burden for dissolution of the Second TRO,” it added.\n \n\n   \n    Will the state or city appeal?\n \n\n   \n  The sole dissenting vote on the three-judge appellate panel came from Judge Susan P. Graber, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.\n \n\n   \n  “Today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions,” Graber wrote in her dissent.\n \n\n   \n  Echoing Graber’s sentiments, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement, “Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification.”\n \n\n   \n  Rayfield asked the 9th Circuit to “act swiftly” and throw out the majority’s ruling through an “en banc” review, in which a larger panel of 11 appellate judges would reconsider the case.   \n \n\n   \n  Separately, a 9th Circuit judge Monday afternoon asked the court to vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. While such a request is not unusual, it’s more common for either plaintiffs or defendants to request such a rehearing.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the state and the Trump administration have until midnight on Wednesday to make their arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Portland against White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials have characterized Oregon’s biggest city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, which Kotek and other leaders in Oregon have  emphatically disputed . Kotek on Monday said in court that the situation in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were dangerous, unconstitutional, and also “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for other states\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s success in Oregon comes on the same day officials from Illinois and the city of Chicago asked the US Supreme Court to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state.\n \n\n   \n  The filing notes there is no rebellion or inability to execute federal law in Illinois, arguing the administration hasn’t met legal requirements to activate troops over the state’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “No protest activity in Illinois has rendered the President unable to execute federal law,” the filing says, describing protests at the ICE facility in Broadview, near Chicago, as “small,” manageable by local authorities and having “never hindered the continued operation of the ICE facility there.”\n \n\n   \n  The filing addresses constitutional concerns that the federal government is pressuring Illinois to either use its own National Guard to carry out the Trump administration’s priorities or let federal troops takeover, stating, “Such coercion is independently unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  The Monday filing comes after Trump on Friday  urged the Supreme Court  to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago in an emergency appeal against a lower court order that blocked the deployment of troops in the city. That temporary restraining order is set to expire on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, the administration argues, “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  Describing  those protesting  the administration in Chicago as “rioters” who are leading a “violent resistance,” the Trump administration  told the justices Tuesday  its decision to deploy the National Guard is unreviewable by courts or – at the very least – is entitled to great deference.\n \n\n   \n  “If the president’s determination is reviewable at all, such review must be extremely deferential,” the administration told the Supreme Court, pointing to recent decisions from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that endorsed “the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland to address similar violent resistance to federal immigration enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  In Tennessee, a group of seven elected officials sued the governor and the state’s attorney general last week for allowing the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor (Bill) Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee’s office responded Monday to the lawsuit filed against him, saying the governor has the authority to deploy the state’s Guard troops under Tennessee law,  CNN affiliate WATN  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, a landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  And for the second time in a week, Trump said on Sunday he would send the National Guard to San Francisco, telling Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo that the city “went wrong, went woke.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to Trump’s comments, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a  video address  that sending the National Guard would not help with the city’s ongoing efforts to combat drug dealing.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers – and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,” the mayor said.\n \n\n   \n  While welcoming stronger coordination with federal authorities, Laurie cited declines in violent crime rate reaching “levels not seen since the 1950s” and record low tent camps to show the city achieving safety “without compromising on our values or our laws.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom also said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-week-7-takeaways-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"04:51:00.000-04:00","title":"Second-year QBs ascending to stardom, Colts duo on historic pace, is Chiefs offense back to its best?

NFL Week 7 takeaways \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:51 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Outside of arguably the wildest ending to a regular season game in recent NFL history,  Week 7  had plenty of other talking points.\n \n\n   \n  Whether it be the Philadelphia Eagles finally getting their offense back on track or the never-ending struggles of the New York Jets, the unusually parity-filled season in the NFL continues to produce storylines.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the three main takeaways from Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Second-year QBs ascending to stardom\n \n\n   \n  Last season saw 2024 No. 2 overall pick  Jayden Daniels  explode as a rookie sensation with the Washington Commanders.\n \n\n   \n  This year though, the two passers picked either side of Daniels in last year’s draft – No. 1 pick Caleb Williams and No. 3 pick Drake Maye – are having their time in the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  After losing the first two games of the  season , Williams and the Chicago Bears have won their last four games under first-year head coach Ben Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  Although Sunday’s 26-14 win over the New Orleans Saints wasn’t a vintage Williams performance – he threw 15-of-26 for 172 passing yards with no touchdowns, one interception and two fumbles – his overall confidence level appears to have improved in Johnson’s offensive system.\n \n\n   \n  The 23-year-old came into the league as the consensus top pick in last year’s draft but struggled as a rookie, in a season which saw the Bears fire their head coach Matt Eberflus following a  disastrous Thanksgiving Day loss .\n \n\n   \n  After a game where everything wasn’t smooth sailing – Chicago had plenty of pre-snap penalties and Williams’ two fumbles came on botched snaps with the center – the young quarterback says these experiences are important if the team are going to continue improving.\n \n\n   \n  “Days like today are needed, just in the sense of it gives you a little bit more to be able to look back on something and figure out what’s important,” Williams told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “You have these moments, and then you get later in the season and you may start to have one of these moments, and you get to go back to the feeling, go back to what was wrong and what you needed to figure out early in the season. So it’s like: ‘Okay, I remember what it was, I remember how I can fix it.’”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Maye is also thriving in New England under a new head coach with the experienced Mike Vrabel now at the helm and long-time playcaller for Tom Brady, Josh McDaniels, installed as offensive coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  Maye and the Patriots are also riding their own four-game winning streak following a 31-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Maye was almost perfect in the win, throwing 21-of-23 for 222 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 62 yards on eight carries.\n \n\n   \n  As the Pats look for the quarterback to fill the sizable void left by the legendary Brady, Maye’s outing on Sunday hinted he might be just that man; his 91.3% completion rate broke Brady’s single-game franchise record of 88.5%, which he set against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s rare you have three potential star quarterbacks in the same draft but Williams and Maye are showing that together with Daniels, they could make the 2024 class one for the ages.\n \n\n   \n    Colts duo on historic pace\n \n\n   \n  No one could’ve predicted how well this Indianapolis Colts season is going.\n \n\n   \n  Quarterback Daniel Jones was coming off being cut by the New York Giants and spending time as a reserve QB for the Minnesota Vikings. Jones won the starting job after an offseason battle with 2024 fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson but expectations were not high.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Colts have been everything and more through seven weeks of the 2025 campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Their 38-24 win over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday saw them hold onto their spot atop the AFC and improve their record to 6-1.\n \n\n   \n  Indy’s proficient offense, led by Jones and running back Jonathan Taylor, has scored 232 points, averaging a league-best 33.1 per game. The 232-point tally is the most scored by a Colts team through seven games since 1964,  per the NFL .\n \n\n   \n   According to NFL researcher John Todd , Jones is the first player to complete two-thirds of his passes and have 200-or-more pass yards in each of his first seven games of a season since at least 1950.\n \n\n   \n  Jones has undoubtedly been helped by Taylor’s excellence; on Sunday, he rushed for 94 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries. It is his third game this year with at least three rushing scores.\n \n\n   \n  In doing so, he became the  fourth player since 1950  to have at least three games of scoring three-plus rushing touchdowns within the first seven games of the season, joining Derrick Henry, Priest Holmes and Jim Brown.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor  leads the NFL  in rushing yards (697) and rushing touchdowns (10) and is second in the league in rushing attempts (131). He led the league in all three categories in the 2021 season and, if he was to do so again this year, he’d be the first player since Brown to achieve the feat more than once.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s the best back in the league right now, there’s no doubt,” Colts head coach Shane Steichen said of Taylor. “He’s running hard, he’s running physical, he’s got great vision. Yeah, he’s just balling out man.”\n \n\n   \n  The Colts are the surprise playoff contenders, but if Jones and Taylor can keep performing at the highest level, who’s to say a deep postseason run couldn’t be on the cards?\n \n\n   \n    Is the Chiefs offense back to its best?\n \n\n   \n  When Patrick Mahomes exploded onto the scene with the Kansas City Chiefs, he had a revolutionary effect on how offenses operate in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  But as defenses have found ways to slow him down and some of the Kansas City QB’s key contributors have moved on or gotten older, the Chiefs offense has transitioned into more of a dink-and-dunk operation.\n \n\n   \n  That is until this year.\n \n\n   \n  After a slow opening two weeks, the explosive plays are back for Mahomes and the Chiefs, culminating in their 31-0 domination of the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas City has now scored over 30 points in its past four games – in contrast, they had scored 30 points or more six times over the past two seasons combined – and, following the return of receiver Rashee Rice from his  six-game suspension , boasts a plethora of offensive weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Rice was playing at an All-Pro level last year before suffering a torn ACL, second-year receiver Xavier Worthy is always improving and even tight end Travis Kelce is appearing more sprightly than last campaign.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Mahomes threw three touchdown passes – two to the returning Rice and one to Marquise Brown – while Isiah Pacheco ran for another. It was the 28th game of Mahomes’ career where he’s had at least three TD passes and no interceptions, surpassing Russell Wilson for the most such games by a quarterback in their first nine seasons in NFL history.\n \n\n   \n  It was also the 93 rd  regular season victory of his career, passing Peyton Manning for the most regular-season wins ever by a player under the age of 31.\n \n\n   \n  After Sunday’s dominant victory over the Raiders, head coach Andy Reid highlighted the impact of having Rice back on the field to help the offense.\n \n\n   \n  “He did a great job. I was a little cautious with him on how many plays and all that. I thought he came out and functioned at a high level for being gone for all this time,” Reid told reporters. “It’s crazy that he can come back and do what he did and do it at the level that he did it at.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll gradually build him up. We’ll get his reps up here a little bit as we go. You got to be careful with that when somebody’s been off for a while. I thought all of them together did some really good things. … There’s a lot of things happening there that are positive.”\n \n\n   \n  Even though the Chiefs’ 4-3 record is some way off the top of the AFC at the moment – the Colts lead the conference with a 6-1 record with the Patriots and Denver Broncos sitting at 5-2 – this revival in offensive production has put the rest of the league on notice.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of the oldest hostage   taken   by Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attacks was among two deceased hostages returned to Israel from Gaza on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Arye Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar’s remains had been identified and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had informed their families,   a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  Two coffins carrying the bodies of Zalmanovich and Adar crossed the border into Israel earlier on Tuesday and were taken to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine for formal identification and to investigate the causes of death.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has now returned 15 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the US-proposed ceasefire agreement, which was signed on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  Zalmanovich was abducted alive from his house at Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel during the October 7 attacks and is thought to have been killed in captivity on November 17, 2023, at the age of 85.\n \n\n   \n  He was the oldest hostage taken by Hamas, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement, describing him as “a tough and modest man who demanded nothing for himself.” The kibbutz said he was one of the founders of the community.\n \n\n   \n  Tamir Adar, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz, died fighting to defend it against Hamas on October 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza, the IDF said. He was 38 at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Those close to him describe him as sociable and beloved, a thoughtful and sensitive conversationalist with a keen sense of humor,” the families’ forum said.\n \n\n   \n  “The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Zalmanovich and Adar families, and of all the families of the fallen hostages,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n    A grandfather and a family man\n \n\n   \n  Zalmanovich was a father of two, a grandfather of five and “a man of the land,” said a spokesperson for the Nir Oz Kibbutz.\n \n\n   \n  A farmer by occupation, he grew wheat “in the harsh conditions of the Negev” and “agriculture was the center of his life,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  As a founding member of the community, Zalmanovich, known as Zalman, “saw the kibbutz as the fulfillment of his life and his home, and the community as his family,” the statement added.\n \n\n   \n  “We will always remember Zalman as an honest and humble worker, an idealist and a farmer at heart and soul,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  Adar, a father of two, was described as a “family man, a lover of people and nature, a farmer and an educator by profession,” by the kibbutz spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  An avid supporter of Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club, Adar was “always surrounded by friends and loved by everyone,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very fond of birds of prey and used to follow them with binoculars while working in the fields and on trips,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  “We will remember Tamir as a dedicated educator, connected to nature and agriculture, a beloved husband, father, son, brother and grandson who is missed by all of us,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  Under the Trump administration’s ceasefire agreement, Hamas was supposed to return all the living and deceased hostages within the first 72 hours of the ceasefire going into effect.  Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies in Gaza. One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military.\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments at the time suggested Hamas misidentified the body rather than intentionally sending the wrong one, an Israeli source said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Not going to happen overnight’\n \n\n   \n  The latest hostage release comes hours after US Vice President JD Vance touched down in Israel and the Trump administration moves to implement the next phase of its ceasefire plan.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas  affirmed their commitment  to the ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas and the Israeli military have each accused the other of violations.\n \n\n   \n  Vance on Tuesday  downplayed concerns  about the fragility of the ceasefire  but declined to put a timeline on the return of all deceased hostages and Hamas’ complete disarmament.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a focus of everybody here to get those bodies back home to their families, so that they can have a proper burial. Now, that said, this is difficult. This is not going to happen overnight,” Vance said at a press conference in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The US vice president also said some of the deceased hostages are “buried under thousands of pounds of rubble. Some of the hostages, nobody even knows where they are.

\n       \n  By Jack Guy, Caitlin Danaher, Pierre Meilhan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:27 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The jewelry taken from the  Louvre  Museum in Paris is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million), according to a French prosecutor, as the search continues for the stolen treasures.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told French radio station RTL the value of the loot taken in Sunday’s daylight robbery had been estimated by the museum’s curator.\n \n\n   \n  “This sum is indeed spectacular, but we must remember that this damage is economic. But it has nothing parallel or comparable to the historical damage caused by this theft,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 100 investigators are involved in the manhunt to track down the criminals who made off with artifacts from the French crown jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Experts fear that the prospects of recovering the jewelry are slim. But Beccuau warned that the thieves may struggle to obtain the loot’s value if they chose to dismantle the pieces to resell the jewels or melt down the metals.\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre remained closed on Tuesday, in accordance with its scheduled opening times, but is due to reopen on Wednesday. The Apollo Gallery targeted by the thieves will remain closed.\n \n\n   \n    How did the heist happen?\n \n\n   \n  The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, through a window.\n \n\n   \n  Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutors say it took the robbers four minutes to break into the gallery, snatch the jewelry, and leave.\n \n\n   \n  “At 9:34 a.m., half an hour after opening, two men wearing yellow vests broke a window,” the prosecutor’s office said in a Monday statement. The robbers “left at 9:38 a.m,” and left on two scooters “along the banks of the Seine.”\n \n\n   \n  The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n    What was stolen?\n \n\n   \n  Among the items taken from the Louvre was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The diadem – a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty – features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Also stolen was an emerald necklace and earrings set that was a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, containing 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for.\n \n\n   \n    Wider implications for France\n \n\n   \n  French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the Louvre heist exposed security failings at the museum.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”\n \n\n   \n  “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Elaine Sciolino, author of “Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum,” emphasized the significance of a robbery at the Louvre, which was originally built as a fortress before becoming a palace for the French royal family.\n \n\n   \n  “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    How is the investigation going?\n \n\n   \n  Investigators do not have any solid leads as to who was behind the heist but are slowly amassing a body of evidence, a law enforcement official in France who has been briefed on the ongoing investigation told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves were not able to burn the truck they used for the break in, so investigators are combing it for any traces of DNA, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of this process, investigators have had to build a tent around the truck so they can fume it to bring forth fingerprints, which has slowed down the process slightly, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, investigators recovered one of the two scooters the thieves used to get away, according to the official. They have also retrieved a helmet believed to have been worn by one of the thieves, the official added.\n \n\n   \n    Will the jewelry be recovered?\n \n\n   \n  Natalie Goulet, a Centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that she believes the jewelry has probably already been taken out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the pieces are already abroad,” she said. “I think it’s lost forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet also appeared on BBC Radio about the prospects of recovering the jewelry, replying: “None.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jewelry will be cut up and sold and used as a money-laundering system,” she said. “It’s the easiest way to clean dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said.\n \n\n   \n  “They have absolutely no morals,” she said. “They don’t appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet added that she was “very, very pessimistic” about the prospects of recovering the jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  Sciolino, the author, was similarly downbeat.\n \n\n   \n  “They can be dissembled, they can be cut, they can be sold on the black market,” she told BBC Radio. “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.”\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Past heists\n \n\n   \n  The most well-known robbery at the Louvre took place in August 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was stolen off the museum’s walls by handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.\n \n\n   \n  It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned.\n \n\n   \n  A bungling police investigation then dragged on for two years before the painting was recovered in December 1913, making it the most famous artwork in the world.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, a work by French painter Camille Corot was stolen from its frame in 1998 and has never been found.\n \n\n   \n  More recent heists at other European museums include the  theft of four ancient gold artifacts  from a museum in the Netherlands in January.\n \n\n   \n  Robbers used explosives to break into the Drents Museum in Assen, making off with three gold bracelets dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC gold Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National History Museum of Romania in Bucharest.\n \n\n   \n   Correction:   This story has been updated to reflect that there was a theft from the Louvre in 1998. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/americas/peru-lima-state-of-emergency-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"Peru declares 30-day state of emergency in Lima to tackle rising crime","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Peru's newly elected President Jose Jeri has declared a 30-day state of emergency in Lima and the neighboring province of Callao to combat rising crime, following violent protests that resulted in one death and over 100 injuries.

  \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:02 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans have spent many days trying to marginalize the massive anti-Trump “No Kings” rallies held across the country over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve argued the people involved were extremists and even  predicted they would be violent  (which turned out not to be true). They’ve claimed the protesters hate America. And they’ve argued that the “No Kings” message itself is nonsensical, given President Donald Trump is a democratically elected president who sometimes works with Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that the people were “not representative of this country.” He and his team have taken to mockingly posting memes and AI videos  with Trump donning a crown  — including one that the president shared in which he dumps brown waste on protesters.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson added Monday night on Fox News that the protesters’ messages were “completely the opposite of what America was founded upon.”\n \n\n   \n  New polling, though, reinforces how much the thrust of the “No Kings” message has resonated with much of the American public.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, a majority of Americans appear sympathetic to it, at least to some extent. And their ranks appear to be growing.\n \n\n   \n  The  survey from the Public Religion Research Institute  gave people two options. One was that Trump is a “potentially dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys democracy.” The other was that he’s a “strong leader who should be given the power he needs to restore America’s greatness.”\n \n\n   \n  Americans chose the “dictator” option by a strong margin, 56%-41%.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, that margin has nearly doubled since April, when Americans also sided with the “dictator” option but  by a smaller, 52%-44% margin .\n \n\n   \n  The same poll also showed a 54% majority sided with the view that Trump is waging an “assault on constitutional balances and the rule of law.” The alternative was that his overhaul of the federal government is “a long-overdue correction of disastrous policies” (43%).\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible to oversell poll numbers like this. Giving people binary choices can inflate numbers by making people choose one extreme or another. People who don’t like Trump but don’t think he’s a dictator might feel compelled to choose the “dictator” option to avoid endorsing a man they don’t like.\n \n\n   \n  But tellingly, the poll also asked people about the strength of their views. Fully 45% of Americans said they “strongly” agreed Trump was a dangerous dictator, and 43% strongly agreed that he’s waging an assault on checks and balances and the rule of law.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, nearly half of independents strongly agreed with those sentiments.\n \n\n   \n  These are, to put it mildly, not insignificant numbers. Say what you will about elements of the “No Kings” rallies; this polling suggests the thrust of the demonstrations hardly appears ridiculous to a majority of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And this is merely the latest indicator that huge numbers of Americans have such concerns.\n \n\n   \n    Clear majorities see him exceeding his powers\n \n\n   \n  Whether “dictator” or “king” are particularly apt labels, Americans are clearly sympathetic to the idea that Trump is abusing his power.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the rallies Saturday, a number of conservatives argued that invoking “Kings” was a non sequitur, given Trump was popularly elected in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t understand how Trump is a King when he won every single swing state, the electoral college and popular vote in a democratic election,”  said  Meghan McCain.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News analyst Brit Hume noted that at least some of Trump’s policies have gotten congressional approval. “ Some King ,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But there is no question that Trump has disregarded the limits of his authority — and disregarded Congress — in extraordinary ways. The protesters don’t seem to be arguing that Trump is technically a monarch, so much as that he’s seeking to exercise unchecked power when he can.\n \n\n   \n  And that seems to be an argument that a majority of Americans sympathize with.\n \n\n   \n    Many have worried about this for a long time\n \n\n   \n  If anything, these concerns already existed and have just gotten more pronounced as Trump has grabbed for more power.\n \n\n   \n  Before Trump’s second term began:\n \n\n   \n    It’s not just a partisan thing\n \n\n   \n  It might be tempting to look at these numbers and think, well, it’s just partisan.\n \n\n   \n  A decade ago, many Republicans  accused Barack Obama of acting like a king , too. And what about when Joe Biden tried to work around a Supreme Court ruling invalidating his move on student loans?\n \n\n   \n  But Americans clearly see a difference with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  For one, in that last poll mentioned above, only about 2 in 10 voters said Trump’s then-opponent, Kamala Harris, was a fascist — less than half of Trump’s number.\n \n\n   \n  For another, the Washington Post-Ipsos poll showed just 34% of Americans thought Biden had exceeded his authorities, compared with Trump’s 62%.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps tellingly, the AP-NORC poll in April showed a majority of Americans suddenly wanted to restrict that presidency in ways they hadn’t before. The percentage who said a president has “too much” power rose from 32% last year (under Biden) all the way up to 54% (under Trump).\n \n\n   \n  All of which suggests Americans — or at least a majority of them — see something extraordinary happening right now.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans can try to diminish the “No Kings” rallies all they want, but they’re speaking to something that’s very real to lots of people.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/trump-ballroom-east-wing-demolition-preservation-group","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-04:00","title":"Historic preservation group urges pause on East Wing demolition as Trump pushes ahead with his ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Society of Architectural Historians have urged the Trump administration to pause the demolition of the White House East Wing, which is being torn down to construct a 90,000-square-foot privately funded ballroom.

demolition as Trump pushes ahead with his ballroom \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the nation’s premier historic preservation groups on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to pause  demolition of the White House East Wing , which excavators began tearing into this week to make way for President Donald Trump’s planned  ballroom .\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, wrote in a  letter  to the National Park Service and two administration commissions that Trump’s proposed 90,000-square-foot addition would “overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House.”\n \n\n   \n  The alarm among preservationists at the demolition now underway reflected the shock many felt this week as images emerged of the East Wing facade being crushed into a pile of rubble.\n \n\n   \n  The work continued Tuesday as the excavators tore further into the building, the sounds of rhythmic pounding and occasional crashing drifting across the 18-acre White House campus.\n \n\n   \n  “You hear that sound? That’s music to my ears; I love that sound,” Trump told a group of Republican senators having lunch in the Rose Garden. Trump has said the $200 million project will be funded through private donations.\n \n\n   \n  The structure being demolished includes the suite of offices traditionally used by the first lady, as well as space for White House calligraphers, certain military aides, and the social secretary. Staffers in those departments have been relocated to other areas on the complex.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing’s wood-paneled foyer has long been the main point of entry for visitors attending social events at the White House, as well as those going on tours of the building. The section emerged in its current form in 1942.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump announced months ago his plans to replace the East Wing with the new ballroom — a necessary addition, he says, to accommodate large events — the demolition appears to have proceeded without an extensive public review process.\n \n\n   \n  In Tuesday’s letter, the National Trust for Historic Preservation “respectfully” urged the administration to “pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.”\n \n\n   \n  “These processes provide a crucial opportunity for transparency and broad engagement—values that have guided preservation of the White House under every administration going back to the public competition in 1792 that produced the building’s original design,” the letter read.\n \n\n   \n  The two commissions the letter was addressed to — the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts — have in the past reviewed proposed additions to the White House. That includes changes to the perimeter fence and the construction of a new tennis pavilion within the past decade.\n \n\n   \n  The current chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, Will Scharf, who serves as Trump’s staff secretary, said during a meeting of the commission last month that its jurisdiction covers construction, but not demolition — suggesting the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” Scharf said.\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation is not the only group to call for a more rigorous review of the ballroom project. Last week, before demolition began, the Society of Architectural Historians wrote in a  statement , “Such a significant change to a historic building of this import should follow a rigorous and deliberate design and review process.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s letter. But earlier Tuesday, officials distributed a lengthy list of past construction projects at the executive mansion, suggesting the ballroom fell into a pattern of improvements to the building.\n \n\n   \n  “In the latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House — a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and renovations from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  The images included construction of the West and East Wings, a multiyear gut renovation undertaken during Harry Truman’s administration, and the installation of a swimming pool overseen by Gerald Ford.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/trump-israel-gaza-vance-ukraine-russia-putin-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Reality catches up with Trump’s Ukraine peace drive and threatens his Mideast push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's peace initiatives in Ukraine and the Middle East are faltering amid persistent intransigence from both Russia and Hamas.

12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Wishing for peace is far easier than making peace.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s grand ambitions in the Middle East and Ukraine are struggling against their own internal limitations and the horrific hangovers of two brutal wars.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ditched plans for a quick second summit with  Russian President Vladimir Putin , declaring Tuesday that he didn’t want to waste his time, in the latest dizzying gyration of his drama-laden but so far futile peace push.\n \n\n   \n  And  Vice President JD Vance  rushed to the Middle East, where Trump  just last week  expressed hopes he’d forged “everlasting peace.” The ceasefire he brokered  between Israel and Hamas  is holding … just.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s critics might take some satisfaction that his big plans risk stalling out. He’s brought some skepticism on himself with his hyperbolic presentation of promising incremental events as epochal breakthroughs. But rooting against him just to deprive him of wins would be crass, given that global stability and thousands of lives may depend on Trump’s success.\n \n\n   \n    Trump needs to work both wars around the clock\n \n\n   \n  Complications bursting up around both of Trump’s major peace efforts underscore how constant US engagement is needed along with the president’s personal attention despite the constant whirl of controversy that surrounds him.\n \n\n   \n  After he halted fighting in Gaza, a significant achievement, there were hopes he could vault into a fresh attempt to end the murderous  war in Ukraine  after previous efforts foundered following his August summit with a stubborn Putin.\n \n\n   \n  But on Tuesday, the president called an abrupt halt to the latest chapter in his wild ride with Putin, making clear that a summit he’d predicted could take place in Budapest within weeks was no longer on the front burner.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to have a wasted meeting. I don’t want to have a waste of time,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after a call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart on Monday failed to yield breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s disappointment was the latest shift in a confusing week in which he seemed poised to send  cruise missiles  to Ukraine, was talked down by Putin and then had a new Oval Office clash with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\n \n\n   \n  So far, Trump’s Ukrainian efforts are only achieving one thing — disproving his own questionable assertions that Putin wants peace.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s hurried attempt to shore up progress in the Middle East, meanwhile, is meant to stop the administration’s other big peace initiative suffering a similar fate. After the fanfare of Trump’s victory lap in the region, the liabilities of his approach are becoming clear.\n \n\n   \n  The big question was always how to bridge an initial pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas and the ambitious peace plan that envisages Hamas giving up weapons and disengaging politically.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s visit followed — seeking to create an illusion of forward momentum to allow negotiators time to try to fill vacuums.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire teetered after Israel accused Hamas of killing two Israeli soldiers at the weekend and launched a wave of airstrikes that killed dozens of people in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Vance, seeking to stop the situation deteriorating further, sought to reassert the big picture in a symbolic warning to Israel and Hamas to stick to the terms of the agreement. His visit also demonstrated US commitment to key Arab states needed to implement Trump’s plan.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve seen the past week gives me great optimism the ceasefire is going to hold,” Vance said in an upbeat assessment that didn’t necessarily jibe with reality. “I feel very optimistic. Can I say with 100% certainty that it’s going to work? No.”\n \n\n   \n    How the latest Russia plan fizzled\n \n\n   \n  If Trump needed confirmation that Putin is not ready to make peace in Ukraine, he got one in a swarm of drones that attacked Ukrainian power plants in a return to a brutal strategy of  using winter as a weapon  against shivering civilians.\n \n\n   \n  The US president had hoped for signs of true policy shifts from Russia to justify a relaunching of his personal diplomacy with Putin. But the Kremlin strongman just played his classic card, calling Trump a day before he hosted Zelensky in the White House in a show of flexibility designed to mitigate new US pressure and the president’s anger and frustration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been speculating about sending Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine that would allow Kyiv’s forces to reach deep into Russia. But he snatched the idea off the table after speaking to Putin and rounded on Zelensky instead. But then, the call between Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday showed that any fresh summit would mirror Alaska’s impasse.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has not fundamentally changed a position that Ukraine could never accept. It wants Kyiv to cede territory in two eastern regions,  Luhansk and Donetsk , that it has been unable to fully capture in three years of fighting. Ukraine says such a step would leave it dangerously vulnerable to a future attack by Russia launched from the key lands.\n \n\n   \n  The melodrama repeated a well-worn cycle. Putin reacted when Trump looked like he might impose a price for Russian intransigence. Then the US president, after speaking to Putin, imposed pressure on Ukraine to give up territory. Then the process hit a wall again, leaving Trump frustrated.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is now back to his previous position that the enemies should stop fighting at current frontlines. “The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that,’” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky had earlier predicted that nothing will happen without Trump trying to coerce Putin to the table. “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities became a little further away for us — for Ukraine — Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,” he said in his daily address on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The impasse suits Putin, who shows no sign of wanting to stop fighting and could use more time to pursue his war of attrition with the goal of winning as much Ukrainian territory as possible before any peace talks.\n \n\n   \n  After a week of acrimony and shifting positions, nothing much has changed.\n \n\n   \n    The Middle East win was meant to inject a boost into the Russia effort\n \n\n   \n  Time is also a problem in the Israel-Hamas standoff. The current interregnum between the ceasefire deal and the implementation of later steps of Trump’s deal are allowing tensions to boil and threats to its durability to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has used the end of fighting with Israel to reassert its control over Palestinians in Gaza with revenge killings against alleged collaborators, raising doubts that it will ever lay down its arms as Trump demands. An international peace force is envisaged to keep permanent peace in the Gaza Strip, but until it can be formed, the ceasefire will remain fragile.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s trip was a sign to Netanyahu of just how important maintaining the ceasefire is to Trump and to states including Qatar and Turkey that they must keep up their pressure on Hamas to follow his 20-point plan. US negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff will seek to use the cover provided by Vance to try to create some progress to keep momentum alive.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s about 10 Tier-1 priorities, and we’re working all of them in parallel,” Kushner said in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  But more incidents in which Israeli soldiers die would almost certainly prod it to reopen hostilities with Hamas. This is why the complex transitional elements of the peace plan must be implemented quickly.\n \n\n   \n  “The critical issue right now is to begin to put in place the alternative administration. That starts with the Board of Peace, reinforced by having this technocratic Palestinian administration, and it is further strengthened by having the International Stabilization Force,” former US peace negotiator Dennis Ross told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on Monday. “All that has to be implemented sooner rather than later. That creates some momentum on its own.”\n \n\n   \n  So far, however, the stabilization force hasn’t got much past the theoretical stage, prompting Trump to try to push regional powers into hurrying along.\n \n\n   \n  “Numerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East, have explicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and ‘straighten our Hamas’ if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  No regional states are publicly lining up to send their young soldiers into Gaza to insert them between Israeli and Hamas forces. So the president’s post was closer to hope than reality — a description that regrettably also applies to his interrupted plan to end the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But at least he’s trying. And it’s not too late yet.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/asia/indonesia-uk-lindsay-sandiford-repatriated-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:46:00-04:00","title":"British grandmother spared firing squad in repatriation deal with Indonesia","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, who was arrested in 2012 with 3.8 kilograms of cocaine and sentenced to death by firing squad in Indonesia, will be spared execution through a bilateral repatriation agreement signed between the UK and Indonesia in October 2025.

 By Kit Maher, Kristen Holmes, Aileen Graef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:10 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paul Ingrassia is no longer the nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, two White House officials told CNN on Tuesday, after his chances of getting through the Senate confirmation imploded following reports of racist text messages that he allegedly sent to a group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia posted earlier Tuesday evening that he was withdrawing himself from his confirmation hearing “because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time.” He added that he appreciated the “overwhelming support” he received and that he “will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again!”\n \n\n   \n  His post came hours after Senate Majority Leader John Thune hinted that the White House would pull Ingrassia’s nomination following the reports of racist text messages. “I think they’ll have something official to say about that, but you know what we’ve said, and you’ll probably be hearing from them soon,” he told reporters at the White House.\n \n\n   \n   Earlier Tuesday, a White House official told CNN his nomination was “under review.”\n \n\n   \n  Thune said Monday night that he hoped the White House  would pull the nomination  after  Politico’s reporting  on the messages. “He’s not going to pass,” Thune added of Ingrassia, whom Trump nominated in May to lead the independent agency tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia was set to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, but one Republican senator on the panel had already announced he’d vote against advancing the nomination.\n \n\n   \n  “No, I do not support him,” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday night. Scott’s opposition would have effectively sunk the nomination in committee, assuming every Democrat joined him.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, after Politico’s report,  CNN’s KFile reported  that Ingrassia lost the support of the main Jewish group backing his nomination\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia, whose nomination had already drawn scrutiny, allegedly texted a group chat of other Republicans saying he has “a Nazi streak” and that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell,” according to Politico, which viewed the group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia’s lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, initially questioned the authenticity of the messages but added that if authentic, they were meant satirically.\n \n\n   \n  “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he wrote in a statement to Politico.\n \n\n   \n  “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” Paltzik added. In a subsequent statement to Politico, he said, “there are who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs,” and that “we do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”\n \n\n   \n   KFile  has previously reported on Ingrassia’s history of racist invective and conspiratorial rants, and affinity for a well-known White nationalist and Holocaust denier. His nomination had drawn scrutiny over his past promotion of conspiracy theories and tweets from his podcast that included calls for martial law following Trump’s 2020 election loss and harsh anti-Israel rhetoric aimed at the GOP. Ingrassia also argued publicly that “straight White men” are the most intelligent demographic group and should be prioritized in education.\n \n\n   \n  Amid KFile’s initial reporting in July, the Trump administration insisted that Ingrassia had the backing of “many Jewish groups,” listing four — but most of those groups told CNN in July that they do not support him.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Morton Klein — president of the main Jewish group that had been backing Ingrassia’s nomination, Zionist Organization of America — told CNN in a statement, “If these text revelations are accurate, I have no choice but to immediately withdraw my support. In this time of a surge and growing antisemitism, it is incumbent upon all of us to fight even any hint of antisemitism or racism.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia, who was admitted to the bar only last summer, held a brief White House internship during Trump’s first term. This year, Ingrassia first worked as a White House liaison at the Justice Department  before reportedly  being pushed out and reassigned to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  He would have marked a sharp departure from previous heads of the OSC, a role designed to be politically independent and to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. Rather than a long record of managerial or prosecutorial experience, typical of those who previously held the job, Ingrassia brought a fervent loyalty to Trump and a lengthy record of inflammatory statements.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, Em Steck, Morgan Rimmer, Ted Barrett and Annie Grayer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/adelita-grijalva-lawsuit-sworn-in-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00Z","title":"Arizona Sues Over Mike Johnson’s Refusal to Swear in Democrats’ Newest Congresswoman","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, alleging that Speaker Mike Johnson violated constitutional requirements by refusing to swear in newly elected Democratic congresswoman Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he “could be” seeking $230 million from his own Justice Department as compensation for past investigations into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be,” Trump responded when asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about a  New York Times report  that he was seeking the money in connection with complaints he had filed about past DOJ investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Though many of the details remain unclear, Trump acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself” damages to resolve claims that the Justice Department under his predecessor had wronged him.\n \n\n   \n  “With the country, it’s interesting, because I’m the one that makes the decision,” Trump said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A settlement to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has long claimed the Justice Department was weaponized against him, focusing his ire on the two federal indictments brought against him after his first term. Both cases  were dropped  after he won ree﻿lection last year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump argued Tuesday that he was damaged by the investigations into him and suggested he deserved to be paid for that, but added that he’d give away the money or use it to  renovate the White House .\n \n\n   \n  “As far as all of the litigation … they probably owe me a lot of money, but if I get money from our country, I’ll do something nice with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The New York Times reported Tuesday on that Trump was seeking $230 million in compensation and that any settlement might be approved by Justice Department officials who defended Trump, or those around him, during the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump submitted the complaints in 2023 and 2024, before he was reelected, The Times report says. The first claim seeks damages for alleged rights violations including the investigation into  Russian interference  in the 2016 election.\n \n\n   \n  The second complaint focuses on Trump’s  classified documents case  — which was dismissed after he was reelected — including accusing the FBI of violating his privacy when it searched his Florida estate in 2022. CNN  previously reported  on that claim, which sought $100 million.\n \n\n   \n  Asked to confirm the $230 million amount, a spokesperson for Trump’s outside legal team said only that “President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led Witch Hunts, including the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax and the un-Constitutional and un-American weaponization of our justice system by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers.”\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear what steps Trump or his legal team had taken more recently to press the Justice Department for a payment out of those complaints.

Its track is unclear, but it’s bringing a dangerous threat \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:42 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea, proving this year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  won’t be wrapping up quietly.\n \n\n   \n  The storm could slam the northern Caribbean with pouring rain and strong winds as it strengthens over extremely warm water this week. Melissa’s worst impacts could center on Hispaniola, where significant flooding and dangerous mudslides are possible for parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was churning about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Tuesday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n \n\n   \n  The storm is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday, according to the center, but it’s still tough to pin down exactly how strong it will become from there.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus. Puerto Rico is much more likely to experience some of the storm’s rain.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Days of rain and wind\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios forecasters have been monitoring for days. The one looking most likely at this point could spell disaster for parts of Hispaniola; the other could eventually take Melissa close to Central America.\n \n\n   \n  Both involve Melissa first loitering out over the Caribbean Sea for multiple days this week, churning up seas and bringing nasty weather to islands within the storm’s reach.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Melissa could take a turn to the north by late week and potentially move close to Hispaniola through the weekend, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning. This is the scenario the hurricane center’s track for the system reflects.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is the 13th named storm of the season but is the first to churn in the Caribbean Sea. The lack of storms allowed the Caribbean to become so extremely warm that its water is now basically rocket fuel for storms.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa taps into that energy, it could explode in strength – something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola. It’s still unclear exactly what parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could also deliver a considerable amount of rain to Jamaica and Puerto Rico in this scenario, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.\n \n\n   \n  Alternately, there’s still a chance that Melissa misses its window to take a northward turn and instead just creeps west over the Caribbean until it nears Central America — potentially Nicaragua or Honduras — next week. It could make landfall there or take a very late turn to the north and head for Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  The northern Caribbean would likely still receive a few days of wet and windy weather in this scenario, but rainfall totals would be lower, as would the flood risk, with Melissa moving steadily west.\n \n\n   \n    So… will it hit the US?\n \n\n   \n  It’s unlikely — though not entirely impossible — Melissa will deliver a direct hit to the mainland US. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be in the form of some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  Florida could be in play if Melissa remains a weaker storm for longer and takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.\n \n\n   \n  The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently,  Hurricane Nicole  slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and  Hurricane Zeta  smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.\n \n\n   \n  As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.\n \n\n   \n  Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/business/walmart-h1b-visa-pause","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:56:00-04:00","title":"Walmart halts job offers for applicants who need H-1B visas after Trump raises fees to $100,000","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., has paused job offers to foreign applicants requiring H-1B visas in response to President Donald Trump’s announcement of a $100,000 fee on the visa, which is intended to curb perceived abuse of the program.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Authorities arrested a man inside Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Monday after his family alerted police that he was armed and headed to the airport to “shoot it up.”\n \n\n   \n  The man, Billy Joe Cagle, was not armed when he was arrested but police found an “AR-15 assault rifle” in his vehicle parked outside, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n   He is facing charges of terroristic threats, criminal attempt to commit aggravated assaults, possession of firearm in the commission of a felony and possession of a firearm by convicted felon, according to Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum, who called it a “tragedy averted.”\n \n\n   \n  Cagle was also charged with several federal counts: attempted violence at an international airport, interstate communications containing threats to injure and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm,  according to  the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear whether Cagle, who lives in Cartersville, about an hour north of Atlanta, has an attorney. He was convicted of marijuana possession more than two decades ago,  according  to a Georgia Department of Corrections search.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI said  it is  assisting in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “This individual did have a semi-automatic weapon, and this individual was mentally challenged. And when you have those combinations together, it can turn out to be deadly,” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said at a news conference Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Cagle’s family had alerted Cartersville police he was armed and he had said in a livestream on social media he was on his way to the airport, Schierbaum said. Cartersville police then notified the Atlanta Police Department.\n \n\n   \n  But what authorities did not know, according to Schierbaum, is Cagle was already at the airport, having arrived shortly before 9:30 a.m. at its south terminal. “He seemed to be very interested in the TSA check-in area, which you can see was heavily, heavily crowded,” the chief said, referring to surveillance camera images.\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the busiest airport in the world,  with more than 108 million people flying through in 2024 . This year, it celebrated its centennial milestone. Atlanta is headquarters to major US operator Delta Air Lines.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re here today briefing you on a success and not a tragedy, because a family saw something and said something,” Schierbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  said  in a post on X she’s “thankful this individual was taken into custody by law enforcement before harming anyone.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores and Cindy Von Quednow contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/ddlj-bollywood-30-years-anniversary-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:49:00Z","title":"Why a Bollywood classic about forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the enduring legacy of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which remains a cultural phenomenon in India 30 years after its release.

Indian movie-goers 30 years on \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul and Ayushi Shah, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Inside the Maratha Mandir movie theater, audience members jump to their feet as the first notes of an iconic mandolin riff play, their bodies casting silhouettes against the opening credits of a film screened here   nearly every day for 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  A joyous, collective roar erupts from the rows as the lead actors share their first fated glance. Near the front, a young couple mirrors that gaze, their wedding photographer capturing a timeless moment against the iconic backdrop.\n \n\n   \n  Governments have fallen, and a new millennium has dawned, yet people still come to this Mumbai cinema to immerse themselves in the comfort of a love story known by heart, for less than $1 a ticket.\n \n\n   \n  Released in 1995, “Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” commonly referred to as “DDLJ,” tells the story of two young Indians, Raj Malhotra and Simran Singh, raised in London, who fall for each other during a freewheeling trip across Europe, only to face the ultimate test – earning her father’s approval. It became a cultural touchstone and the second-highest-grossing film of its decade.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the cinema’s daily showing has drawn young Indians dreaming of their own epic romance, those seeking a brief escape from the pressures of city life in Mumbai, and curious tourists who want to see the fandom up close.\n \n\n   \n  “I watch it almost every day,” said Suneel Shedge, a 50-year-old diamond worker from a nearby neighborhood who speaks with leading man charisma, and is prone to bursting into songs from the movie. As the film hits its three-decade anniversary this month, he has come to pay homage to what he considers Bollywood’s greatest love story.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes I cry, sometimes there’s pain. There’s happiness, there’s sadness,” he said. “A movie like this will never be made ever again.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s the “most beautiful love story,” said 23-year-old Vaishnavi Deshmukh, who has lost count of how many times she has seen the film.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t explain how I feel,” her boyfriend, Tejas Raout, 23, said. “It’s nostalgia.”\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, “DDLJ’s” narrative mirrors India’s own pivotal journey in the early 1990s — a nation shaking off its socialist slumber, opening its arms to the world, and finding a confident new voice that was both global in its outlook and Indian at its core.\n \n\n   \n  This cultural resonance also had a seismic effect on its cast. The film catapulted Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who played lovers in the film, from rising stars into cinema royalty, cementing them as the definitive on-screen couple for years to come.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, pinning down the exact formula which created this cultural phenomenon is impossible, said prominent Indian film critic and writer, Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  You can’t attribute its success to “just one single thing,” the author of “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: A Modern Classic,” which analyzes the film’s commercial triumph, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When the cinema gods deem that you create a classic, the stars align. Everybody’s stars align. And you get a film like this, which I think becomes a romantic blueprint for many generations.”\n \n\n   \n    Capturing the national zeitgeist\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, India was a nation beaming with endless possibility.\n \n\n   \n  Four years after the floodgates of economic liberalization had been thrown open, the country was in the midst of a cultural awakening. The state-run Doordarshan, which aired a mix of entertainment and news, was now competing with the vibrant pulse of MTV and Star TV, while the Indian-manufactured Ambassador car vied for space on the road with models made by Japan’s Maruti and South Korea’s Daewoo. On giant billboards towering over cities, Coca-Cola returned to wage war against Pepsi, and the American daytime soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” had become a household name.\n \n\n   \n  This influx of choice created a thrilling but anxious juxtaposition: Indians were captivated by globalization but also fearful of losing their own identity.\n \n\n   \n  Into this cultural moment, stepped filmmaker Aditya Chopra (no relation to film critic Anupama Chopra), the son of the late Yash Chopra — Bollywood’s legendary “King of Romance.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the ’90s, the mood was about aspiration. The mood was about looking westward,” he said in the 2023 Netflix docuseries, “The Romantics,” which chronicles his family’s contribution to Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Aditya Chopra had an idea for his directorial debut: a script he wrote that would capture the energy of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  In “DDLJ,” Simran, the devoted daughter of Baldev Singh, a hardworking owner of a corner shop, is initially not attracted to Raj, the low-achieving but fun-loving son of a wealthy immigrant. As they dance and sing their way through Switzerland, however, they eventually fall in love. But Simran’s stern, conservative father, has already arranged her marriage to another man.\n \n\n   \n  “Love was always rebellious, against the parents,” Aditya Chopra said of other films at the time. “That always bothered me.”\n \n\n   \n  So, instead of eloping in defiance of tradition, the charming Raj embarks on a mission to win Simran’s father’s approval in elaborate, often comedic ways. Simran, on the other hand, struggles between her duty as a daughter and her desire to marry the man she loves.\n \n\n   \n  In the film’s climax, Baldev looks at his daughter and grants her his blessing. “Go, Simran, go. Live your life,” he says. What follows is an iconic sequence, captured in slow-motion: Simran’s desperate sprint down a train platform after ditching the planned wedding, her traditional bridal attire and thick, black hair billowing in the wind, Raj’s hand outstretched from the carriage door, his face bloodied after a fight with Simran’s doomed fiancé, and the triumphant embrace as he pulls her up to safety.\n \n\n   \n  The first half of the film unfolds in the cosmopolitan landscapes of London and continental Europe, while the second half transports the audience to the agrarian fields of India’s Punjab state.\n \n\n   \n  The characters take elements of Western culture to India, including the clothes they wear and their attitude towards love in a society where, in the mid-nineties, many parents claimed the right to choose — and veto — potential spouses.\n \n\n   \n  The central conflict captivated the nation back then and continues to resonate with many young Indians today. For viewers like Deshmukh, who was at the Maratha Mandir screening, the takeaway is clear: “Parents matter the most,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The score, composed by the duo Jatin-Lalit, created an enduring legacy, producing an all-hit album whose songs became timeless anthems for romance and celebration. All these years later, people “watch it for the music,” said Lalit Pandit.\n \n\n   \n  “I could feel right away this wasn’t just another film,” Manish Malhotra, the designer behind the movie’s costumes, told CNN. “(Aditya Chopra) was a first-time director, yes, but the way he spoke about Raj and Simran was so vivid, emotional, and precise that you almost saw the film come alive in that very moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Malhotra, who went on to become one of India’s leading fashion designers, was particularly inspired by the duality at the heart of the film’s message, which he channeled directly into Simran’s wardrobe. He looked at her “not just as a heroine, but as a young woman caught between London and Punjab, her wardrobe needing to echo both her Western upbringing and her Indian soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Simran wore short skirts and halter dresses, reflecting what young Indian women were wearing in the West. Meanwhile, “every pastel salwar, every floral skirt, every dupatta drape was about telling her story with authenticity,” he said, referring to some of her traditional Indian outfits.\n \n\n   \n  On the film’s impact, Malhotra admits he couldn’t have predicted its eventual scale. “But I did know it was special,” he said. “Because when you connect to a story that deeply, when the characters feel that real, the work flows with sincerity. And that sincerity has a way of staying with people long after the film is over.”\n \n\n   \n    Impact on future romance films\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” was the first mainstream Bollywood film not just to represent Indians living overseas but place their unique cultural conflict at the very core of its narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the film’s release, Indians abroad were rarely heroes in Bollywood movies. They were confined to negative archetypes: the villain who had lost his Indian values, or the seductress whose drinking and smoking habits signaled moral corruption.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the reasons that ‘DDLJ’ is so amazing is that there’s a piece of everybody there in it,” said Snigdha Sur, founder & CEO of The Juggernaut, a media platform that writes stories about South Asia and the South Asian diaspora.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re very Indian, and if you’re very nationalist… this film is about returning home to India… and getting permission the right way. If you’re a diaspora kid, you’re saying ‘we haven’t forgotten our traditions,’” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “You see two people who really want to be together, fighting for something they believe in. For Indians, and specifically from my experience… that’s the story of my life,” said Indian Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh in the “The Romantics.” “I know, deep down, I really seek my parents’ approval. And that’s why the ending of ‘DDLJ’ meant so much to me.”\n \n\n   \n  The wider Indian diaspora’s connection to the movie was immediately tangible and reflected in the box office numbers at the time. Made on a budget of less than half a million dollars, “DDLJ” earned nearly $2 million overseas,  according to  movie analyst Taran Adarsh. Back home, it became a blockbuster hit and the highest grossing film of 1995.\n \n\n   \n  But beyond numbers, it created the blueprint for the modern Indian film that would dominate Bollywood for the next decade; “a watershed moment,” according to the author Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematic landscape prior to “DDLJ” was defined by two prevalent narratives. There was the “angry young man”— a working-class protagonist, typically a victim of a corrupt system, whose story was driven by a quest for vengeance or social justice. Then there were the family melodramas centered on romances thwarted by stark class divides. Crucially, both worlds were almost exclusively rooted in India.\n \n\n   \n  Aspects of “DDLJ’s” s storyline influenced a string of future blockbusters, from “Pardes” (1997), which explored the search for a traditional bride for a Westernized son; the grand family saga “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham” (2001), centered on a wealthy patriarch’s disapproval of his son’s marriage to a commoner and set between London and New Delhi; and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003), which tells the story of love and sacrifice within New York’s vibrant Indian community.\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” also launched the legendary on-screen pairing of Khan and Kajol, who have starred in seven major films together, setting the gold standard for Bollywood romance for decades to come.\n \n\n   \n  “When you keep repeating (their pairing) and it keeps attracting an audience, it cements their position,” Anupama Chopra said. “And off the top of my head, I can’t think of any pairing that had that sort of longevity.”\n \n\n   \n    A step back in time\n \n\n   \n  Back at the Maratha Mandir, walking into the screening of “DDLJ” feels like stepping into a time capsule.\n \n\n   \n  A living museum of a bygone era, the building is an unassuming structure, its age showing in dilapidated sections and torn posters clinging to its gates. Inside, faded red leather seats evoke a classic, old-world ambiance. Popcorn and chips are still sold in simple, vacuum-sealed plastic bags.\n \n\n   \n  “People from all around the world come here,” said its manager Manoj Pandey, who has been working at the institution for 15 years. “When the movie came out in 1995, no one thought we’d be here watching it 30 years later… But it was definitely right after the opening that it was going to become a blockbuster and have a long life.”\n \n\n   \n  They still sell about 100 tickets a day, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The theater’s owner briefly flirted with the idea of stopping the show in 2015. But the announcement was met with outcry from the public. “We received hundreds of letters in protest,” said Pandey.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Khan and Kajol reunited on stage for the Filmfare Awards, one of India’s most notable annual events that honors excellence in Hindi cinema, where they danced to one of movie’s most beloved songs, “Tujhe Dekha Toh,” which translates to “When I See You.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, for all the love and adoration, there are moments from the film that haven’t aged so well, according to some fans.\n \n\n   \n  Viewed through a contemporary lens, the film’s gender politics feel dated, said “The Juggernaut’s” Sur, particularly in a scene where Raj gaslights a panicked Simran into believing they slept together after a night of drinking. This is compounded by the reduction of Simran’s agency to the singular goal of marrying her beloved, leaving her own personal ambitions completely unexplored.\n \n\n   \n  “What does she do? What are her work ambitions?” Sur said. “I want to know more about what she’s studying, where she wants to work.”\n \n\n   \n  For Anupama Chopra, the whole idea of Simran “being parceled between lover and father” is equally frustrating. “But every film is a product of its time,” she said. “And I can tell you at the premiere, none of us thought there was any problem with it because we didn’t know any better. We were swept by the romance.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Maratha Mandir, crowds casually trickle in, well into the film’s three-hour runtime.\n \n\n   \n  It’s clear that most have seen the movie before, yet when a big moment arrives, phones go up to capture it for social media as cheers erupt with a joy that feels brand new.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in one of the back rows, the diamond worker Shedge takes it all in.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as I’m alive and until my last breath,” he said. “I’ll keep watching this film.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/republicans-trump-government-shutdown-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:02:00-04:00","title":"‘We absolutely need him’: Some in GOP say it’s time for Trump to get involved in shutdown talks even as leaders rebuff idea","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As a prolonged government shutdown drags on, several Republican lawmakers are urging President Donald Trump to take a more direct role in negotiations with Democrats, arguing that his influence and leadership are essential to ending the stalemate.

Tommy Tuberville said of Trump. “He can make a decision on what we do.”\n \n\n   \n  “We absolutely need him,” GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN. “He has the strength and skills to get it done. The speaker is doing a great job, but we need Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The restlessness within the Republican conference comes as both sides have continued to dig in, leaving no clear avenue toward reopening the government without a major shakeup in the dynamics on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  And it signals growing unease in parts of the GOP with the toll that the shutdown is taking on the country and over  which party will ultimately shoulder the blame  — even as Trump and Republican leadership project confidence that their strategy will win out.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, to move this needle and get this thing off the bubble, President Trump will have to get involved,” said Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia. “That’s probably what will have to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries since before the government shuttered weeks back, a White House official confirmed earlier this week. The two Democratic leaders said Tuesday they’d put in a new request for a meeting with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Yet so far, Trump has opted to steer clear of the day-to-day maneuvering despite his self-fashioned image as a dealmaker, tasking House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune with managing the shutdown instead.\n \n\n   \n  They have so far refused to entertain any negotiations with Democrats, vowing not to bend to demands for concessions on health care in exchange for funding the government. Johnson, who has kept in regular touch with the president, has similarly dismissed the idea of getting Trump more directly involved.\n \n\n   \n  “He (Trump) is not going to negotiate with the Democrats, who have taken the American people hostage. We’re not going to pay a ransom to reopen the government,” Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  A frustrated Thune insisted to CNN on Tuesday that there is no “plan B” for ending the shutdown, signaling Republican leaders will keep forging ahead and pressuring Democrats to simply accept the House’s short-term funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  The extended standoff represents a departure from prior shutdowns, where funding lapses have typically prompted a scramble on both sides of the aisle to reach an agreement. During  the last lengthy shutdown  — a 35-day stalemate during Trump’s first term prompted by his insistence on funding for a border wall — lawmakers repeatedly floated proposals aimed at breaking the logjam, while Trump went as far as to cancel a holiday trip to Mar-a-Lago to remain in Washington amid the crisis.\n \n\n   \n  But this time around, Republican and Democratic leaders have so far found little reason to talk — with each resorting instead to attempting to outlast the other. There are no weekend meetings or meaningful negotiations. And the House hasn’t even been in session for over a month, with Johnson vowing not to bring the chamber back until Democrats are ready to cave.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Tuesday hosted Senate Republicans at the White House for a lunch billed in part as an effort to encourage continued solidarity, predicting in a speech that Democrats would ultimately lose out politically.\n \n\n   \n  “They are the obstructionists,” he said. “The reason they’re doing it is because we’re doing so well.”\n \n\n   \n  In conversations with senators over a meal of cheeseburgers, Trump signaled that he was open to talking with Democrats, and he later reiterated the stance in remarks from the Oval Office, saying he he had just “one little caveat”: only when the government opens.\n \n\n   \n  That stated position is in line with talking points echoed by congressional Republican over the last three weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s open to a conversation if there’s something substantive they have to offer, but the idea that they can hold the government hostage in a shutdown is not going to work,” Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota said, as senators returned from the White House clutching MAGA hats and other White House memorabilia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also touted the opportunity the shutdown has provided him to seize greater authority over the government’s vast operations and workforce, bragging about deep cuts to the federal workforce and funding cuts aimed primarily at ramping up pressure on Democrats. White House officials have sought to fire more than 4,000 government employees, while halting billions of dollars meant for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic states and districts.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not going to get a lot of things back,” Trump said of the cuts, later adding that “maybe indirectly, they’re doing good” by giving the administration an excuse to hack away at unwanted parts of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has telegraphed deeper cuts in the coming days, with budget chief Russell Vought saying he hopes to lay off more than 10,000 federal workers in total. Trump in the meantime has redirected funding to pay military service members and law enforcement officers, in steps that have effectively allowed crime and immigration initiatives central to his agenda to move forward unimpeded.\n \n\n   \n  Yet while Trump has reveled in the newfound leeway, some on Capitol Hill have grown increasingly impatient with the standstill. And with Democrats showing no fresh signs of backing off their stance, they argued that Trump may be the only one who can apply the direct pressure needed to force a resolution.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley went as far as to encourage Democrats to start contacting Trump directly. “He would answer anybody. They could call him. He would answer. I mean, he’s like very accessible,” he said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have similarly called for Trump to re-engage with Capitol Hill, as part of their bid to secure an extension of enhanced Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that House and Senate Republicans don’t do anything without getting permission from their boss, Donald J. Trump. And the reason why there have been no negotiations – zero negotiations – since Republicans shut the government down is because Donald Trump clearly wants the government shut down,” Jeffries said, arguing that “Trump definitely needs to get involved” and “off the sidelines.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the rising pressure on both sides of the aisle, Republican leaders have indicated no willingness to budge.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know what there is to negotiate,” Thune said at the White House. “Open up the government first.”\n \n\n   \n  Within the West Wing, officials have so far projected a similar resolve. They’ve seized on recent polling showing some subtle shifts among voters toward blaming Democrats for the impasse. And as Democrats’ have begun to push for direct talks with Trump, aides have interpreted it as a sign that the party’s position is growing increasingly untenable — and further confirmation that there’s no reason now to give them an easy out.\n \n\n   \n  “This is just frantic wishcasting from the Democrats because they’re in disarray and their shutdown strategy has led them into a trap,” one White House official said. “Our position has not changed in terms of what we want, and our feelings on the government shutdown.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/anti-immigrant-protests-dublin-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00-04:00","title":"Anti-immigrant protesters burn police van in Dublin after young girl attacked","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 21, 2025, anti-immigrant protesters in Dublin burned a police van and attacked officers near a building housing asylum seekers, with over 500 people participating.

Trump’s  hopes for a quick meeting  with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled out, with an administration official telling CNN on Tuesday there were “no plans” for a summit between the two “in the immediate future.”\n \n\n   \n  The change in posture comes after Trump said the leaders would meet “within two weeks or so, pretty quick” following a Thursday phone call. Now, it appears, that timeline is unlikely.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Tuesday he didn’t want the meeting to be “a waste of time.” He may still meet with the Russian leader, he implied, but he indicated it was no longer a top priority. “We’ll be notifying you over the next two days as to what we’re doing,” the president told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said after the Thursday call that the US and Russia had “agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week,” and officials had expected Secretary of State Marco Rubio would meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to lay the groundwork for the Trump-Putin summit.\n \n\n   \n  But multiple officials told CNN that diplomatic engagement, too, was no longer happening — at least for the time being — and one source said Rubio and Lavrov had divergent expectations about a possible end to  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine . Rubio and Lavrov spoke by phone Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call. Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” the administration official said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Although the US described the call as “productive,” a source familiar with the matter told CNN that officials felt afterward that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, and there was a sense that Rubio was not likely to recommend moving forward on a Putin-Trump meeting next week. The source said Monday that Rubio and Lavrov could speak again this week.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Lavrov rejected the notion of freezing the conflict — an idea put forward by Trump after  a meeting with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week and backed by Kyiv and Europe as part of negotiations toward an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin had previously sought to tamp down expectations of a rapid Trump-Putin summit, saying after the US president first announced it that it “may happen within two weeks or a bit later.” It added at the time that talks between Rubio and Lavrov would mark the first step toward organizing the Russia-US summit in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the summit cannot be postponed, because no date was ever set.\n \n\n   \n  “You cannot postpone what has not been scheduled,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The White House stressed Trump was still committed to brokering peace in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has consistently worked towards finding a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to end this senseless war and to stop the killing,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN. “He has courageously engaged parties on all sides and will do everything in his power to achieve peace.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Zelensky asserted that Russia “became less interested in diplomacy” after the United States declined to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities became a little further away for us — for Ukraine — Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday in his daily address. “This is a signal that this very issue — the issue of long-range capabilities — may be the indispensable key to peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “The greater Ukraine’s long-range capabilities,” Zelensky added, “the greater Russia’s willingness to end the war.”\n \n\n   \n  Even before revealing there were no immediate plans for Trump and Putin to meet, the Trump administration had come to believe that a big stand-alone meeting between Rubio and Lavrov was not essential to set the table for a summit. That is largely because Lavrov is not empowered to meaningfully move the process along, a senior administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration views calls between the two aides as effective to get a sense of where the Russian side is on certain topics, but it does not believe a big meeting between the two would be useful, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat described Lavrov as someone who is “100% loyal to Putin but who’s never in the room when real important decisions are being taken.”\n \n\n   \n  “To negotiate with Lavrov is somewhat a diversion while the important discussions are only with Putin himself,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the conversations about setting up a meeting between the two diplomats remains fluid, a senior administration official said, adding that it is possible they meet on the sidelines of a meeting of world leaders organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, which is set to take place next week in Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  In Rubio and Lavrov’s Monday phone call, they discussed “next steps” to follow up on the call between their two presidents last week about a possible end to the conflict in Ukraine, according to a brief US State Department readout. Rubio “emphasized the importance of upcoming engagements as an opportunity for Moscow and Washington to collaborate on advancing a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war, in line with President Trump’s vision,” according to the readout.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, described the call as a “constructive discussion” that dealt with “possible concrete steps to implement the understandings” Trump and Putin reached during their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  It has been more than two months since Trump held his last  in-person summit  with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. The nearly three-hour meeting ended without a deal as both leaders touted progress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly called for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  European leaders and Ukraine put out a joint statement Tuesday saying that they support Trump’s position “that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations” and that pressure on Russia must increase.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is scheduled to meet NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/russian-drones-target-ukraine-energy-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:18:00Z","title":"Swarms of Russian drones plunge parts of Ukraine into darkness, as Zelensky turns to Europe again","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, especially in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, leading to widespread blackouts and civilian casualties.

drones plunge parts of Ukraine into darkness, as Zelensky turns to Europe again \n       \n  By Tim Lister, Kosta Gak, Victoria Butenko, Nina Subkhanberdina and Max Saltman\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:18 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As temperatures drop in Ukraine, Russia has stepped up drone attacks on power facilities supplying millions of homes across the country.\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that the Russian military is repeatedly hitting the same areas to aggravate the population’s suffering. The northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy – adjoining Russia and Belarus – have seen constant attacks over the past month.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of people in Chernihiv were without power or water on Tuesday after more than 50 drones and missiles targeted essential facilities overnight. Two attack drones hit a heat supply facility and another energy installation, according to Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n  Later Tuesday, some 20 Russian drones targeted the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, according to Chaus, killing two men and two women.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has targeted Chernihiv’s power infrastructure on 15 days over the last month, according to the regional energy company.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a  massive  Russian attack on energy facilities in several regions, including Kyiv, on October 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s tactics are to kill people and terrorize them with cold,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  And the Ukrainians see another new Russian tactic.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians are deliberately launching unmanned aerial vehicles that continuously circle over damaged facilities, making it impossible to carry out work safely and deliberately prolonging the humanitarian crisis,” Ukraine’s energy ministry said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has developed a mix of drones and missiles in its attacks on energy infrastructure that sometimes overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses. In Sumy, which borders Chernihiv, power is yet to be fully restored in the town of Shostka and surrounding area after strikes two weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  After the latest strikes, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called on allies “to urgently mobilize additional assistance for Ukraine’s resilience: from energy equipment to energy sources and air defense capabilities.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are 203 key facilities in Ukraine that we need to protect with air defense systems,” Zelensky said earlier this month, most of them to do with electricity, gas and water.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian government has a two-pronged response to the growing Russian onslaught: more and better air defenses and longer-range missiles to intensify  Ukraine’s own attacks  on critical Russian infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Later Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said that Ukraine had targeted Russia’s Bryansk Chemical Plant – which produces gunpowder and other explosive materials – with long-range Storm Shadow missiles. Without mentioning the plant, the regional governor of Bryansk claimed on social media that Russia had “detected and destroyed 57 enemy aircraft-type UAVs” during a Ukrainian attack on Tuesday. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But Ukraine is not getting  US Tomahawk  cruise missiles, as had been anticipated in Kyiv and it’s still chronically short of air defenses.\n \n\n   \n  “Just a few weeks ago, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin felt real pressure and the threat of Tomahawks and immediately showed a willingness to return to diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday. “As soon as the pressure eased a little, the Russians began to try to jump off the diplomatic bandwagon.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian officials are anxious that US President Donald Trump is again souring on Kyiv ahead of a possible summit with Putin in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian source described Zelensky’s meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday as tense – if constructive overall. Zelensky himself said that “after many rounds of discussion” they had agreed the starting point for any ceasefire is “where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides understand what is meant.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than a month ago, Trump  mused  that Ukraine could win back all the territory it had lost.\n \n\n   \n    Zelensky eyes Russian assets\n \n\n   \n  Not for the first time, Zelensky is now turning to Europe for back-up, and will meet European leaders on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” Zelensky and 10   of the continent’s   leaders said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are developing measures to use the full value of Russia’s immobilised sovereign assets so that Ukraine has the resources it needs,” they added in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  About $200 billion of Russian assets in Europe have been frozen, and the European Union is exploring ways to use some of them as a loan to Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last week he would call for the EU to provide a 140-billion euro ($163 billion) loan to Ukraine to finance its war effort.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has described the idea as an illegal seizure of Russian property.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has suggested some of the frozen assets be used to fund the purchase of Patriot air defense batteries and long-range missiles. He’s aiming to procure 25 Patriot systems – but acknowledged this would take years rather than months.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky and Ukraine’s European allies are also wary of a summit in Budapest hosted by Putin’s closest ally in Europe, Viktor Orban – though the Kremlin said Tuesday that the venue and date have not been confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a prime minister who blocks Ukraine everywhere can do anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution,” Zelensky said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a clear pattern in Putin’s tactics, according to analyst Tatiana Stanovaya, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, based in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “Whenever Trump becomes too angry or frustrated with Russia, Moscow reaches out,” Stanovaya  wrote on X  Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  After Putin’s conversation with Trump on the eve of Zelensky’s visit to Washington, “Trump’s tone seems to have shifted,” Stanovaya said. “He’s back to saying that Russia is winning, that Ukraine will have to give up territory, and that the US cannot afford to keep sending missiles. Russia’s position has not changed at all – it is the same as six months or even a year ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Sunday how Kyiv would respond if a meeting in Budapest went badly, the Ukrainian president replied: “Even when it seems you’re cornered, it’s not as hopeless as it looks.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5561909","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Sports Ticket Prices Are Getting More Expensive — and Pricing Out Many Fans","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over the past two decades, sports ticket prices have more than doubled, driven by rising athlete salaries and a shift in team business models that favor selling fewer, more expensive tickets over large volumes of cheap ones.

expensive — and pricing out many fans \n         By Rafael Nam \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         What's the item? Sports ticket prices How has the price changed over the past two decades? Prices have more than doubled since the Labor Department started tracking sports ticket prices in 1999. Why have prices gone up? Because as every sports star  from LeBron James  to  Carmelo Anthony  has said, \"It's a business.\" Costs, including athlete salaries, have surged. But there are three main reasons why teams are hiking ticket prices: First, they would rather sell fewer seats at higher prices, than more seats at a lower price. It's similar to how airlines often make more money from their Business Class section rather than from selling lots of seats in Economy.  In addition, dynamic pricing — or adjusting prices based on demand — has allowed teams to wring out more money per ticket.  And then, there's this: Teams are offering more premium experiences — meaning swanky club areas and plush seats — because those seats allow them to charge higher prices. All these dynamics are familiar to Bob Hinz. He's been a fan of the Baltimore Orioles for just about as long as he can remember. He has many fond memories of the team and of Camden Yards, a ballpark that was  kind of revolutionary  when it was unveiled in 1992, with its retro design and old-school charm. And Camden Yards largely retained that identity over the years. Unlike other, more modern ballparks, Camden doesn't have ginormous seats behind home plate — or servers to bring cold beers to fans at their seats. Want a hot dog? You walk up the stairs for one — just like everybody else. \"Baltimore is a blue collar town,\" Hinz says. \"Always has been and always will be.\" Tickets have been affordable enough for Hinz to remain a season ticket holder for about two decades, even through seasons when the team was pretty bad. But Hinz was shocked when he got his renewal notice for next year. The Orioles, which were bought recently by  an ownership group  led by financier  David Rubenstein , had introduced a major revamp to their season ticket offerings, leading to bigger — and more expensive — packages. Hinz was floored. He and his wife bought seats for 13 games — at a cost of about $1,400 this past season. To retain their seats, the Orioles were now requiring them to sign up for a 20-game package.  \"I looked at it as a per-game price,\" Hinz says. \"And the per game price was up 35% from the prior year.\" (Full disclosure here, this NPR reporter is an Orioles season ticket holder who got the same message.) \"It's a business\" Many fans  reacted with outrage  on  social media . In a statement to NPR, the team says the actions are intended \"to deliver more tailored benefits,\" as well as  \"greater flexibility, in a simpler benefit program providing the best possible experience.\" \"These changes were made to ensure our Members were getting the best value for their investment,\" the Orioles added. And the team says its new season ticket options of 20-game, 40-game and full-season memberships are intended to align with 27 other Major League Baseball teams. Hinz, an accountant, gets it. Like other Orioles fans who spoke to NPR, Hinz says, \"It's a business.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Nonetheless, he was surprised. \"It really didn't matter ... what kind of fan I was or how long a fan I was,\" he says. \"It's just, this is the price and that's it.\" Understanding sports economics For Victor Matheson, a professor at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who's an expert on sports economics, actions like the ones the Orioles are taking make complete sense from a business perspective.  Across pro sports, Matheson says, teams are making the determination that \"they can make more money selling fewer, more expensive tickets rather than lots of cheap seats.\"  One way Matheson says teams are doing that is by replacing aging stadiums with nicer ones that have fewer seats, with the aim of raising more money per ticket sold. Teams are also widely adopting dynamic pricing, or adjusting prices based on demand. They can do that because teams are now able to leverage technology to gather as much information as they can on their fans — and their ability to pay. And then there's one of the biggest reasons of all: Teams are increasingly focusing on selling premium seats and what they label as premium experiences. That could mean special club areas or, during certain times in NFL games, the opportunity to stand on the sidelines. \"You concentrate your efforts on, you know, finding those super premium experiences for a small number rather than maximizing the total number of bodies you get through the gates,\" Matheson says. The cost of enhancing the fan experience In Baltimore, the Orioles are adapting to what they believe will be a better — and nicer — future. For example, as part of a $600 million funding from Maryland taxpayers, the team is undertaking major renovations of Camden Yards, including a bigger scoreboard. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But it is also using some of the money to build a \"premium club.\" A  video rendering  on the team's website shows a luxurious setting, with its own entrance and tables and bartenders pouring wine. The team told NPR the club is intended to provide \"a more elevated club experience\" where members \"can entertain clients and friends.\"  The team also says it wants \"to welcome fans who are looking for different experiences,\" including the recent introduction of a \"Bird Bath Splash Zone\" section — where fans get soaked with a hose during periods of the game.   On one level, Hinz understands. But he never realized how much that Orioles future would cost him as a loyal fan. \"It just felt a little like I'm just another number, and that's all that really matters to them,\" Hinz says. So he and wife thought long and hard. The fan in him wanted to renew again. He still remembers how, as a kid, \"there was a certain prestige associated with being a season ticket holder.\" But the accountant in him knew. \"My wife and I, we need to do what makes sense for us,\" he says.  And then Hinz sighed. After more that 20 years, he's giving up his beloved tickets.  He'll always love the Orioles. But as they say in sports, at the end of the day, it's a business. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1171741599","dateOfPublication":"2025-02-18","timeOfPublication":"06:18:00.000-05:00","title":"Watch NPR's News Roundup","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article promotes NPR's daily visual newscast, which airs from 7 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. ET every weekday, highlighting its availability on smart speakers such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant.

The discovery, confirmed by the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, is attributed to climate warming and increased international transportation.

The institute noted that the mosquitoes were one of a number of new insect species discovered in Iceland in recent years due to a warming climate and the growth of international transportation. Insect enthusiast Björn Hjaltason said he found the mosquitoes on a farm in Kjós, just north of Reykjavík, earlier this month. \"At dusk on the evening of October 16th, I caught sight of a strange fly on a red wine ribbon,\" Hjaltason  told Icelandic broadcaster RUV . \"I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly.

Here's what to know \n         By Kat Lonsdorf \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump's federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to both Oregon and Illinois are facing a pair of legal litmus tests — including one at the Supreme Court — that could be decided in the coming days. At the heart of both challenges is whether or not to defer to the president's assessment that major cities in both places — Portland and Chicago — are lawless and in need of immediate military intervention to protect federal property and immigration officers, despite local leaders and law enforcement saying otherwise. Both deployments were done against the wishes of Democratic state governors, and were quickly temporarily blocked by district courts. On Monday, a divided panel on the  9th Circuit court of appeals  overturned a temporary restraining order put in place by a federal judge in Portland, siding with the Trump administration, however another temporary restraining order remains in place. That ruling came days after the  7th Circuit court of appeals upheld  a similar block from a federal judge in Illinois on the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The Trump administration has  asked the Supreme Court  to intervene. Movement in both cases is expected in the coming days, in what has been a dizzying pingpong of legal disputes around Trump's use of the military domestically in  several Democratic-led cities  around the country . And while any decision will only impact troop deployment in an individual state, they could impact how courts weigh in on such cases going forward — and embolden the administration, legal experts say. \"This could be a pretty seminal week in terms of the bigger legal fight over domestic deployments,\" says Scott R. Anderson, a fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution and senior editor of Lawfare. The 9th Circuit and Portland, Ore.  The 9th Circuit's decision earlier this week only applies to one of the two temporary restraining orders that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued this month to block the National Guard deployments — meaning that troops can still not be on the streets in Portland. But the  federal government has asked  Immergut to remove her second temporary order. A court hearing has been  scheduled for Friday  to discuss the dissolution of that order. The 9th Circuit is also deciding whether or not to revisit the ruling made earlier this week with a larger group of judges — and that decision could come before Immergut's deadline. Trump has said that the 9th Circuit decision has made him feel empowered to send the National Guard to any city where he deems it necessary. \"That was the decision. I can send the National Guard if I see problems,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday. In recent days, Trump has renewed an interest in  sending troops to San Francisco . Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University Loyola Law School and an expert in constitutional law, worries the ruling by the 9th Circuit \"authorized blindness to facts.\" \"It said [Trump] can decide that there's a war when there's nothing but bluebirds,\" he says, noting that's likely why an immediate call for a full review was made. \"I fully expect a larger group of 9th Circuit judges to say we don't have to be blind to what's actually going on in order to give ample deference to the Trump administration.\" The Supreme Court and Chicago At the same time, the Trump administration has issued an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on whether National Guard troops can be deployed in Illinois, after the 7th Circuit court of appeals upheld a district court's block. It's unknown when, or if, the Supreme Court will issue a decision, although experts expect it in the coming days as well. The decision, although not precedent-setting, will likely clarify the president's power to deploy federal military resources — and how deferential the courts should be to his administration's presentation of facts — but only to a point. Emergency decisions are usually short, without much reasoning provided by the justices, experts say. \"It ends up kind of putting the onus on district and appellate courts to read the tea leaves of those interim orders to inform these much larger questions in very different factual environments, you know, possibly months in the future,\" says Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. He says that while the emergency decisions from the Supreme Court don't apply broadly, in recent months, some judges have started to treat them as if they do. \"I think what we're going to get in at least the medium term is even more confusion than we've had so far,\" he says. But just how the Supreme Court might weigh in isn't clear. \"I think it's a harder case for the Supreme Court than some people might think, who go in with the assumption the Supreme Court is just naturally inclined toward the administration's positions on things — and it is in many contexts,\" says Anderson of the Brookings Institution. He says that while it's standard for courts to be deferential to the president, it's also standard to believe the facts presented by the local courts. \"That is a tricky, tricky sort of situation here,\" Anderson says. What could this mean for possible deployments going forward? These two expected decisions will only directly affect Portland or Chicago. But the implications of both – especially something from the Supreme Court – could have ripple effects in future litigation. Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, says that what's particularly worrying is that the Department of Justice has been  expressly celebrating high arrest counts by law enforcement in places like Chicago , while still saying the military is necessary to help. \"If the bar is so low that the President can use the military at a time when his administration is touting how effective civilian law enforcement is, it becomes hard to imagine a scenario where he couldn't deploy the military,\" she says. Experts say that these legal challenges are just the beginning of what will surely be a long and winding road through the U.S. court system. \"This is really just the first battle. There are a lot of legal questions that come after this,\" Anderson says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581469","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Magical Dinosaur Discovery in Mongolia: Scientists Unearth Oldest Pachycephalosaur Fossil","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A team of paleontologists led by Chinzorig Tsogtbaatar discovered a previously unknown, juvenile pachycephalosaur species, Zavacephale rinpoche, in southeast Mongolia in June 2019.

Paleontologist  Chinzorig Tsogtbaatar  and several colleagues set out by foot from their campsite to a rocky outcrop dating back some 110 million years to the early Cretaceous. \"Then, after 15 to 20 minutes, I saw something [on the] other side of the hill,\" says Tsogtbaatar. It was a bright object of some sort. \"It [didn't] look like a rock,\" he recalls. \"It [was] very unusual.\" Once he got closer, Tsogtbaatar — who now works at North Carolina State University — knew exactly what it was. A dome-shaped skull. It turned out that Tsogtbaatar had just discovered a new species of pachycephalosaur, a unique group of dinosaurs defined by their thick, bony, hemispherical skulls but about which little else is known. In that moment, \"we just stopped breathing,\" he says. \"This is the first definitive pachycephalosaur that's ever been found in the early Cretaceous,\" says  Lindsay Zanno , also a paleontologist at North Carolina State University in addition to serving as the head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. \"It just pops out of the fossil record with a fully developed dome, and bells and whistles on its head.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tsogtbaatar, Zanno, and their colleagues have introduced the world to this new species in a paper published in the journal  Nature . They gave it the scientific name  Zavacephale rinpoche . The word  rinpoche  is Tibetan for \"precious one\" and refers to the domed skull, which appeared out of the rockface to Tsogtbaatar that June morning like a perfectly polished jewel. Bones of enchantment The new specimen is 15 million years older than what had previously been the oldest pachycephalosaur ever found. \"So this dinosaur fills in a critical gap in the early evolution of this famous group of dome-headed dinosaurs,\" says  David Evans , a dinosaur paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto who wasn't involved in the research. After its excavation in 2019, the fossil stayed in Mongolia during the pandemic. Finally, in 2022, it was shipped to North Carolina for additional analysis. Zanno says the moment she first laid eyes on it, she was \"enchanted.\" \"Everyone just stood around the lab just holding this precious, incredible skull,\" she says. \"It's just the most beautiful specimen. It's magical.\" That domed head — made of solid bone and edged in spikes — is any pachycephalosaur's most distinguishing feature. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Their domes are essentially indestructible,\" says Zanno. \"It would have been able to protect the skull against pressure or impact. And so we think that these animals were battling it out with their heads.\" Still, researchers have known relatively little about these plant-eaters because most of the rest of their bodies haven't been found. So when the team in Mongolia went on to excavate dozens more bones from  Zavacephale rinpoche , it became the most complete pachycephalosaur skeleton ever to be unearthed. \"It's about the size of a German shepherd,\" says Zanno, \"but you have to remember 75% of the body is a neck and a tail, so they're very light. It would have only weighed about 12 pounds.\" A juvenile jewel This little fossil has already revealed a few new insights. The stomach contained small stones that would have helped the animal digest its food. The tail is shot through with bony tendons, which would have made it more rigid. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Plus, this was the first time a pachycephalosaur's hand bones had ever been found. \"At first, we thought it was something it ingested instead of parts of its own body. That's how tiny its hands were,\" says Zanno. In addition, the limb bones allowed the researchers to determine the age of the dinosaur. It was at least two years old, making it a juvenile. This shows that young pachycephalosaurs like this one already had fully developed domes. \"Whether they were battling it out for territory or mates is something we're not entirely sure of,\" says Zanno, \"but what's clear is that whatever they were doing with those domes, they started practicing at a very young age.\" The specimen is now back home at the Institute of Paleontology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences as part of the country's mission to protect its natural and cultural heritage. Cary Woodruff , a curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Frost Museum of Science in Miami who wasn't involved in the study, said he was floored by the discovery — and that his surprise was mixed with a dash of \"very friendly jealousy.\" \"How he even found the specimen is just bonkers,\" Woodruff said of Tsogtbaatar. \"He doesn't just find a new one. He doesn't just find the geologically oldest one. He finds [what] everyone who works on pachycephalosaurs has always wanted to find.\" Evans was similarly impressed. \"I was just stunned by the beauty and completeness of this particular fossil,\" he says. \"This is a specimen that we'll be learning from for many, many years to come.\" Woodruff is also confident that this fossil will spawn new ideas about how pachycephalosaurs once lived. He says usually paleontologists have to work with very incomplete skeletons. \"In our mind, we can see, we can imagine what the rest of it looked like,\" Woodruff says. \"But you didn't have to imagine anything with a specimen like this.

Science reporter Ari Daniel describes a stunning discovery from southern Mongolia. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: It was a cloudy morning in June 2019, when paleontologist Chinzorig Tsogtbaatar and several colleagues set out by foot from their campsite to a rocky outcrop dating back about 110 million years to the early Cretaceous. CHINZORIG TSOGTBAATAR: Then after 15 to 20 minutes, I saw something in other side of the hill. DANIEL: A bright object of some sort. TSOGTBAATAR: It wasn't looked like a frog - very unusual. Then I want to go down to check. DANIEL: Once he got closer, Tsogtbaatar, who now works at North Carolina State University, knew exactly what it was. TSOGTBAATAR: It was a skull. DANIEL: And not just any skull. It was dome shaped. Tsogtbaatar had just discovered a new species of pachycephalosaur. TSOGTBAATAR: We just stopped breathing. LINDSAY ZANNO: So this is the first definitive pachycephalosaur that's ever been found in the early Cretaceous. DANIEL: Meaning it's 15 million years older than what had been the oldest pachycephalosaur, says Lindsay Zanno, also a paleontologist at NC State. This specimen fills in a crucial gap in the early evolution of this group of dinos. Zanno remembers the moment she first laid eyes on it. ZANNO: I mean, everyone just stood around the lab just holding this precious, incredible skull. Everyone is enchanted. It's just the most beautiful specimen. DANIEL: That domed head made of solid bone and edged in spikes is any pachycephalosaur's most distinguishing feature. ZANNO: Their domes are essentially indestructible. It would have been able to protect the skull against pressure or impact. And so we think that these animals were battling it out with their heads. DANIEL: Still, researchers have known relatively little about these plant eaters. That's because most of the rest of their bodies haven't been found. So when the team in Mongolia went on to excavate dozens more bones from that new animal, it became the most complete pachycephalosaur skeleton ever to be unearthed. ZANNO: It's about the size of a German shepherd. But you have to remember, 75% of the body is a neck and a tail, so they're very light, at about 12 pounds. DANIEL: This little fossil has already revealed a couple insights. For instance, this was the first time the hand bones of a pachycephalosaur were found, and they were super small. ZANNO: We thought it was something it ingested instead of parts of its own body. That's how tiny its hands were. DANIEL: In addition, the limb bones allowed the researchers to age the dinosaur. It was at least 2 years old, a juvenile, meaning that young pachycephalosaurs like this one already had a fully developed dome. ZANNO: Whether they were battling it out for territory or mates is something we're not entirely sure of, but whatever they were doing with those domes, they started practicing at a very young age. DANIEL: The research is published in the journal Nature. Cary Woodruff is the curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Frost Museum of Science in Miami and wasn't involved in the discovery. He says usually, paleontologists have to work with very incomplete skeletons. CARY WOODRUFF: In our mind, we can see, we can imagine, like, what the rest of it looked like. But you didn't have to imagine anything with a specimen like this. It was there, right? The teeth are literally smiling at you. DANIEL: Woodruff is confident this fossil will spawn new ideas about how pachycephalosaurs once lived. Meanwhile, the specimen's back home in Mongolia, and the new species has a new scientific name that Chinzorig Tsogtbaatar bestowed. TSOGTBAATAR: Zavacephale rinpoche. DANIEL: That second word, rinpoche, is Tibetan for precious one and refers to the domed skull, which appeared out of the rock face to Tsogtbaatar like a perfectly polished jewel.

Postmarks include the dates that USPS stamps on envelopes, and those are often used to determine whether a piece of first-class mail was sent on time. But the Postal Service has  proposed revising  its  mailing standards  to say that postmark date \"does not inherently or necessarily align\" with the date that a mail piece was first accepted by a letter carrier or dropped off at a post office or collection box. \"In other words, the date on a machine-applied postmark  may  reflect the date on which the mailpiece was first accepted by the Postal Service, but that is not definitively the case,\" USPS said in a recent  Federal Register notice . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       USPS hasn't changed how it applies postmarks. What has changed is that, as the mail agency continues its  controversial reorganization plan , more parts of the country may not get their first-class mail processed until the day  after  it's collected by USPS. That's largely because the agency has  reduced how often it picks up mail in certain areas  more than 50 miles away from one of its new regional processing and distribution centers. The change, USPS says, \"saves money, reduces carbon emissions, and benefits processing operations\" at a time when fewer people and businesses are sending first-class mail compared to decades ago. Still, in California, which is holding a  special election for a closely watched ballot proposition  on congressional redistricting, the USPS notice about postmarks has prompted state officials to  urge eligible mail-in voters  to drop off their ballots before Nov. 4. \"If you want your vote to count, which I assume you do because you're putting it in the mail, don't put it in the mail on Election Day\" if you're more than 50 miles from a USPS regional processing facility, California Attorney General Rob Bonta advised  during a press conference  this month, noting that a voter could consider turning in their ballot at an official vote center or drop box instead. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       To avoid the risk of your mail not getting a postmark on the same day it's dropped off, USPS recommends stopping by a post office. \"If a customer — in any community, no matter where it is located — wants to ensure that their ballot or other mailpiece receives a postmark containing a date that aligns with the date it is mailed, the customer should visit a Postal Service retail location and request a manual postmark at the counter in person. It will be provided free of charge,\" USPS spokesperson Cathy Koeppen Purcell says in a statement. It's advice the agency has tried to emphasize  during past voting seasons , when it reminds absentee voters that USPS does not automatically postmark every piece of mail. However, for those who don't have easy access to a USPS facility, including residents of rural communities and people with disabilities, getting to a post office for a postmark can be a challenge. And for some mail-in voters, it can be another barrier to the ballot box as more states  change election rules  to move up deadlines and no longer count absentee ballots  postmarked by, but arriving after, Election Day . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"Tiny Desk Concerts Carousel: Featured Performances","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The home page of NPR features a carousel showcasing a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting intimate, live musical performances by artists.

October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Doctors have long known that antidepressants come with side effects for cardiovascular and metabolic health. But a major analysis from a team of researchers in the U.K. has, for the first time, pulled together data from more than 150 clinical trials to compare the physical side effects of dozens of antidepressants. The study,  published in  the Lancet   this week, details how each medication can affect weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol and other areas of health. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The end result is something akin to a \"sports league table\" for 30 different antidepressants based on their side effect profile, says lead author  Dr. Toby Pillinger , a psychiatrist at King's College London. \"It's never been done at this scale before and no one's ever put specific numbers to the amount of weight you'll put on, or to the amount that your cholesterol goes up,\" he says. The findings are based on existing data, mostly from 8-week drug studies, that altogether represent more than 58,000 patients. The most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the U.S. —  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors , or  SSRIs, like Zoloft and Prozac  — tended to have fewer physical side effects, according to the analysis. Other medications, particularly some of the older drugs, were shown to have more significant impacts. For example, a person who took nortriptyline,  a tricyclic antidepressant , could, on average, have an increase in heart rate that was 20 beats higher than the SSRI fluvoxamine. For other medications, the expected weight change could be four pounds gained, or lost. Pillinger says the intention is not to single out certain antidepressants as better than others. \"It may be that one medication which is pretty bad for one person actually is pretty good for another one. I think that is the message, rather than naming and shaming certain drugs,\" he says. Pillinger hopes the data can help prescribers and their patients make individualized decisions about the best medication. In fact, he and his colleagues have created  a free digital tool  that's already being used by clinicians all over the world to create a \"menu\" of options, based on a patient's underlying health and what side effects they'd most like to avoid. Dr. Nina Kraguljac , a professor at the Ohio State University, who was not involved in the research, says the study was well-done — and largely reassuring. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What surprised me about this study is that side effects are not that severe,\" says Kraguljac, who is also chair of the American Psychiatric Association's council on research. However, she stresses that \"side effects alone should not guide a clinical decision,\" since the study's results ultimately reflect an average, not the individual patient. \"Side effects do not happen in every patient and are not necessarily a reason to deter people from taking the medications,\" she says. The study does have some notable limitations. Even though many people take these drugs for months or years, the data was largely from 8-week randomized controlled trials, which are the most common. And some prominent side effects — that cause some people to stop taking antidepressants — were not evaluated, says  Dr. David Hellerstein , a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. He points out the impact on sexual function, gastrointestinal issues, and \"emotional blunting\" — a sense that feelings are being muted — are all common complaints that weren't looked at. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most of the side effects detailed in the study are already well-known, although he believes the work will still be \"a useful touchstone\" for patients and prescribers. \"Big picture, most of these drugs seem quite safe on a lot of physical parameters, especially the newer drugs, like the SSRIs and SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors),\" he says. But for some groups of people, the side effects might be significant, he cautions, \"and could affect what medicine the doctor would choose or what medicine a patient would prefer.\" And he notes, side effects aren't always a downside. Hellerstein has a patient who had lost a significant amount of weight due to depression, meaning an antidepressant that also led to some extra weight would actually be \"healthy.\" \"I would say that is not a side effect. That is a benefit of treatment,\" he says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5583517","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:27:00-04:00","title":"Misty Copeland hangs up her pointe shoes after performing at retirement show","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Misty Copeland, the first Black female principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre, retired from stage performances after a 25-year career, culminating in a star-studded gala at Lincoln Center.

Copeland, who a decade ago became the  first Black female principal dancer  in the company's 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise. Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like  Swan Lake . \"Misty didn't just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\" In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author — the second volume of her  Bunheads  series appeared in September — and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \" Be Bold ,\" an afterschool program designed for young children of color. But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage — including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades. The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in  Wrecka Stow , by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's  Sinatra Suite  with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo. The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters. On to the next stage Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it's clear an era is ending. \"It's been 25 years at ABT, and I think it's time,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \"It's time for me to move to the next stage.\" She added: \"You know, I've become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying 'thank you' to the company. So it's a farewell. (But) it won't be the end of me dancing. … Never say never.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the carpet Wednesday before her performance, she said: \"I feel good. I feel ready to take this next step.\" She noted that she would be continuing her work promoting diversity: \"There's so much work and effort that has to be continuous.\" Allen told reporters that Copeland had \"helped to redefine the face of ballet. She's inspired millions of people around the world and hopefully, American Ballet Theatre will not wait another 50 years before they have another beautiful Black principal dancer.\" The evening at Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater was streamed live to nearby Alice Tully Hall across the plaza, with attendance free to the public — another sign of Copeland's unique brand of fame in the dance world. Copeland was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in San Pedro, California, where she lived in near poverty and through periods of homelessness as her single mother struggled to support her and five siblings. For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late — at 13 — but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later. In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer. Unlike other promotions, which are announced quietly, Copeland's was announced at a news conference — a testament to her celebrity. Only days before, she'd made a triumphant New York debut in  Swan Lake  in the starring role of Odette/Odile, drawing a diverse and enthusiastic crowd to the Metropolitan Opera House. Trying times for DEI efforts In the AP interview, Copeland acknowledged that it's striking that when she leaves ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's definitely concerning,\" Copeland said. \"I think I've just gotten to a place in my career where there's only so much I can do on a stage. There's only so much that visual representation … can do. I feel like it's the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\" She also noted this is an especially trying moment for anyone working in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion. \"It's a difficult time,\" she said. \"And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. There's no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582442","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Starter Homes Are Scarce.

   Starter homes are scarce. But homebuyers can improve their odds \n         By Scott Neuman \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         We are asking readers and listeners  for their questions about all things homeownership and renting. Today, we're answering one of them. Submit your question below. Bidding wars  may be cooling  and mortgage rates  could dip below 6%  next year. But the shortage of \"starter homes\" — smaller, more affordable houses — continues to lock many would-be first-time buyers out of the market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gabriel Veasey, a reader in Central Texas, has children who live near Austin, Texas. They've been hunting for their first home but can't find anything affordable. He asked: Why can't they have the opportunity to buy the starter homes – the two bedroom, $200,000 [home] that's just what they need, instead of a three [bed], two [bath] or four [bed], three [bath] home for $400,000 to $500,000 that's just not within their range? … Where can my kids go? Why can't they have that opportunity to find a starter home? The housing market in Austin mirrors what's happening across the country The math doesn't work in their favor. The median income in Austin is about  $134,000  — enough for a mortgage of roughly $350,000. But in September, the median home price in Austin was about $560,000, according to  Zillow.  \"If you're a median income earner in the region, you can't afford to buy a house in the city of Austin,\" says local builder Scott Turner. Although it has slowed somewhat in recent years,  Austin remains  among the fastest-growing metros in the country and home prices have reflected that boomtown energy. But the city's housing crunch mirrors a national trend, says Mike Loftin, the CEO of Homewise, a New Mexico-based organization committed to helping first-time homebuyers. He points to Albuquerque, the largest city in his state, as an example. \"Ten years ago in Albuquerque, between 2014 and 18, about 20% of all new homes built in Albuquerque would be considered an entry-level home, a smaller, more affordable home. Today, that number is 4%,\" Loftin says. \"And this is true across the country. Home builders are not building that entry-level home.\" Supply and local regulations both play a role For decades, construction of these smaller homes has been  falling across the country . In the 1980s,  they represented about 40%  of the market, but by 2023, that percentage had dropped to just  12% . Turner says the rising cost of materials is one big reason builders are shying away from the affordable end of the market, where the profit margins are lower. \"A home that maybe used to cost $300,000 to build now costs about $450,000,\" he says, citing a 40% increase in construction materials since about 2020. The added costs from tariffs on Canadian lumber and other construction materials are expected to tack on another 7% to 10% to building costs, he says. What's more, many people who bought or refinanced during the COVID-19 pandemic are  reluctant to give up low mortgage rates  — as low as 3% — to move up into a house they would have to buy at closer to 6%. As a result, those starter homes aren't being recycled for a new generation of first-time buyers. Going back to Gabriel: The problems for his kids in Austin largely are zoning and red tape. Until two years ago, much of Austin was zoned exclusively for single-family homes, and once had one of the largest minimum lot sizes in the state, Turner says. Now, property owners  can build up to three homes  on what used to be a single-family lot, making room for more entry-level homes. But the biggest barrier to creating affordable housing remains the city's slow and expensive approval process for the construction of townhomes, condos, and new subdivisions, which can take up to two years regardless of the size of the project, he says. Turner points to Houston as a model of how to get more starter homes built — through deregulation. \"Back in the 90s, Houston started to allow very small lots … throughout its urban core and to this day, you can still go down to Houston and live in the middle of town, and still find a townhome for $400,000.\" To be sure, some existing homeowners haven't embraced  zoning changes  that promote new construction. Among other things, they argue that without formal zoning, industrial, commercial and residential uses would come into undesirably close proximity. In Austin, for instance, they have in the past  successfully sued  to block such changes. Market shifts and local initiatives could help new homebuyers out Assuming that mortgage rates do come down, there will likely be some movement in this lower end of the market, Loftin says. Being ready when the market changes is key, and he says that Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) such as his — and there are many across the country — can help. \"We do the assessment, then we do an action plan to address the barriers that you have,\" he says. \"What's the game plan for improving your credit? It's not rocket science. It's helpful because we know the system.\" \"Building a savings habit where you just have your employer just automatically deposit something, every paycheck into your savings account is super, super helpful,\" he adds. And prospective buyers don't have to put down a large amount of money, either. \"Our typical down payment from a home buyer is about 2% of the purchase price, and that includes the closing costs.\" Housing advocates have proposed initiatives aimed at increasing the number of starter homes built, though even if approved, they could take years to make a dent in the problem. There's no national plan, but states are trying out different approaches. Last year, Utah's Republican-dominated legislature  passed a bill  to provide $300 million in subsidized loans for builders and new city zoning tools in an effort to boost the construction of smaller, no-frills housing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Homewise has also proposed \"New Homes for New Mexico,\" to provide around $30,000 in direct assistance to potential homebuyers that could lower the purchase price and encourage the construction of more homes in the $300,000 range. Loftin says for builders, the subsidy means \"more buyers that can afford that home now, even with the interest rates we have today.\" New Mexico's legislature plans to take up the measure in January, Loftin says, adding that it \"appears to be gaining significant support.\" But in the meantime, starter homes can still be accessible Meanwhile, even without such measures, there are things that you can do to maximize your chances of finding a starter home that fits your budget — but those options do come with compromises. Harrison Beacher, a realtor in the Washington, D.C.-area, says he tells clients to look at home buying as a Venn diagram comparing what you want with what you can afford, where you want to live and other must-haves. \"Too many people wait for the 'dream home,' when what really changes their long-term financial story is simply getting started and making thoughtful, strategic moves over time,\" Beacher says. \"A true starter home is not about checking every box on your wish list. It is about identifying the right combination of location, affordability, and potential for appreciation,\" he says. \"You want to be close enough to the things that matter for your lifestyle and career, while staying within a price point that allows you to grow into your home instead of being stretched by it.\" Finding that perfect entry-level home might involve something realtors refer to as \"driving until you qualify,\" Turner says. In other words, if you can't find something affordable, keep looking further from the city until you can. The median home price in Austin may be way too high, but the city of Bastrop, about 30 miles southeast of Austin, is much more affordable, he says. He says the median price of a home in Bastrop in July was $336,000, about 40% lower than Austin. And for Gabriel's kids, it might make sense to look outside Austin, where homes are more affordable, and buy something now — even if it's not their dream home. Over time, they can build equity and use it to move closer to the city and what they really want. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5583519","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:24:00-20:24","title":"Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants in a push to end Ukraine war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's administration announced new sweeping sanctions targeting Russia's top oil companies—Rosneft and Lukoil—as a direct effort to pressure President Vladimir Putin into negotiating an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.

giants in a push to end Ukraine war \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 2:24 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration announced Wednesday new \"massive sanctions\" against Russia's oil industry that are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and bringing an end to Moscow's brutal war on Ukraine. The sanctions against oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil followed months of calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as bipartisan pressure on Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry, the economic engine that has allowed Russia to continue to execute the grinding conflict even as it finds itself largely internationally isolated. \"Hopefully he'll become reasonable,\" Trump said of Putin not long after the Treasury Department announced the sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies and their subsidiaries. \"And hopefully Zelenskyy will be reasonable, too. You know, it takes two to tango, as they say.\" The U.S. administration announced the sanctions as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in Washington for talks with Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the new sanctions were a direct response to Moscow's refusal to end its \"senseless war\" and an attempt to choke off \"the Kremlin's war machine.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Bessent added that the Treasury Department was prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump's effort to end the war. \"We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.\" The announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters. The attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said. At least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said. Russian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said. Rutte, in his Oval Office appearance, went out of his way to underscore that the weaponry the U.S. is selling Europe to provide to Ukraine has been essential to helping stop many attacks like the one that ravaged the kindergarten. \"We need to make sure that the air defense systems are in place, and we need the U.S. systems to do that, and the Europeans are paying for that,\" Rutte said. \"It is exactly the type of actions we needed, and the President is doing that and trying everything to get this work done.\" Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock. He said the attack targeted 10 separate regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy. Peace efforts stall Trump's efforts to end the war that started with Russia's all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Putin's refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks. Trump said Tuesday that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a \"waste of time.\" European leaders accused Putin of stalling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Meanwhile, in what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country's strategic nuclear forces. Zelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow \"only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners,\" he said. More international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing — a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine — is to take place in London. Zelenskyy credited Trump's remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin's willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns about available stocks. Russia has not made significant progress on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has taken a high toll on Russian infantry and Ukraine is short of manpower, military analysts say. Both sides have invested in long-range strike capabilities to hit rear areas. Ukraine says it hit key Russian chemical plant The Ukrainian army's general staff said its forces struck a chemical plant Tuesday night in Russia's Bryansk region using British-made air-launched Storm Shadow missiles. The plant is an important part of the Russian military and industrial complex, producing gunpowder, explosives, missile fuel and ammunition, it said. Russian officials in the region confirmed an attack but did not mention the plant. Ukraine also claimed overnight strikes on the Saransk mechanical plant in Mordovia, Russia, which produces components for ammunition and mines, and the Makhachkala oil refinery in the Dagestan republic of Russia. The Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 33 Ukrainian drones over several regions overnight, including the area around St. Petersburg. Eight airports temporarily suspended flights because of the attacks. In other developments, Zelenskyy arrived Wednesday in Oslo, Norway, and after that flew to Stockholm, where he and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson signed an agreement exploring the possibility of Ukraine buying up to 150 Swedish-made Gripen fighter jets over the next decade or more. Ukraine has already received American-made F-16s and French Mirages. Trump says Russia is on the agenda for upcoming Xi talks The U.S. president is expected to meet next week with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders travel to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Beijing has not provided Russia with direct support in the war, but has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine, according to a U.S. assessment. Trump has said he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China of 50% to 100% for its purchases of Russian petroleum. \"I think he could have a big influence on Putin,\" Trump said of Xi Jinping. Beijing has yet to confirm that Trump and Xi will meet. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94470","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-20:59","title":"This nation has the fastest rising rate of cancer cases -- and deaths -- in the world","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lebanon is experiencing the fastest rise in cancer cases and deaths globally, with a 162% increase in new cases and an 80% rise in deaths from 1990 to 2023.

in the world \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 8:49 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Ali Mokdad  stands in the heart of Beirut. Cars and trucks and motorcycles rumble everywhere. \"If you look at a car passing by, you see smoke coming out of it — that's illegal in Lebanon. But nobody enforce[s] it,\" says Mokda, the chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington. As a result, Beirut has terrible air quality and is often submerged under a blanket of exhaust. And it's not just in the big cities — vehicles belch pollution across the country. It's one reason that cancer is surging in Lebanon. Mokdad co-authored  a global survey  that revealed that the tiny nation on the Mediterranean is experiencing the fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality anywhere in the world. According to the study, published in  The Lancet , the frequency of new cancer cases in Lebanon has increased by an astounding 162% from 1990 to 2023, with cancer-related deaths increasing by 80% over that same period. In 2023, for every 100,000 people in the country, there were 233.5 new cancer cases. The news is sobering elsewhere too. The survey predicts that cancer cases and cancer deaths will continue to rise worldwide through at least 2050, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Still, Lebanon has reason to be especially alarmed. What's behind the dramatic rise in cancer in Lebanon Mokdad grew up in Lebanon before moving abroad almost 40 years ago. For him, like many here, the disease is personal. \"I'm losing cousins,\" he says. \"I'm scared. I'm losing them at a very young age. It's not only death. It's also diseases. They have so many health problems.\" There are various reasons why cancer is surging in Lebanon. A big one is air pollution from both vehicles and diesel-fueled generators that many homes and businesses use due to unreliable state electricity. In addition, \"we overuse chemicals for our agriculture,\" says Mokdad. Some of these compounds along with sewage ends up in certain rivers. \"People don't drink it but they wash their tabbouleh and their fattoush with it. They're consuming this.\" By far the biggest risk factor, however, is smoking. \"There is no more taboo about smoking,\" Mokdad says. \"Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco.\" It's gotten to the point where Mokdad keeps a set of clothes in Lebanon that he only wears there. There are no public health campaigns warning against the dangers of smoking or secondhand smoke. Instead, Mokdad says  the government  is actually in the business of  buying and selling tobacco . The inevitable result is that lung cancer rates have jumped nationwide. In addition, leukemia and pancreatic and liver cancers have risen. The increases in prostate, colon and breast cancers are all preventable through early screening and detection. The issue, says Mokdad, is that although screening is available, most people don't know to seek it out. \"Health education is a problem,\" he explains. \"If you caught [cancer] earlier,\" people wouldn't have to die. The global survey on cancer and Lebanon's troubling trends with the disease caught the attention of members of the Lebanese parliament. It's why they invited Mokdad to come talk to lawmakers and experts about his findings. Change will be a journey, a slow one at that  Earlier this month, Mokdad traveled to Beirut for the meeting, which was held inside one of the Parliament buildings. After walking through the results of the study and describing the peril that cancer poses, Mokdad suggested to the officials that Lebanon could improve its health screening, ban smoking in public spaces and launch a set of aggressive anti-tobacco ads. By way of example, he pointed to a  public health campaign  launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. a decade ago, one that the CDC and other researchers say prevented  129,100 early deaths  between 2012 and 2018. Inaya Ezzeddine is a member of parliament and a physician who ran the proceedings. She explains that any kind of government response will take time. \"It's a journey,\" she says. \"It's not something that we can implement overnight because it has to do with a lot of sectors. We have to work hard toward this political will.\" A committee will be formed to examine the data and determine which laws will need enacting or strengthening to address the problem. One of the attendees,  Iman Nuwayhid , a professor of public health at the American University of Beirut, believes that individuals should take responsibility too. \"We're accountable to making our country cleaner, reduce pollution, improve the environment,\" he says. \"Of course, the government plays a bigger role, but we have a big responsibility. Local communities again should push in that direction.\" Mokdad argues that the time is now for the government to act and support people in making the right decisions about their health. \"I know Lebanese have to deal with a lot of things,\" he says. \"But cancer is killing. Many people in the parliament said, 'I'm not surprised with this finding.' And my question: What are you doing about it? Why have you been waiting so long to take action?\" A couple blocks from the building where the meeting was held, a mother and son are seated outside, taking a break from work. The mom, 57-year-old, Najah Mourda, is smoking. She says she's recently lost several loved ones to cancer — her mother, her sister and a close friend. \"It's very dangerous and I'm afraid of it,\" she says. Mourda is hopeful that the government will do something, even while acknowledging that she shouldn't be smoking. She knows it's bad for her. She's tried to stop but hasn't been able to kick the habit. Her son, Marwan Bizri, looks on. \"Lebanese people are dying because of cancer,\" he says. \"We're losing people we love.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5470168","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"How an Oregon writer finds fulfillment in picking up litter","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mark Remy, a writer and editor from Portland, Oregon, began volunteering with SOLVE, a nonprofit founded in 1969 that combats litter and vandalism across Oregon and Washington, after growing frustrated with the amount of trash he saw in his city.

And I thought, you know what? Maybe you're right. CHANG: After looking up some organizations online, Remy signed up with Solve, a nonprofit that began in 1969 dedicated to cleaning up litter and vandalism all across Oregon. Remy took part in a cleanup organized by Solve in downtown Portland about three years ago. He's continued to take part in cleanup events ever since. REMY: They give you a trash grabber and some bags and a pair of gloves, and they send you out into the neighborhood. And you come back later with your bags full of trash, and soon after that, a hauler comes and hauls it away, and you get on with your day. It's not very glamorous, not very sexy, but picking up trash is such a gratifying way to give back to your community because you make an impact. You make a difference immediately. By the time you're done, that little corner of the world is a little bit nicer than it was before you got there. And what a great feeling. And it scratched this itch I didn't realize I had, which is that today especially, more and more, you know, the average person can feel really overwhelmed, really hopeless, really helpless. Well, here's something you can do. And is it going to change the world? No. But like I said, it's going to make your corner of the world a little bit nicer. I did not make this up myself, but I love it. No one can do everything, but everyone can do something. And I think that's a pretty powerful way to look at the world.

The unfolding drama has so far included a sweep of old internet posts, a drunken video of Platner in his underwear, and now the urgently edited tattoo.  Amid the frenzy, another Democratic candidate released his own shirtless photo to show off his arm tattoo of former President Barack Obama’s presidential campaign logo.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n A Senate race intensifies quickly Platner launched his campaign in August, but the intensity of the race ratcheted up last Monday when Gov. Janet Mills announced her entry into a race Democrats feel they must have if they are going to reclaim a Senate majority. Her entry had the backing of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who has held the Senate seat for nearly 30 years. Shortly after Mills jumped in, news began trickling out from Platner’s past. Platner, an oyster farmer who is running as a progressive, pushed back, saying the onslaught demonstrated that he wasn’t the preferred candidate of establishment Democrats.

A Celtic knot and a dog-like creature The new tattoo, completed late Tuesday, now is a Celtic knot with a dog-like creature splayed in the middle of it. The animal has four gangly legs and an elongated head with a curly tongue spiraling out.

More old Reddit posts surfaced Wednesday, with The Advocate reporting that Platner used homophobic slurs and made anti-LGBTQ+ jokes between 2018 and 2021. Platner has apologized for those comments, saying they were made after he left the Army in 2012, when he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.  He has resisted calls to  drop out of the race  and has the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills. Another primary rival, Jordan Wood, a onetime chief of staff to former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., said Wednesday that Platner should drop out because “Democrats need to be able to condemn Trump’s actions with moral clarity” and Platner “no longer can.” The National Republican Senate Committee, meanwhile, was fundraising off the controversy on Collins’ behalf. Platner said he was not ashamed to confront his past comments and actions because it reflects the lessons he needed to take to get where he is today. “I don’t look at this as a liability,” he told the AP, adding he sees it as “a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today. And I’m very proud of who I am.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Rally draws a raucous crowd During a rally in the southern Maine town of Ogunquit on Wednesday night, Platner again addressed his regret about the tattoo and the recent concerns about his history on social media. His mother, Leslie Harlow, who introduced him, also acknowledged it has been a rough week for her son, but that she has faith in his campaign to get through it. The event packed a 500 person-capacity theater and included frequent raucous applause. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A crowd watches as Democratic Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner speaks at a town hall in Ogunquit, Maine, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025.

Kushner brings to the negotiating table in the Middle East \n         By Franco Ordoñez \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Jared Kushner is back. The president's son-in-law — and former chief adviser — had said he wasn't planning to join the administration for a second time. He successfully returned to the private sector and was raking in millions in foreign investments from ties nurtured during his first stint at the White House. But then President Trump drafted him back to help secure a ceasefire in Gaza. \"We called in Jared,\" Trump told the Israeli parliament last week, recounting efforts to reach a deal. \"We need that brain on occasion. We gotta get Jared in here.\" Trump sent Kushner back to the Middle East this week, along with special envoy Steve Witkoff, to help secure the ceasefire after a weekend of deadly violence threatened the deal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a press conference on Tuesday in Israel, Kushner downplayed the fighting as expected behavior.  \"A lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other,\" Kushner said, standing alongside Witkoff and Vice President Vance. \"But what we're seeing is that things are going in accordance. Both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture.\" Kushner, Vance and Witkoff   are also in Israel to continue implementation of Phase 2 of the peace deal, which includes establishing lines of communication to reduce tensions and avoid violations of the ceasefire as well as improve systems to get more aid into Gaza. Kushner's high-profile involvement has raised ethical questions because of his deep business ties in the region. During the first Trump administration, Kushner helped broker  the historic Abraham Accords , which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Several of the foreign governments in the region have since invested billions in an investment firm, Affinity Partners, which Kushner launched after leaving the administration. Daniel Shapiro, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration, said it's fair to ask whether Kushner should be doing diplomacy in countries with which he's also doing business. \"There are reasonable questions about the ethical and conflict of interest concerns that would be associated with people doing business with governments that they are also doing diplomacy with,\" said Shapiro, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council a nonpartisan think tank. But Shapiro, as have others who worked in Democratic administrations, have also given Kushner a lot of credit, acknowledging those same relationships helped him secure this peace agreement. \"I don't think there's any question that Jared Kushner's involvement in that critical phase after that strike [by Israel] in Doha, given the relationships he has and given the experiences he had working with these governments previously, helped produce a result fairly quickly that brought about the good outcome,\" he said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Shapiro added that — especially in the Gulf countries — there are few lines between political, business and family relationships. So someone like Kushner, who has been a partner before, can return to the negotiation table with built-in trust and understanding. The White House dismisses any ethics criticism. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A senior administration official who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations told NPR that Kushner was critical to finalizing the deal, fostering relationships built through his work on the Abraham Accords. \" Special Envoy Wyckoff and the President were very grateful for his help, given his really deep understanding of the region and relationships,\" the official said. \"Steve would frequently reach out to him for input. They would bounce ideas off each other.\" The official dismissed the criticism as largely coming from those who oppose anything the president does. Kushner calls the business ties he has in the region an asset, as he told CBS's  60 Minutes  over the weekend. \"What people call conflicts of interests, Steve and I call experience and trusted relationships that we have throughout the world,\" he said. \"If Steve and I didn't have these deep relationships, the deal that we were able to help get done, that freed these hostages, would not have occurred.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581418","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:02:00-04:00","title":"Mamdani's rise in NYC reflects a generational fight within the Democratic Party","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani’s unexpected rise in the New York City mayoral race reflects a deeper generational shift within the Democratic Party, as young voters reject the establishment represented by long-serving figures like Andrew Cuomo.

Andrew Cuomo faced off in the first New York City mayoral debate of the general election, the generational battle within the Democratic Party was on full display. Cuomo was long a member of Democratic royalty, leading New York as governor for nearly 11 years after serving in the Clinton administration.  His late father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, was a Democratic Party icon.  Again and again, Cuomo hammered the idea that his deep resume makes him uniquely qualified to lead America's biggest city. \"This is no job for on-the-job training,\" Cuomo said during the Oct. 16 exchange, painting Mamdani as a political novice with left-leaning ideas outside the mainstream. \"He never has had a job. On his resume it said he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer.\" But Cuomo is running in this race as an independent after Mamdani, who turned 34 last weekend, trounced him during the Democratic Party primary. Mamdani was an unknown outside his state Assembly district until this year, but has led consistently in the general election by double-digit margins,  according to polls . \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during the debate. \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That barb pointed to the downside of Cuomo's long track record in office: It comes with some gritty political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021.  Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing. But Andres Bernal, a political analyst who lectures at the City University of New York, thinks many young voters look at Cuomo's history of controversy and are reminded of the Democratic Party establishment that has left them disillusioned.   \"It's a revolving door with a lot of corporate America, a lot of funders and lobbyists,\" he said. Bernal says Mamdani overcame Cuomo's attacks over his relatively thin resume by offering big progressive ideas, like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, that appeal to many young voters.   \"Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and I think are associated with Mamdani's youth,\" Bernal said. It seems to be working. The latest  poll by AARP and Gotham Polling  shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers, under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76% of his support is over age 50.  But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and style. When asked during the debate whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal cannabis shops, Mamdani laughed and said yes.  Cuomo offered a terse no.  Their starkly different tones have played out in social media, where Cuomo offered conventional campaign ads, often attacking Mamdani. Mamdani's campaign, meanwhile, posts upbeat, often funny and hopeful videos that regularly go viral.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate trying to do,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx.  Polanco is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas. But he says Mamdani's use of social media to reach young voters is a game changer, allowing him to overcome his relative lack of experience. \"He has rewritten the book. I love his style; he's a happy warrior,\" he said. During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging has gotten better since he lost the Democratic primary, but he acknowledged playing catch-up.  \"I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now,\" he said.   While Cuomo and Mamdani have sparred, often bitterly, across this generational party divide, the Republican in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has suggested they're closer on policy issues than their campaign rhetoric suggests. \"We have the architect and the apprentice,\" Sliwa said during the debate. Early voting is now underway. If Mamdani holds onto his lead through Election Day on Nov. 4, he will represent one more big generational change, serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but that hasn't appeared to slow Mamdani's momentum. Mamdani has picked up some  key endorsements from  Jewish leaders  in the city and a  New York Times-Siena poll last month  found most young voters in New York City sympathize more with the Palestinians than with Israel over the war in Gaza. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581401","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-04:00","title":"American 'Bibisitters' try to keep the Israel-Hamas truce on track","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which began on October 10, 2025, is largely holding despite a recent flare-up of fighting that killed two Israeli soldiers and over 40 Palestinians.

Vance is part of a high-profile U.S. team that's in Israel this week with the mission of keeping the truce on track and trying to extend it to a more challenging second phase.    Netanyahu is universally known in Israel as \"Bibi.\" The Israeli media is calling this American contingent the \"Bibisitters.\" In addition to Vance, it includes Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of U.S. Central Command. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also expected this week. For his part, Netanyahu described the meeting with Vance as an \"opportunity to make decisions jointly in a very tight-knit and trusted partnership.\" While the Americans are having wide-ranging talks with the Israelis, U.S. officials are not expected to meet Hamas. The U.S. classifies Hamas as a terrorist group, which prohibits contact. In a rare exception, Witkoff and Kushner said they met Hamas leaders in Egypt to nail down the final details of the ceasefire, which took effect Oct. 10. The truce holds, with many steps ahead The Gaza ceasefire has largely held aside from a  flare-up in fighting  last Sunday that left two Israeli soldiers and more than 40 Palestinians dead. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       However, the so-called Phase 2 of the truce deals with more difficult problems. Gaza doesn't have a government, and it's not clear when it will get one. The Hamas leadership was decimated in the war, and the  ceasefire agreement  says the group will not take part in a future government. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The agreement says 15 nonpartisan technocrats will take over on an interim basis, but there's no timetable. Asked about the lack of government in Gaza, Vance said other needs should be meet first, including food, medicine and security. \"If we get to the point where we're arguing exactly what the governing structure in Gaza is long term, we should pat ourselves on the back because that's a very good problem to have. But I won't anticipate that problem before we actually have it,\" Vance said. Vance made those remarks Tuesday in southern Israel, barely 10 miles from the Gaza border. He visited a civilian-military coordination center built in the last few days by 200 U.S. troops. This center will include officials from the U.S. and other countries, as well as aid groups and others working in Gaza. The goal is to make sure everyone is operating from the same playbook. The ceasefire plan also calls for Hamas to \"decommission\" its weapons, though the group has not publicly stated it will do this. Vance stressed that it should happen, but declined to say exactly how this would work. In addition, Israeli troops — who still control half of Gaza — are required to pull back as the territory stabilizes. Foreign troops are supposed to replace the Israelis in Gaza as an international stabilization force. However, there's no word on what countries will supply the troops, when they might arrive or exactly what their mandate would be. Israel is already making clear it will have the final say on which troops are allowed to take part in the force. Trump plays a leading role, but no troops on the ground Meanwhile, Trump has long said he will keep the U.S. out of \"forever wars.\" Yet he also sees himself as a master negotiator who's able to end wars. He's widely credited for bringing about the Gaza truce after two years of intense fighting. His administration also stresses that the 200 U.S. troops in Israel will work at the coordination center in Israel and will not go into Gaza. Still, U.S. presidents dating back to Harry Truman have sought to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And so far, none has managed a full-fledged peace. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Vice President JD Vance is in Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Vance says the Gaza ceasefire is making progress despite fighting between Israel and Hamas over the weekend. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Vance and several other U.S. officials in Israel are trying to get the two sides to take the next steps under the deal. They acknowledge it will be challenging. MARTÍNEZ: All right. Let's hear from NPR's Greg Myre in Tel Aviv. So, Greg, the ceasefire mostly is holding. So how is JD Vance describing what he's seeing? GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Yeah. The vice president says it's actually going better than he expected. We're almost two weeks in and the ceasefire is largely holding, aside from a significant flare-up of fighting last Sunday. But the next phase poses some hard problems, and we can't emphasize this enough. Gaza doesn't have a government, and it's not clear when it will get one. When asked about this, Vance said other things should happen first. The people of Gaza need food, medicine, security. And then he added... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JD VANCE: If we get to the point where we're arguing exactly what the governance structure in Gaza is long-term, then we should pat ourselves on the back. That's a very good problem to have. But I won't anticipate that problem before we actually have it. MARTÍNEZ: OK. So what is the Trump administration doing to work on these priorities that Vance has mentioned? MYRE: Vance spoke in southern Israel, just 10 miles or so from Gaza, at a civilian military coordination center built in the last few days by 200 U.S. troops. This operations center will include officials from the U.S. and other countries, as well as aid groups and others working in Gaza. The goal is to make sure everybody is operating from the same playbook. The head of the U.S. Central Command, Admiral Brad Cooper, has overseen this work, and he was there as well with Vance. So was Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Collectively, this reflects the major effort the Trump administration is making to get this ceasefire to stick. Now, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is universally known here as Bibi, and the Israeli media is calling this American contingent meeting with him Bibisitters. They have a lot of work ahead of them. This next phase calls for Hamas to give up its weapons, for Israeli soldiers to pull back and for international troops to replace them in Gaza as a stabilization force. MARTÍNEZ: The thing is, though, these ceasefires between Israel and Hamas don't have a great track record. I mean, did President Trump get ahead of himself by declaring peace in Gaza? MYRE: Well, you can certainly see some parallels to President George W. Bush in the Iraq War back in 2003. Just a few weeks into that war, Bush went aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier and essentially declared the fighting over in front of a huge banner that read, mission accomplished. And of course, the U.S. ultimately fought for many years in Iraq. That should be a cautionary tale for the Middle East. Yet at the ceasefire signing ceremony last week in Egypt, Trump stood in front of a huge banner that read, peace in the Middle East. MARTÍNEZ: But, you know, Trump has long said that he'll keep the U.S. out of what he calls our forever wars. I mean, isn't Israel and Palestine - isn't that conflict the very definition of a forever war? MYRE: Well, absolutely, A. And Trump sort of seems torn about this. He says he wants to avoid open-ended conflicts, yet he also believes he's a master negotiator who's able to end wars. He keeps saying he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, but he's very much taking ownership here of this conflict. Now, that's also true of many previous U.S. presidents, and none of them were able to forge a full-fledged Middle East peace. MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Greg Myre in Tel Aviv. Greg, thanks. MYRE: Sure thing, A. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580351","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:17:00-04:00","title":"Israel takes steps to shut down international aid groups in Gaza and the West Bank","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has introduced a sweeping policy to de-register international humanitarian organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological grounds such as accusations of supporting terrorist activities or inciting racism. The process, managed by COGAT and requiring approval from a committee that includes Israeli government representatives, has led to the denial or delay of registrations for major groups including the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that promised increased aid, Israel continues to restrict aid access, with only two of seven border crossings open. UNRWA, the primary humanitarian agency in Gaza, has been banned from sending aid since March 2025, with Israel alleging it employs Hamas members—a claim without evidence.

5:17 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         AMMAN, Jordan — Israel, having banned the United Nations aid agency for Palestinian refugees from sending aid and staff to Gaza, is now taking unprecedented steps to de-register major nongovernmental aid groups for ideological reasons, according to several officials of   humanitarian organizations. They say the new rules threaten the ability of some of the biggest international nongovernmental organizations — known as INGOs — to send in aid or staff to both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"INGOs are in limbo — most who have submitted have either been not accepted or rejected,\" an official with an aid organization that is aware of the situation said of the application process required for nongovernmental aid organizations operating in Gaza and the West Bank. The official spoke on the condition that NPR not name their employer and not give their name because they are not authorized to speak publicly. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war brokered this month by President Trump committed Israel to a surge in aid into Gaza, where food security experts  declared famine  in parts of the territory. But Israel continues to severely restrict crossings open for aid shipments and who can send aid through them. Of seven Israeli border crossings with Gaza, only two are currently open. Of those that are open, the U.N. and nongovernmental aid groups say many requests to enter Gaza are routinely rejected, without explanation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Israeli military has claimed, without providing evidence, that its aid restrictions are needed for security. On Wednesday, the International Court of Justice  said that Israel  is obligated to allow aid provided by U.N. agencies and other organizations into the Gaza Strip. The court also said Israel cannot invoke its security concerns to justify suspending humanitarian aid there.  \"As an occupying power, Israel is obliged to ensure the basic needs of the local population, including the supplies essential for their survival,\" the court said in its advisory opinion. It said that includes food, water, fuel and medical supplies. Israel's Foreign Ministry rejected the court's decision,  alleging it was a political attempt  to harm Israel under the guise of international law. Israel this fall began requiring that all international aid groups re-register  under new criteria , including approval by a committee which includes representatives from Israel's Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism. Reasons for delisting aid groups include supporting \"terrorist groups and activities in accordance with Israel law\" and \"inciting racism,\" according to COGAT, the Israeli military's arm that is part of NGO approval process. Aid organizations say the reasoning appears to be used to refer to a wide variety of comments the Israeli government classifies as antisemitic. Israel has in the past accused some aid groups and medical providers of being terrorist organizations. Israel had also demanded that organizations provide personnel details for all local and international staff, a measure rejected by most major aid groups as potentially putting staff in danger. The Norwegian Refugee Council, registered in Gaza since 2009, is one of the major aid groups unable to send in supplies or staff while its application is being considered. \"We quickly realized that the intent behind the process wasn't to facilitate the re-registration of humanitarian INGOs but rather to find a way to de-register us and to remove our ability to operate,\" says Ivan Karakashian, communications manager for the NRC in Jerusalem. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He says there were no clear guidelines as to what delegitimizing Israel included. Any de-registered organizations would have to cease operations in both Gaza and the Israeli occupied West Bank within 60 days, according to aid officials familiar with the criteria. The Israeli military arm responsible for borders and coordination with INGO operations did not respond to NPR's requests for comment on reasons for de-registering or delaying registration of some organizations. Many of those aid groups waiting to be re-registered have had hundreds of trucks waiting for months in Egypt and Jordan intended for Gaza. Humanitarian officials said at least one major U.S.-based NGO has already been de-registered and is now in the appeal process. The organization in question declined to discuss the issue with NPR. Another U.S.-based aid group, Mercy Corps, said following the ceasefire agreement, it had submitted a request to send in aid but it was denied by Israeli authorities because the organization was in the process of re-registering. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Humanitarian officials said Israel has approved a dozen NGOs that do not coordinate within traditional U.N.-led structures and are either ideologically driven or have little experience in humanitarian aid or both. They include one U.S. aid group that partnered with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a militarized aid response in which almost all other aid groups refused to participate. COGAT did not respond to a request for comment on new aid organizations given registration. At the same time, Israel continues to ban the U.N. agency for providing aid to Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, from sending in aid or staff to Gaza. Israel accused UNRWA, without evidence, of employing hundreds of Hamas members, including some involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel. It has sought since the start of the Gaza war to replace the U.N. aid system that has provided humanitarian assistance there for decades. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       UNRWA, with 12,000 local staff, was the biggest humanitarian organization in Gaza, running shelters, mobile medical clinics, water and sanitation projects and schools. \"The warehouses in Jordan and Egypt are full of food that can feed the entire population of Gaza for three months and we need to bring that in,\" says Tamara Alrifai, UNRWA's director of external relations. The supplies also include medicine, tents, blankets and hygiene products. Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed  more than 90% of homes  in Gaza and most of the civilian infrastructure, according to U.N. figures. The United States, which had been UNRWA's biggest donor, stopped its funding last year, which Alrifai says led to a loss of about one-quarter of UNRWA's total income. Alrifai says while European and other countries have increased their contributions, it does not fill the funding gap. The European Union's top humanitarian aid official said after the Israeli accusations against UNRWA  he saw no evidence from Israel  backing them. Alrifai says UNRWA was trying to start discussions with the U.S. through other countries about renewing the funding. \"We have not had direct talks but we have passed on messages through other governments who are close to Gaza and close to the U.S.\" she says. Aya Batrawy contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Israeli strikes in Gaza continue despite its military pulling back troops under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that took effect last week. Today, an attack killed a Palestinian family of 11, including seven children and three women. Israel also committed under the ceasefire to dramatically increase the amount of aid it allows in. Aid groups say that isn't happening. NPR's Jane Arraf joins us now. Jane, thanks for being with us. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Thank you, Scott. SIMON: What's happened in this attack, and what's happening with the ceasefire? ARRAF: Well, Gaza Civil Defense authorities say this was one of the many families returning to inspect the ruins of their home in Gaza City when Israeli forces fired a tank round at their minibus. The Israeli military said that the family was behind the yellow line where its troops are positioned and that they fired on it because they were an imminent threat. That yellow line, Scott, is visible on the map, we have to note, but not so much to families on the ground. And the ceasefire itself, it's still holding overall, but Israel still controls more than 50% of Gaza territory. It says it plans to mark that yellow line with a physical barrier. SIMON: Israel also pledged to allow 600 aid trucks per day into Gaza. Has that happened? ARRAF: It hasn't. The U.N. says that 600 is the bare minimum to keep people from starving, to provide shelter and repair infrastructure in what is a totally devastated territory. Israel is still keeping shut one of those main border crossings, Rafah, which is Egypt's border crossing with Gaza. And that's where many hundreds of trucks have been waiting for months to be allowed in. It has been allowing aid through two other crossings. But there, it's a bit of a numbers game because Israel refers to all trucks as aid trucks. So just to give you an example, two days ago, the figures show 950 trucks entered Gaza. But a Trump administration official shed some light on that. It appears that only about 10% of that figure were U.N. or international aid organizations, and most of the rest were commercial imports. Those are imports from Israel, by the way. SIMON: And the United Nations has urged Israel to allow the aid organization with which it partners to continue to send aid into Gaza. Help us understand that. ARRAF: Yeah. That's a huge issue which hasn't received a lot of attention. The U.N. doesn't need to be registered, but international nongovernmental organizations, INGOs, do. And Israel this year said it would shut down aid groups that didn't reregister under the new criteria, so it's begun that process. This criteria has a committee that determines whether the organizations have delegitimized Israel through statements or anything else. Here's Ivan Karakashian, the communications manager at the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem. IVAN KARAKASHIAN: We quickly realized that this wasn't - the intent behind the process wasn't to facilitate the reregistration of INGOs, of humanitarian INGOs, but rather to find a way to deregister us - right? - and to remove our ability to operate within the occupied Palestinian territory. ARRAF: He says his organization is in the process of trying to reregister, and that also applies to some of the biggest U.S. aid groups. If they don't, if they can't, that means they're shut down. SIMON: Jane, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, was the biggest provider of aid in Gaza for decades before Israel banned staff and shipments there. Is that expected to change? ARRAF: Israel hasn't given any indication it's lifting that ban. It had claimed - without evidence - that hundreds of UNRWA staff are Hamas. And the U.S. also cut funding to UNRWA. Some of that funding, but not all of it, was made up by other countries. I spoke with UNRWA's head of external relations, Tamara Alrifai, and here's what she had to say. TAMARA ALRIFAI: We still are trying to work our way back into discussions with the U.S. You know how they say it takes a village? It takes an international community to want the situation in Gaza, in the occupied Palestinian territory and in the region to be stable. ARRAF: UNRWA has been banned by Israel from sending in supplies since March. It has warehouses in Egypt and here in Jordan full of food that UNRWA says could feed the entire population of Gaza for three months. SIMON: NPR's Jane Arraf. Thanks so much. ARRAF: Thank you. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Oct. 22nd, 2025 \n         An earlier version of this story incorrectly quoted Ivan Karakashian, communications manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem, as saying the process of re-registration of humanitarian nongovernmental organizations in Israel was an attempt to “re-register” them. Karakashian actually said it was an attempt to “de-register” them. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/melania-trump-michael-wolff-lawsuit-epstein-e5a52952be556d2976d5aeaf6e40b1db","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:42:37+00:00","title":"Wolff Sues Melania Trump Over Epstein Allegations, Claims Threat of $1 Billion Damages","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Author Michael Wolff has filed a lawsuit against First Lady Melania Trump and President Donald Trump, claiming they threatened to sue him for over $1 billion if he did not retract statements about their connection to Jeffrey Epstein.

Wolff sought unspecified damages in the lawsuit filed Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Nicholas Clemens, a spokesperson for Melania Trump, issued a statement, saying: “First Lady Melania Trump is proud to continue standing up to those who spread malicious and defamatory falsehoods as they desperately try to get undeserved attention and money from their unlawful conduct.” In his lawsuit, Wolff said Melania Trump and her husband,  President Donald Trump , “have made a practice of threatening those who speak against them” with costly legal actions “to silence their speech, to intimidate their critics generally, and to extract unjustified payments and North Korean style confessions and apologies.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He said the threats “are designed to create a climate of fear in the nation so that people cannot freely or confidently exercise their First Amendment rights.” According to the lawsuit, the threats are also meant to shut down inquiry into the couple’s involvement with  Epstein , the notorious financier who killed himself in a New York federal jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Melania Trump demands Hunter Biden retract ‘extremely salacious’ Epstein comments \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The lawsuit came on the day that Melania Trump’s lawyer had set as a deadline for Wolff to retract statements, issue an apology and pay damages to his client. \n    \n     ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n The lawyer, Alejandro Brito, wrote on Oct. 15 that she would be “left with no alternative” but to sue for over $1 billion after the statements had caused her “overwhelming reputational and financial harm.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Through his lawsuit, Wolff announced his intention to use the legal action to put the president and his wife under oath to answer questions about Epstein.

Others, the lawsuit said, were protected speech. For instance, the statement that the Trumps were in a “sham marriage, trophy marriage,” was a “fair and justified” statement of opinion, it said. The lawsuit noted that Wolff never said Melania Trump was involved in any of Epstein’s crimes. Among the statements the lawsuit said were true were those saying Melania Trump was “very involved” in Epstein’s social circle, where she met her future husband, and that Donald Trump liked to have sex with his friend’s wives and first slept with Melania Trump on Epstein’s private jet. The lawsuit said it was fair to question how Melania Trump fits into the Epstein story. And, it added, it was proper to “find out what happened in Mr. Trump’s and Epstein’s 10 years of pursuing models, including supermodels, runway models, catalog models, Eastern European models, and girls who just dreamed of being models.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n According to the lawsuit, that subject “will be one of the zones of inquiry that this lawsuit will have to undertake.” Wolff conducted interviews with Epstein before his death.

advance Trump's redistricting fight into swing-state North Carolina \n         By Adam Wagner \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 1:49 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina has become the first swing state to draw new congressional districts amid a nationwide arms race between Republicans and Democrats to secure additional seats ahead of next year's midterm election. President Trump initiated the mid-decade battle to help the GOP keep control of the U.S. House. In North Carolina, Republican legislative leaders  announced last week  they wanted to redraw the map with the aim of winning 11 of the state's 14 congressional districts. The GOP currently controls 10 of the seats. To accomplish that, Republicans focused on the 1st Congressional District, in the northeastern corner of the state. The 1st is the state's only swing district and has been represented by Black lawmakers for decades, most recently two-term U.S. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat. \"These maps are a political weapon\" The map moves six coastal counties and some precincts in another county into the 1st Congressional District, making it more conservative. In return, four agriculture-oriented counties around Goldsboro, Kinston and Wilson are shifted into the 3rd District. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Opponents argue that the new map dilutes the voting power of Black residents in eastern North Carolina. \"These maps are a political weapon, and Black voters are the target,\" said Sen. Kandie Smith, who along with all 19 of her Democratic colleagues formally protested the new map Monday. The proportion of Black voters in the prior 1st District was about 40%, higher than any other in the state. That drops to 32% under the new map, while the proportion of Black voters in the 3rd District only rises to 29%. Republicans have maintained they are drawing the new districts to help their political party. \"Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives,\" state Sen. Ralph Hise, who drew the new map with help from staff, told a legislative committee on Monday. \"And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump's agenda.\" The GOP rationale is likely an attempt to get ahead of lawsuits, said Chris Cooper, director of Western Carolina University's Haire Institute for Public Policy. Both North Carolina courts and the U.S. Supreme Court have ruled in recent years that they will not overturn maps on the basis of partisan gerrymandering but could if a map represents a racial gerrymander. (The U.S. Supreme Court  may soon rule differently  on racial gerrymanders.) \"If [North Carolina Republicans] can say that partisanship part out loud, I think they probably think that puts them on even better, firmer grounds,\" Cooper said. More congressional maps than elections Redistricting has become a near-constant in North Carolina politics. Typically, redistricting only happens at the beginning of a decade, after new census results. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But lawsuits and court rulings have meant that the map just passed is the state's seventh congressional map since 2016, and the fifth version this decade. That's more maps than elections. Unlike most of the other maps, the North Carolina General Assembly decided to draw this latest one. In most other cases, either state or federal courts directed it to draw new districts in response to claims of partisan or racial gerrymandering. The most recent congressional map follows a 2023 ruling by a new GOP majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court, which  reversed a previous decision  finding a map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering. That 2023 ruling set the stage for the general assembly to do away with a map that had resulted in seven Republicans and seven Democrats in Congress, in favor of a 2024 map that made three additional seats safely Republican. Part of a national arms race The Republican-led North Carolina House gave final approval to the plan Wednesday, after passage in the state Senate. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, can't veto redistricting proposals. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The new North Carolina map has become part of a larger congressional redistricting battle. At Trump's urging, Texas started the fight earlier this year, with GOP lawmakers there redrawing maps to shift five seats toward their party. California responded by putting a referendum on the state's ballot in November that, if passed, would shift five seats toward Democrats. Meanwhile, Republicans in Missouri redrew their districts to shift one seat toward the GOP, although there is  an effort underway  to secure enough signatures to require that voters approve the new map in a referendum. Republicans have their sights on other states, including Indiana and Kansas. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The mid-decade redistricting battle between the two major political parties has now moved to the swing state of North Carolina. This is a battle President Trump is waging to help Republicans hold the U.S. House. And in North Carolina, GOP lawmakers are hoping to pick up one more congressional seat. The North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner is in Raleigh, and he joins us now with the latest. Hey, Adam. ADAM WAGNER, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So give us a little primer. What's the plan in North Carolina? WAGNER: Sure. Republicans are targeting North Carolina's 1st Congressional District. That's represented by Don Davis, a moderate Democrat. It's also the only swing district in the state, and Davis has narrowly won it twice. The new map basically swaps a total of 10 counties between the 1st and the 3rd Districts, and if it goes into effect, Republicans would have a clear advantage in 11 of North Carolina's 14 congressional districts. KELLY: Eleven of the 14 seats - and I just called North Carolina a swing state. I mean, it basically is a swing state. That's pretty remarkable. WAGNER: It is, yeah. So this is a state that President Donald Trump has won three times, but at the same time, it elected Democratic governors all three times. And North Carolina's governor can't veto redistricting proposals. What's kind of striking about this particular one is how quickly it's moved. Republican leaders announced their plan last Monday, and it's moving through the legislature this week. KELLY: And Republican lawmakers, when you ask them what's the rationale, what do they tell you? WAGNER: They've been pretty clear. This is to help the GOP hold the House and to boost the Trump administration agenda. Here's Senate Republican leader Phil Berger answering questions on the Senate floor yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL BERGER: The redrawing of District 1 was done based on a political calculation and a determination that that district could be redrawn for a Republican to have a better chance of winning. That's the only reason it was done. WAGNER: There's some thought that insisting that this gerrymandering is being done for partisan reasons is an attempt to get ahead of the lawsuits that everybody's expecting. Both state and federal courts have said that they can't overturn maps because they offer one party or the other an unfair advantage. KELLY: And what do Democrats say to all this, Adam? WAGNER: So all 20 Democratic members of the North Carolina Senate have formally protested the bill. And during debate yesterday, they argued that this new map splits up a bloc of Black voters in rural North Carolina. Here's Senator Kandie Smith. She represents the area around Greenville, North Carolina. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KANDIE SMITH: These maps are a political weapon, and Black voters are the target. This bill and these maps are designed to fracture historic coalitions, diminish voter turnout and protect incumbents at the expense of the will of the people. WAGNER: The racial elements of this new map will likely be the crux of any lawsuit against it. Republicans are insisting that they didn't consider racial data when they were drawing this map. But the 1st District has elected Black lawmakers to Congress for 32 consecutive years, and the new map moves a significant proportion of Black voters out of that district. So right now, about 40% of voters in the 1st are Black. That's the highest of any congressional district in the state. And this new map would drop that to about 32%. KELLY: And just by way of backdrop, we're talking about the new map, but one thing that is striking is how many new maps North Carolina has had - how often the map has changed there over the last decade, right? WAGNER: Yeah. Redistricting is basically a near constant in North Carolina politics. Because of lawsuits and court orders, the map that's now under consideration would be the state's seventh congressional map since 2016... KELLY: Wow. WAGNER: ...And the fifth version this decade. And just to be clear, that's more maps than there have been elections. What's different here is that typically, state or federal courts have told the general assembly to draw a new map because of claims of partisan or racial gerrymandering. But lawmakers are doing it this time on their own - they say to help Trump. KELLY: That is North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner. Thank you, Adam. WAGNER: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94489","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"14:19:00-20:00","title":"After months of the same songs on the Hot 100, 'Billboard' tweaks its rules","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Billboard has updated its Hot 100 chart rules to reduce the longevity of songs on the chart by introducing stricter drop-off thresholds: a song must fall below No. 5 after 78 weeks (1.5 years), below No. 10 after 52 weeks, and below No. 25 after 26 weeks.

The measure,  intended to  shorten the amount of time successful songs spend on the Hot 100, knocks 10 tracks off this week's chart — including Swims' \"Lose Control,\" which spent more than two years on the Hot 100 — and in the process cements a record that could take a decade to surpass. Billboard  has long had a problem with streaming — as well as with radio stations' growing reluctance to pull hit songs from heavy rotation after many, many months. When you look at the list of the songs with the longest-ever runs on the Hot 100 (a chart whose history dates back to 1958), they're all from the streaming era. Streaming services use algorithms that feed people songs they've already played, and that's created a doom loop that's allowed recent-vintage songs like  The Weeknd 's \"Blinding Lights\" (90 weeks on the Hot 100),  Glass Animals ' \"Heat Waves\" (91 weeks) and Swims' \"Lose Control\" (112 weeks) to stay on the chart for absurdly long runs. Until this week,  Billboard  employed a system that seemed reasonable enough: Songs were pulled from the Hot 100 if they'd dropped below No. 25 after 52 weeks, or below No. 50 after 20 weeks. That generally prevented the chart's lower reaches from getting crowded with stubborn-but-declining hits — endlessly charting smashes like  Post Malone 's \"I Had Some Help (feat.  Morgan Wallen )\" and  Shaboozey 's \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" finally dropped off the chart in recent months thanks to this system — but didn't have an answer for songs that just weren't descending far enough or quickly enough. Effective this week, the thresholds have moved dramatically, in ways that will reshape the charts in the months and years to come. Now, if a song drops below No. 5 after 78 weeks — a year and a half! — it's gone. (Consider that \"Lose Control\" sat at No. 6 before  The Life of a Showgirl  came along.) If a song drops below No. 10 after 52 weeks, it's gone. If it drops below No. 25 after 26 weeks? Bzzzt. And if it drops below No. 50 after 20 weeks? That's a wrap. Billboard  is reserving the right to bend its own rules and keep songs on the chart beyond those benchmarks on a case-by-case basis, and you can see a handful of exceptions on this week's chart. Most notably,  Billie Eilish 's \"Wildflower\" — the longest-charting song left on the Hot 100 — is in its 70th week on the chart and sits at No. 50. But, while it's lasted way more than 26 weeks, it's actually  climbing , jumping from No. 63. Also, once the holidays roll around, the usual chestnuts won't be held to precisely the same standards, provided they rank at No. 50 or higher, same as in previous years. So be sure to take a moment, light a candle and pause to reflect on such once-immortal, now-vanquished eternals as…  [lights dim as a screen bears the words \"In Memoriam\"]   Lady Gaga  and  Bruno Mars ' \"Die With a Smile\" (60 weeks),  Benson Boone 's \"Beautiful Things\" and \"Sorry I'm Here for Someone Else\" (89 and 32 weeks, respectively), Morgan Wallen's \"I'm the Problem\" and \"Just in Case\" (36 and 29 weeks, respectively) and  Kendrick Lamar 's \"Luther (feat.  SZA )\" (46 weeks), as well as songs by  sombr  and  BigXthaPlug . We'll never know how long they might have lasted under the old system — except in the case of \"Lose Control,\" which we can state with virtual certainty would have left the Hot 100 sometime after the next Ice Age. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1226911278","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"14:45:00Z","title":"Scientists Can Tell How Fast You're Aging.

Now, the trick is to slow it down \n         By Allison Aubrey \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 2:45 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         I used to flinch at the topic of aging. Is there anything we can do about the inevitable? But recently I've been digging into a new wave of longevity research that is making it an exciting time to be an aging human — which is all of us. It turns out, we all age at varying rates. Super-agers may have great genes, but research shows our habits and routines — everything from what we eat and how we move our bodies to who we spend our time with — matter a lot, when it comes to aging well. Now, the next frontier is to target the basic biology of aging and come up with new interventions to slow it down. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many scientists are optimistic that we're on the cusp of breakthroughs. Not only to help us live longer, but — more importantly — to extend the number of years we live with good health. This is the goal of researchers at the  Human Longevity Lab  at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. They're recruiting study participants so they can test what kinds of interventions may slow the rate of aging. To that end, I decided to roll up my sleeve for science. Welcome to aging: My visit to the longevity lab When I arrived, the first step was a quick blood draw. The Potocsnak Longevity Institute is housed on the light-filled 21st floor of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, overlooking Lake Michigan. It felt more like a spa than a doctor's office. I didn't anticipate the vast range of data and insights scientists could glean from a battery of tests. Over a four-hour period, they performed more than two dozen assessments. At first it felt a bit like an annual physical. They checked my blood pressure, weight, glucose and cholesterol. But then, the tests got a lot more interesting. Inside a small exam room, a medical assistant opened the hinge of a  BodPod , a capsule that looks like a submersible. The machine assessed my body composition, determining the ratio of fatty mass to lean mass, which includes muscle. Strength is a key marker of healthy aging, helping us fend off frailty and falls. Next, I was asked to sniff and identify a range of distinct smells — from leather to chocolate — to test olfactory function. The loss of smell can be an  early sign of disease and cognitive decline . They scanned my retina and took digital images of the inside of my eyes, which can also help detect disease. And I took a memory and cognitive function test, called  MOCA . Thankfully, all was healthy. Then I went through a slew of cardiovascular health tests. They measured my  endothelial function,  which keeps blood flowing smoothly through the body. They looked at my heart rate variability and pulse-wave velocity, which is an indicator of stiffness of the arteries. I had electrodes placed onto my chest for an electrocardiogram. Midway through I was feeling a bit nervous, and my mind raced to  what ifs.  Of all the tests they performed, the most intriguing is the  GrimAge test . This test predicts  biological  age. It's gauging whether your DNA age is younger, or older, than your actual age, known as chronological age. Conjure images of the Grim Reaper? Yep, that's the idea: The test can estimate how quickly, or slowly, you're aging. To figure this out, researchers use a technique based on  DNA methylation,  which is a measure of modifications in our DNA. Basically, as we age, compounds called  methyl groups  attach to some of our DNA molecules, which can turn genes on or off. Researchers have shown that the higher the proportion of methylated DNA in certain locations, the more accelerated a person's biological age. Published research suggests this is a  reliable way to predict life span and health span . Can you change your biological age? No one wants to find out they're aging faster than their peers, right? But here's the exciting part. Our biological age may be malleable. The hope is that we can slow down our rate of aging — by making changes to lifestyle. Down the line, there may be anti-aging pills or other interventions. For researchers, the GrimAge test isn't just a way to estimate DNA age. It's a tool to study whether interventions can alter it. \"That's the big ray of optimism that comes through all of this — the possibility that we can slow down aging and extend the health span of people,\" says Dr.  Douglas Vaughan , director of the Longevity Institute. Health span is the number of years we live with good health. \"It can be changed very rapidly in experimental models and probably in people, too,\" he says. For example, smoking has a very strong effect on methylation. \"Tens of thousands of locations gain methylation when you smoke,\" explains researcher  Steve Horvath,  who developed the  epigenetic clock  used as part of the GrimAge test. People with obesity also exhibit higher methylation at certain locations. \"Conversely, if you eat vegetables, if you are lean, if you exercise, that slows methylation age,\" he explains. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Now, of course, it's long been known that smoking and eating poorly are bad for you. But researchers can now test specific interventions to see if it's possible to move the needle. Vaughan's deep interest in aging took off when he identified a distinct genetic variant in an Amish community in Indiana. People who have the variant are protected from diabetes and have healthier cardiovascular systems compared to people who don't. In the laboratory, when Vaughan engineered mice to have only a 50% level of a protein associated with this mutation, their life spans increased by nearly fourfold. \"This was a eureka moment,\" he says. He tells his current medical students that in their careers they will prescribe interventions to slow down biological aging in their patients. \"I don't know exactly what that's going to be. It might be a drug. It might be a lifestyle intervention, for all I know it might be gene editing,\" Vaughan says. \"But there are going to be ways that we are going to slow down this process and give people a longer health span.\" Democratizing aging People who live in the upscale Chicago neighborhood where the Human Longevity Lab is located can expect to live a much longer, healthier life compared to people who live just a few miles away. Vaughan wants to help close this gap. \"I'm worried about the poor soul in south Chicago who has a life expectancy of 55, compared to 92 in the neighborhood where we're standing right now,\" he says. A stunning difference of more than 30 years. (You can check out life expectancy in your ZIP code  here .) A lot of factors play into this life expectancy gap including   poverty, housing, stress  and crime, which can all work against health span. Vaughan and his collaborators are enrolling people from a wide range of ages, ethnic groups, neighborhoods and socioeconomic status to see what works to slow biological aging for everybody. \"There are lots of people who've been dealt a bad hand with regard to aging,\" Vaughan says. Their goal is to find affordable, evidence-based interventions that can benefit everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. For example, he and his team are studying stress,   which Vaughan says could be \"part of the reason for the discrepancy in the life expectancy in different neighborhoods of Chicago.\"   They have begun a study to measure people's biological age at baseline, have them try a  stress-reduction  program, and test again to see if their results changed. Vaughan is also interested in studying people with chronic HIV, who tend to age at an accelerated rate. A charitable gift from a Chicago family with a shared interest helped  launch the institute.  Vaughan's team is considering a range of interventions to test whether they can slow down aging in this population. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It might be  weight training , it might be  intermittent fasting,  it might be dietary manipulations, it might be drugs that are available now that might have  anti-aging effects,\"  Vaughan explains, citing the diabetes drug metformin. Longevity and health span research is attracting lots of funding and attention, from places like the  Hevolution Foundation , which provides grants and early stage investments, and  Altos Labs , a biotechnology company, founded by  Dr. Rick Klausner , which is investigating ways to reprogram or rejuvenate cells. Over 600 competing teams from more than 50 countries have entered  a $101 million X-PRIZE global competition  focused on treatments that support healthy longevity — everything from lifestyle interventions to biologic therapies, drugs, medical devices, nutraceuticals and functional foods \"Teams have to come to the starting line and we're going to set up the frameworks by which they prove their therapeutic works,\" says XPRIZE's  Jamie Justice , who is also a researcher at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Embracing aging science Fortunately, my GrimAge score came back younger than my actual age, though I did get some surprises. I learned that my body composition isn't optimal. Turns out, I need to build more lean muscle mass, which is pretty common as we age — especially for women. With muscle mass, if you  don't use it, you lose it . After the age of 30 muscle can slowly start to decline. And, if you don't do strength training after age 65 or so, this loss can accelerate. So it's never too soon to start building a reserve. My goal for this year is to build muscle through resistance training and an optimal diet. And also, to reduce stress.

Today, NPR is starting a new project, How to Thrive as You Age. And Allison Aubrey kicks it off with a visit to a longevity lab. DOUGLAS VAUGHAN: Are you ready for this? ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: I am not sure. Should I be doing this? VAUGHAN: I think you should. I think you'll find it interesting and maybe insightful for what your future might be about. FADEL: Oh, my gosh. What are you doing there, Allison? Allison is joining us now. (LAUGHTER) FADEL: And you sound kind of hesitant. What is happening? AUBREY: Good morning, Leila. Well, we all age at different rates. And Dr. Doug Vaughan, who you just heard there, leads the Human Longevity Lab at Northwestern University in Chicago, where they can measure your rate of aging. Are you a super-ager, more likely to live to 100 or beyond, an average ager or is your aging accelerated? Now, to figure this out, they put you through a whole bunch of tests. One of them is called the grim age test. FADEL: OK, well, that doesn't sound very good. Can they call it something else? (LAUGHTER) AUBREY: It actually gives you a prediction or indicator of your biological age. So we all know our chronological age. That's the date on your birth certificate. But our biological age is a gauge of how well your cells, your DNA are holding up, how well your muscles and cardiovascular system are holding up. FADEL: OK, so now I understand why you're nervous. If you get bad news, you're aging fast... AUBREY: Right. FADEL: ...Is there anything you can do? And are you aging? What is your - are you a super-ager? AUBREY: (Laughter) Well, we'll find out. I mean, some of this is definitely beyond our control, right? But let me give you an example of information that can be helpful. One of the tests I did was in a device called a BodPod. It's a capsule. It looks like a little marine submersible that you got to climb into. And I started to feel claustrophobic the moment the medical assistant, Jessica Garcia (ph), opened the door. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SQUEAKING) JESSICA GARCIA: Before you jump in, let me point out that blue button to the side there. That stops the test if you wish to for whatever reason. AUBREY: OK. GARCIA: OK? VAUGHAN: You see the Titanic, hit that button. GARCIA: Yeah (laughter). AUBREY: OK. All right. So over the course of a few minutes, the BodPod measures your body composition, gives you a ratio of body fat to lean mass, including muscle. And the reason it's helpful to know about muscle mass is that as we age, we all start to lose muscle, as early as age 30. It happens at different rates, so maintaining strength is really key. It's a key way to prevent the risk of falls, which is the top cause of death from injury for older people. And so this test tells you how you stack up. FADEL: OK. So once you go into the BodPod and you get all this information, what do you do with that information? AUBREY: Well, in the case of, say, what you learn in the BodPod, if you need to build muscle, you can do resistance training. That is the key thing. You can make some changes to your diet. And this is actually the big goal of the Longevity Lab. The idea is that if they gather this baseline data on body composition - strength, cardiovascular function, biological age - on a whole bunch of people, then they can run tests, clinical studies to figure out which things may slow down aging. VAUGHAN: It's a healthspan prolongation lab. We want to push back the onset of aging-related disease. That's our fundamental goal. AUBREY: And Dr. Vaughan and a lot of other researchers in this space are optimistic that by targeting the basic biology of aging, they can eventually figure out how to prevent or really delay some of the common diseases that accelerate as we age, diabetes, heart disease and many more. FADEL: OK, so how do they plan to do that? AUBREY: Well, they're recruiting a mix of people of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, incomes, people who live in low-income neighborhoods. They'll get baseline measurements to gauge their rate of aging using these biomarkers and these tests, then they will test interventions that have the potential to slow it down. One population Dr. Vaughan plans to study are people with chronic HIV, who tend to age at an accelerated pace, and he wants to test a bunch of different things. VAUGHAN: It might be weight training, it might be intermittent fasting, it might be dietary manipulations. It might be drugs that are available now that might have anti-aging effects like Metformin or even Ozempic. But we want to see if we can't actually slow down the pace of aging. AUBREY: Now, in recent years, life expectancy has dipped in the U.S., but not for everyone, Leila. Life expectancy is very much influenced by where we live. The Longevity Lab is in an upscale neighborhood near fine dining, gyms, expensive apartments. People in this high-income neighborhood can expect to live a much longer life compared to people who live just a few miles away. VAUGHAN: I'm worried about the poor soul in South Chicago who's got a life expectancy of 55 compared to 92 in the neighborhood that we're standing in right now. FADEL: Allison, that's more than a 30-year difference just based on where you live. AUBREY: Yeah, it's stunning. And a lot of factors play into this. I mean, poverty, housing, crime, stress, all of these can shorten lifespan and lead to diseases earlier in life. And these societal issues are very challenging to address. But Dr. Vaughan says the goal of researchers is to figure out ways to intervene early. VAUGHAN: We know that aging is the most important risk factor for every disease that we deal with in adult human beings. And if we could slow down the pace of aging just a little bit, we can give people a few more healthy years, a few more years to enjoy their life, push back the onset of the heart disease or cancer or whatever it might be. And that's for everybody. That's not for the 1%. FADEL: OK, so I think my first question is now my last question. What did you learn personally, Allison, at the Longevity Lab? AUBREY: Well, I learned I need to be focused on building muscle, on building strength. And stress is something I need to work on, too, that may be working against longevity. VAUGHAN: We have the tools now to be able to answer that question - does stress drive an acceleration in your biological age? Maybe that's part of the reason for the discrepancy in life expectancy in different neighborhoods of Chicago, different kinds of stresses. We could bring people in and we could measure their biological age at baseline and then have them do a de-stressing protocol - meditation, yoga - as a way to slow aging. But let's do the measures. AUBREY: Eventually, Dr. Vaughan says, with all of the research going on into healthy aging, he's optimistic that there will be breakthroughs to kind of move us towards preventing or delaying the onset of many age-related diseases. FADEL: OK. Well, I'm looking forward to more of your reporting. NPR's Allison Aubrey. Thanks, Allison. AUBREY: Thank you, Leila. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/louvre-museum-theft-paris-jewels-b1fb405f231e190a4fc0c272a819186f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:41:20+00:00","title":"Louvre Director Acknowledges 'Terrible Failure' After Crown Jewel Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre in Paris suffered a daring daylight heist on Sunday, October 20, 2025, in which eight crown jewels from the Apollo Gallery — including items linked to Empress Eugénie, Marie-Amélie, and Marie-Louise — were stolen in less than four minutes.

daylight crown jewel heist  over the weekend, and said that she offered to resign but it was refused. The world’s most-visited museum reopened earlier in the day to long lines beneath its landmark glass pyramid for the first time since one of the  highest-profile museum thefts  of the century stunned the world with its audacity and scale. In testimony to the French Senate, Louvre director Laurence des Cars said that the museum had a shortage of security cameras outside the monument and other ″weaknesses″ exposed by Sunday’s theft. Under heavy pressure over a heist that stained France’s global image, she testified to a Senate committee that she submitted her resignation, but that the culture minister refused to accept it. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Today we are experiencing a terrible failure at the Louvre, which I take my share of responsibility in,” she said.

She said that the museum’s alarms had worked properly, but that it currently doesn’t have full video surveillance of the perimeter outside the museum, though there is a plan to provide full coverage of all the Louvre’s facades.  She also suggested barriers to prevent vehicles from parking directly alongside the museum’s buildings, and said that she would push for a police station inside the museum, which welcomes 30,000 visitors a day and 2,300 workers.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Disbelief among visitors Three days on, the jewels remain missing and the thieves are still at large — and reactions are divided. “For a place like the Louvre, it’s unfathomable,” said Amanda Lee, 36, an art teacher from Chicago. “I heard it took under four minutes. How is that possible here, with no police in sight?”  Others were unperturbed.  Claire Martin, a 41-year-old French lawyer from Versailles visiting with her two children during a school holiday, said that “we saw the masterpieces” even though the Apollo Gallery was shut. “We told the kids it’s a history lesson. We came for the art,” she said. “The police can deal with the thieves.” France acknowledges failings Authorities say the thieves spent less than four minutes inside the Louvre on Sunday morning: a freight lift was wheeled to the Seine-facing facade, a window was forced open and two vitrines were smashed.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Then came the getaway on motorbikes through central Paris. Alarms had gone off, drawing agents to the gallery and forcing the intruders to bolt.  As it reopened, the Louvre declined questions from The Associated Press to detail any reinforced protocols. It said that no uniformed police were posted in the corridors. With school holidays swelling demand, the day was fully booked and access limited. “I didn’t notice extra security — guards as always, and no police inside.

She warned that the thieves would be unlikely to realize anything close to that sum if they pry out stones or melt the metals — a fate curators fear would pulverize centuries of meaning into anonymous gems for the black market. Beccuau said that expert analyses are underway; four people have been identified as being present at the scene, and roughly 100 investigators are mapping the crew and any accomplices, in addition to forensics experts.

Protection for headline works is airtight — the “Mona Lisa” is behind bulletproof glass in a climate-controlled case — yet the break-in exposed seams elsewhere in a 33,000-object labyrinth. For many French, the contrast is a public embarrassment at the landmark. It touches a raw nerve: the issue of swelling crowds and overstretched staff.  In June, a staff walkout over  overcrowding and chronic understaffing  delayed opening. Unions argue that mass tourism leaves security lacking and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight access and visitor flows intersect. On Wednesday, the Louvre’s other star attractions — from the Venus de Milo to the Winged Victory of Samothrace — were open again. But the cordoned-off vitrines in the Apollo Gallery, guarded and empty, told a different story: one of a breach measured not just in minutes and euros, but in the fragility of a nation’s patrimony. ___ Angela Charlton contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/sonya-massey-shooting-trial-sean-grayson-police-ef91c35e7d6823a06639cdb243792a53","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"04:02:34+00:00","title":"Illinois Deputy Sean Grayson Faces Murder Charges in Shooting Death of Sonya Massey","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile murder trial, former Sangamon County Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson is accused of fatally shooting 36-year-old Black woman Sonya Massey in her Springfield home on July 6, 2024, during a confrontation over a pot of hot water.

Massey, who had mental health problems, had called 911 about a suspected prowler.  “She’s a little scattered, but she’s nice and kind and talking to him and you’ll see that interaction,” Milhiser said during opening statements. “You will see what happens when the defendant gets mad at a woman who is in her kitchen and has called for help. He gets mad and shoots and kills her without lawful justification.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the murder trial of an Illinois sheriff deputy who killed Sonya Massey \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Sonya Massey shooting prompts Illinois law requiring disclosure of police recruits’ backgrounds \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “He did not follow his training.

In the subsequent commotion, he fired three shots,  striking her just below the eye .  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     This January 2025 booking photo provided by the Macon County jail shows Sean Grayson, a former Sangamon County Sheriff’s deputy who is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Sonya Massey in Springfield, Ill.

Farley said that after Grayson was indicted he sought to amend his statement to the Illinois State Police to “clarify” that it was Grayson’s response, not the hot water, that rattled him and that it was an oven mitt, not the pot, that Massey held chest-high. At the time, Farley was serving a one-year probationary period and subject to firing for any reason. He said his union representative advised against further state police contact. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Earlier, Illinois State Police Lt.

It followed another strike Tuesday night, also in the eastern Pacific, that killed two people, Hegseth posted on social media hours earlier. The attacks were departures from the seven previous U.S. strikes that  had targeted vessels  in the Caribbean Sea. They bring the death toll to at least 37 from attacks that began last month. The strikes represent an expansion of the military’s targeting area as well as a shift to the waters off South America where much of the cocaine from the world’s largest producers is smuggled. Hegseth’s social media posts also drew a  direct comparison between the war on terrorism  that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration’s crackdown. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding “there will be no refuge or forgiveness — only justice.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Vance criticizes Israel’s parliament vote on West Bank annexation, says the move was an ‘insult’ \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Vance denies the US dictates to Israel as he meets with Netanyahu over Gaza ceasefire \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Japan says it plans to tell Trump it will build up military and upgrade security strategy \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Later Wednesday, he referred to the alleged drug-runners as “the ‘Al Qaeda’ of our hemisphere.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Republican President Donald Trump has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in  an “armed conflict” with drug cartels  and proclaiming the criminal organizations unlawful combatants, relying on the same legal authority used by President George W.

And we’ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we’re doing when we come to the land.” Lawmakers from both political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details.  Appearing alongside Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended such strikes, saying, “If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump said the strikes he is ordering are meant to save Americans and “the only way you can’t feel bad about it ... is that you realize that every time you see that happen, you’re saving 25,000 lives.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen as Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025, in Washington.

Several seconds into the video, the boat explodes and is seen floating motionless on the water in flames. The second video shows another boat moving quickly before being struck by an explosion. Video apparently recorded after the explosion shows packages floating in the water. The U.S. military has built up an unusually large  force in the Caribbean Sea  and the waters off the coast of Venezuela since this summer, raising speculation that Trump  could try to topple  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Maduro faces  charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S. In his posts on the strikes, Trump has repeatedly argued that illegal narcotics and the drug fentanyl carried by the vessels have been poisoning Americans. While the bulk of American overdose deaths are from fentanyl, the drug is transported by land from Mexico. Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, but the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean, is the primary area for smuggling cocaine. Colombia  and Peru, countries with coastlines on the eastern Pacific, are the world’s top cocaine producers.  Wedged between them is Ecuador , whose world-class ports and myriad maritime shipping containers filled with bananas have become the perfect vehicle for drug traffickers to move their product. The administration has  sidestepped prosecuting any occupants  of alleged drug-running vessels after returning two survivors of an earlier strike to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ecuadorian officials later said  they released the man who was returned because they had no evidence he committed a crime in their country. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listens as President Donald Trump speaks before a lunch with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Washington.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was alarmed and angry about a lack of information on the strikes. “Expanding the geography simply expands the lawlessness and the recklessness in the use of the American military without seeming legal or practical justification,” Blumenthal said. He said the way to target trafficking would be stopping the boats and interrogating those aboard to find the source of the drugs, “not just destroy the smugglers who are likely to be at the bottom of the smuggling chain.” The Republican-controlled Senate recently  voted down  a Democratic-sponsored  war powers  resolution, mostly along party lines, that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes. Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he’s met with Rubio. “He has researched the legal ramifications carefully and he believes we’re on solid ground in attacking these narcoterrorists,” Kennedy said. “I trust his judgment.” ___ Associated Press writers Will Weissert and Kevin Freking in Washington and Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/mark-sanchez-stabbing-indianapolis-colts-fox-sports-3063e4c4f90187f936214c8981c345d1","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:14:56+00:00","title":"Former NFL QB Mark Sanchez Faces Felony Charges Over Parking Dispute in Indianapolis","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports analyst Mark Sanchez is facing felony battery charges and three misdemeanors following a confrontation over a parking dispute at the Westin Hotel in Indianapolis on October 4.

attacking and seriously injuring a truck driver outside a hotel in what prosecutors say was a dispute over a parking place. The pretrial conference lasted only about 2 1/2 minutes. Sanchez, who was more seriously hurt in the confrontation, was not required to be present and did not enter a plea. “Thank you for allowing our client to be excused from today’s hearing. He’s still recovering from the injuries he sustained,” defense attorney Tim DeLaney told the judge, who also set another hearing for Nov. 20 and confirmed the next pretrial conference date for Dec. 2. Most of those dates were set earlier, but they’re all subject to change. DeLaney said Sanchez’s recovery process is ongoing and may impact the schedule. Prosecutors expressed doubt afterward that Dec. 11 is a realistic trial date. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Defense attorneys left without taking questions from reporters.

He said Sanchez entered his truck without permission, then physically blocked and shoved Tole, who then hit Sanchez with pepper spray. When Sanchez advanced despite being sprayed, Tole told police, he pulled a knife to defend himself. Security video shows Sanchez throwing Tole toward a wall on the hotel and to the ground, before running off, the affidavit says. Police found him at a restaurant on the same block. “We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and — or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears told reporters Oct. 6. Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the New York Jets and also played for Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.

persistently leveled unproven cheating allegations at  Daniel Naroditsky  in the year leading up to the American grandmaster’s death. The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced  his death  Monday. He was 29. The cause of death has not been made public. Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online  chess  last October.

The issue is just the lingering effect of it,” Naroditsky said, adding that Kramnik used to be one of his “heroes.” It’s not the first time Kramnik has been accused of harassment. The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik’s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless allegations about “many dozens of players.” The following year, Kramnik published a list of players on social media with the title “Cheating Tuesdays” that included Czech grandmaster David Navara. Navara later shared on his blog that Kramnik’s public accusations had pushed him to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation. In June, the federation responded to the players’ public spat, saying the way Kramnik presents his arguments “brings a lot of harm to the chess community,” and “could be ruinous for the careers and well-being of certain players.” The group invited Kramnik to present the details of his approach and statistical data for official evaluation. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Kramnik’s anti-cheating crusade exploded with the game’s shift online during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many elite players traded the physical chess board for a keyboard to continue playing through lockdown, creating a surge in popularity for streaming content and fast-paced online games in which Naroditsky excelled.  Players of the cerebral sport are known to value respectful conduct over the board. But in the digital arena, a new level of toxicity has developed, with cheating allegations growing rampant and becoming much more difficult to prove. Players now have sophisticated computer schemes at their fingertips that could give them an unfair advantage, and new ways to profit off their success online. In blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches, experts say top talents often move with speed and precision on par with a computer. Naroditsky was among the world’s top 25 blitz players and won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich acknowledged Wednesday. “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.” Dvorkovich said the federation will establish a prize in Naroditsky’s memory.  Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause. Kramnik wrote on the social platform X that the death “should be investigated by police.” He wrote Wednesday that he received threats after revealing “public information about the ‘dark side’ of modern chess.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/openai-atlas-web-browser-chatgpt-google-ai-f59edaa239aebe26fc5a4a27291d717a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:03:35+00:00","title":"OpenAI Launches Atlas Browser to Compete with Google in AI-Driven Search","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI launched its Atlas browser on October 21, 2025, marking a bold move into the competitive browser market to challenge Google Chrome, which dominates the web with 3 billion users.

Chrome’s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat. But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market. Microsoft ended up abandoning Explorer and introducing its Edge browser, which operates similarly to Chrome and holds a distant third place in market share behind Apple’s Safari. Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup. Altman said he expects a chatbot interface to replace a traditional browser’s URL bar as the center of how he hopes people will use the internet in the future. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Tabs were great, but we haven’t seen a lot of browser innovation since then,” he said on a video presentation aired Tuesday. A premium feature of the ChatGPT Atlas browser is an “agent mode” that accesses the laptop and effectively clicks around the internet on the person’s behalf, armed with a users’ browser history and what they are seeking to learn and explaining its process as it searches. “It’s using the internet for you,” Altman said. Harrington, the Forrester analyst, says another way of thinking about that is it’s “taking personality away from you.” “Your profile will be personally attuned to you based on all the information sucked up about you. OK, scary,” Harrington said. “But is it really you, really what you’re thinking, or what that engine decides it’s going to do? ... And will it add in preferred solutions based on ads?”  About 60% of Americans  overall — and 74% of those under 30 — use AI to find information at least some of the time, making online searches one of the most popular uses of AI technology, according to findings from an  Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research  poll taken over the summer. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Google since last year has automatically  provided AI-generated responses  that attempt to answer a person’s search query, appearing at the top of results. Reliance on AI chatbots to summarize information they collect online has raised a number of concerns, including the technology’s propensity to confidently spout false information, a problem known as hallucination. The way that chatbots trained on online content spout new writings has been particularly troubling to the news industry, leading The New York Times and other outlets to sue OpenAI for copyright infringement and others, including The Associated Press, to sign licensing deals. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A study of four top AI assistants including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini released Wednesday showed nearly half their responses were flawed and fell short of the standards of “high-quality” journalism. The research from the European Broadcasting Union, a group of public broadcasters in 56 countries, compiled the results of more than 3,000 responses to news-related questions to help ascertain quality responses and identify problems to fix. —— Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed to this story."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-media-rules-new-press-corps-b14b8cef6ba63cdac17c8ffac375e615","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"21:50:21+00:00","title":"Conservative Media Enters Pentagon Press Corps Amid Backlash from Mainstream Outlets","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new Pentagon press corps has been formed, consisting of conservative media outlets such as the Gateway Pundit, National Pulse, Human Events, Tim Pool, Just the News, Frontlines by Turning Point USA, and LindellTV, all of whom have agreed to a policy requiring news coverage to be approved by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

2025-10-22T21:50:21+00:00\n\nSeveral conservative news outlets said Wednesday they had agreed to a new press policy  rejected by virtually all legacy media organizations  and will take their place in the Pentagon to cover Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the U.S. military. The new Pentagon press corps will include the Gateway Pundit, the National Pulse, Human Events, podcaster Tim Pool, the Just the News website founded by journalist John Solomon, Frontlines by Turning Point USA and LindellTV, run by “MyPillow” CEO Mike Lindell. The Pentagon’s announcement came less than a week after dozens of reporters from outlets like The New York Times, The Associated Press, CNN and the Washington Post turned in their access badges rather than agree to a policy the journalists say will restrict them to covering news approved by Hegseth. Hegseth’s spokesman, Sean Parnell, announced the “next generation” of the Pentagon press corps with more than 60 journalists who had agreed to the new policy. He said 26 journalists who had previously been part of the press corps were among the signees. The department wouldn’t say who any of them were, but several outlets reposted his message on X saying they had signed on. There isn’t even unanimity among organizations that appeal to conservative consumers. Fox News Channel, by far the most popular news source for fans of President Donald Trump, was  among the walkouts , as was Newsmax. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Accusations of ‘self-righteous media’ In a post on X,  Parnell denounced  the “self-righteous media who chose to self-deport from the Pentagon.” “Americans have largely abandoned digesting their news through the lens of activists who masquerade as journalists in the mainstream media,” Parnell wrote. “We look forward to beginning a fresh relationship with members of the new Pentagon press corps.” The journalists who left the Pentagon  haven’t stopped working  covering the U.S. military. Many have been reporting aggressively, for example, on stories about  strikes against boats  in central America alleged to be part of the drug trade. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n By not being in the Pentagon, “reporters will have to work harder, there’s no question about it,” said Barbara Starr, a longtime Pentagon reporter retired from CNN. “But the real price is paid by the American people and the American military families,” Starr said. “Military families who have their sons and daughters serving, they want to know everything and they want to know it fast.” Starr wondered about Hegseth: “What is he so afraid of?” New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote a biting piece about the defense secretary over the weekend titled  “Fraidy-Cat at the Pentagon.”  But Hegseth’s boss, President Trump, has expressed support for the new media policy and Hegseth’s aggressive moves mirror some of those made by the administration. The president has sued outlets like  The New York Times  and  Wall Street Journal  for their coverage of him. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n New outlets must add staff Some of the outlets that accepted Hegseth’s rules will have to staff up for their new roles: Just the News, for example, posted an ad online seeking a Pentagon reporter. The Gateway Pundit’s White House correspondent, Jordan Conradson, posted on Wednesday that he was excited to join the Pentagon press corps “and help restore honest journalism after agreeing to follow basic rules ... something the legacy media refuses to do!” Lindell, whose My Pillow ads once blanketed Fox News before he joined the political media, posted a statement that LindellTV was “proud to be part of a new generation of news organizations reshaping how real information reaches the public.” Some of the publications pronounce themselves conservative in their mission statements.

San Francisco president of baseball operations Buster Posey made an unprecedented gamble on a coach with no previous experience in the pros. The 47-year-old Vitello will make the jump after spending his entire career in the college ranks. “Tony is one of the brightest, most innovative and most respected coaches in college baseball today,” Posey said. “Throughout our search, Tony’s leadership, competitiveness and commitment to developing players stood out.” Posey said the Giants look forward to the energy and direction Vitello brings, given that his passion for baseball aligns with the club’s values. “I’m incredibly honored and grateful for this opportunity,” Vitello said in the Giants’ announcement. “I’m excited to lead this group of players and represent the San Francisco Giants.

Posey had also considered his former backup catcher Nick Hundley, who has been working as a special assistant to Texas Rangers general manager Chris Young. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Instead, Posey is taking a route once tapped by the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys with Miami Hurricanes coach Jimmy Johnson in 1989. That worked out with Johnson winning two Super Bowl championships in 1992 and 1993 during a Hall of Fame career. Posey is striving for stability at manager after so much turnover for the franchise in recent years, including Posey taking over as president of baseball operations last fall when Farhan Zaidi was fired. The Giants dismissed manager Bob Melvin  after two years, and Posey quickly ruled out longtime Giants skipper Bruce Bochy as an option to replace him once Bochy parted ways with Texas following a three-year managerial stint. San Francisco finished 81-81 for one more victory than in Melvin’s first year. They haven’t reached the postseason since winning the NL West with a franchise-record 107 victories to edge the rival Dodgers by one game in 2021 under skipper Gabe Kapler. Longtime executive Harry Dalton thought the jump to MLB manager would be too big at once, so he hired Arizona State coach Bobby Winkles as a coach on the Angels’ staff for the 1972 season under Del Rice. Winkles then replaced Rice as manager in 1973. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Two Hall of Famers who managed in the big leagues were college coaches.

Casey Stengel coached the University of Mississippi in 1914 before being hired for his first big league managing job with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1934. In Vitello, the Giants will have a colorful and brash manager. The NCAA suspended Vitello twice during his Tennessee tenure, first for spending too much time arguing a call in 2018. During that two-game suspension, he raised money for charity with a  pizza and lemonade stand  while the Vols played. Chest-bumping an umpire  in 2022 led to a four-game suspension, and Vitello spent that time working with a  Tennessee fraternity  offering a  chest bump  to anyone donating $2 to the Wounded Warriors Project. Vitello is no stranger to Northern California. In 2002, he was associate head coach of the Salinas Packers in the California Collegiate League. The team went 50-14 and reached the National Baseball Congress World Series in Wichita, Kansas. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He played three seasons at Missouri as an infielder and began his coaching career there before stints with TCU and Arkansas, the latter as hitting coach.

Vitello then led the Vols to their first national title in baseball, winning the 2024 College World Series. Tennessee has reached the College World Series three times with Vitello. He has two SEC regular-season titles and a pair of SEC Tournament titles, the last in 2024.

People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain  immunotherapy drugs  lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. And it had nothing to do with virus infections. Instead,  the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA , appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida. The vaccine “acts like a siren to activate immune cells throughout the body,” said lead researcher Dr. Adam Grippin of MD Anderson. “We’re sensitizing immune-resistant tumors to immune therapy.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Health Secretary Robert F.

But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack.  Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak . It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the  Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines , scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.” Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer. Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too. So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t. Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said. —- The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP) — New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats. Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by U.S.  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators:  Republican Scott Brown , who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June. “Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again. I’m a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n National Republicans consider Sununu a strong candidate and one who allows them to go on the offensive as they look to hold their majority in the chamber next year. In statements, the Republican National Committee said Sununu’s entrance creates “a formidable Republican field poised to make this seat competitive in 2026.” The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, said they were “excited” about Sununu’s bid and that it “expands the Senate map and puts the Granite State in play for Republicans.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Senate Democrats, holding out for health care, reject government funding bill for 10th time \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump confirms the CIA is conducting covert operations inside Venezuela \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Senators struggle to find a way forward as government shutdown enters ninth day \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in  Ohio ,  Maine  and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates.

And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor’s office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire’s congressional seats since 2017. Sununu has been in contact with the White House about the Senate campaign, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to discuss private conversations. \n    \n     From AP’s Standards and Stylebook teams:   The AP is using anonymous sourcing to provide information for this story.

Sununu served three terms in the U.S. House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He was the chamber’s youngest member throughout his term, a fact he emphasized in a 2008 campaign ad that showed him sprinting up a steep mountain path. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “He’s younger, faster, quicker,” a deep-voiced (and somewhat redundant) narrator intones. “Inexhaustible.

Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but he said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security. Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests.” “Chris Pappas will stand up to corporate special interests and take on anyone to do what is best for New Hampshire, and that’s why Granite Staters will elect him to the U.S. Senate next November,” campaign manager Rachel Petri said in a statement. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Though Sununu has long been out of office, his name recognition remains high because of his family’s political prominence. His father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor and former White House chief of staff. One of his brothers,  Chris Sununu , served four terms as governor and flirted with a Senate campaign of his own in 2021. He also shot down a bid this cycle, saying he had spoken to the White House but opted against it. ___ Cappelletti reported from Washington."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/nobody-wants-this-netflix-judaism-f574958ba9d1b016c36496e7ee0181bf","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:05:40+00:00","title":"Netflix Series 'Nobody Wants This' Faces Criticism Over Jewish Representation Amid Season 2 Release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Netflix series 'Nobody Wants This' gained significant cultural traction with over 57 million views in three months, sparking both acclaim and controversy over its portrayal of Judaism and Jewish women.

ANGELES (AP) — When the first season of Netflix’s  “Nobody Wants This”  premiered last year, the series exploded in popularity in ways its creator and stars could never have imagined. It spent six weeks on Netflix’s Global English Top 10 TV List and was viewed 57 million times in three months, according to the streaming service. “I think we just kind of won the lottery with how ready people were for this kind of story,” said star and executive producer  Kristen Bell  ahead of Season 2’s release on Thursday. The romantic comedy follows the relationship between a hip but devout Reform rabbi, Noah  (Adam Brody),  and Joanne (Bell), an agnostic woman who hosts a podcast about dating and sex. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Kristen Bell and Adam Brody in “Nobody Wants This.” (Stefania Rosini/Netflix via AP) \n                 \n            \n         \n        \n     \n    \n     \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                 \n             \n         \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                         \n                            \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n                         \n                     \n                     \n                         \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             Kristen Bell and Adam Brody in “Nobody Wants This.” (Stefania Rosini/Netflix via AP) \n                                \n\n     \n         \n             \n             \n                Add AP News on Google  \n                 \n             \n                 \n        Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.\n                     \n         \n           \n             \n           \n         \n       \n             \n             \n\n             Share\n                \n                 \n                \n                 \n\n                 \n                    \n                 \n         \n\n         \n             \n                 \n                    Share\n                     \n                 \n\n                \n                 \n     \n        \n               \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Facebook \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Copy \n     Link copied \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Print\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Email\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     X \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     \n     LinkedIn \n \n \n        \n             \n\n \n     \n         \n     \n \n Bluesky \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     Flipboard \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     Pinterest \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Reddit \n \n        \n     \n \n\n                \n             \n         \n         \n     \n\n\n\n\n                             Read More \n                         \n                     \n                 \n             \n            \n         \n     \n    \n \n\n                 \n             \n         But with the internet’s collective swooning over Brody’s hot rabbi, there also came swift criticism and think pieces about how the show played into antisemitic tropes, especially in its depiction of Jewish women. Noah’s sister-in-law, Esther, and his mother, Bina, were often decried as bitter and controlling antitheses to Joanne and her sister, Morgan  (Justine Lupe). \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “When it first came out and I watched the first episode, I was so uncomfortable,” said Rabbi Elan Babchuck, the executive vice president of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership. “There’s a lot that I would want to change about it.” \n\n He took issue with a host of the show’s depictions of Judaism, which he thinks was often presented as a “test to pass rather than a tradition to pass on,” as well as the frequent use of the word “shiksa,” a derogatory term for non-Jewish women (that is noticeably absent from Season 2). Eventually though, Babchuck went back and watched the entire season. Although his critiques remained, he ultimately had a change of heart. “I celebrate the show. I think representation matters across the board, even when it’s in flawed form,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n On-screen and off-screen changes in Season 2 When “Nobody Wants This” was renewed for a second season last year, Netflix announced that  HBO’s “Girls”  alums Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan would be taking over as showrunners, while Erin Foster, the show’s creator who loosely based the story on her own life and conversion to Judaism, would stay on as an executive producer. “We love the show. It’s Erin’s voice. It’s Erin story,” Konner said. “Our job is literally to protect her voice and to show her stuff she may not know because she hasn’t done this job before.” \n     \n         \n                \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n\n    \n \n\n                 \n                \n                 \n                     “Nobody Wants This” creator Erin Foster, who loosely based the series on her own conversion to Judaism, discusses the hit show’s engagement with religion ahead of the second season dropping on Netflix.

The second season finds them dealing with the fallout of Noah being passed up for head rabbi at his temple because Joanne wasn’t ready to convert. \n    \n     Reporter and videojournalist  Krysta Fauria  did graduate studies in religion and once unearthed an ancient Roman coin at an archaeological dig. \n    \n \n But Season 2 also shows a different side of Bina and explores more of Esther’s story, something Foster maintains was always part of the plan. “If you are a Jewish woman who has felt like you didn’t like how you’re portrayed in the world or how people view you and this sort of reaffirmed that, I can understand the sensitivity. Definitely it was never the intention,” she said. “I think that the characters evolve in Season 2 in a way that they always naturally were going to.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Fielding criticism For the most part though, Foster and the rest of the cast are taking the critiques with a grain of salt. “Not everyone should be allowed to put their opinion publicly everywhere,” she said. “Obviously, one show or group of characters can’t stand in for a whole civilization,” Brody added. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Adam Brody, left, and Kristen Bell, cast members in the Netflix series “Nobody Wants This,” pose for a portrait in Los Angeles on Oct. 16, 2025.

Rabbi Nicole Guzik of Sinai Temple, a Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles where parts of “Nobody Wants This” were filmed, recalled Brody for both seasons asking her to go over his Hebrew pronunciations with him. “It was so sweet and so authentic that he cared very much about playing the role accurately,” she said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Finding faith in ‘Nobody Wants This’ Although “Nobody Wants This” explores Judaism as a religion and whether Joanne will ultimately embrace it, Foster maintains the religious elements are meant to be “more of a backdrop” for their love story than a focal point of the series. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “There is no intention for it to feel heavy-handed. I think that people really grabbed onto the right amounts of religion in the show,” she said. But for some, the show’s engagement with Judaism and conversion is what makes it unique and attractive. “To have a Netflix series be so popular and be around conversations of what it means to be Jewish in an uplifting way, in a curious way, I don’t see how we can be critical,” Guzik reflected. “I know that there are going to be different pieces of a Jewish narrative that I may not necessarily ascribe to or align with. But that’s also the Jewish story, right? We are widely diverse.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Adam Brody, left, and Kristen Bell, cast members in the Netflix series “Nobody Wants This,” pose for a portrait in Los Angeles on Oct. 16, 2025.

sought Wednesday to ease concerns in Israel that the Trump administration was dictating terms to its closest ally in the Middle East, as he and other top U.S. envoys visit Israel this week to support  the Gaza ceasefire agreement . “We don’t want in Israel a vassal state, and that’s not what Israel is. We want a partnership, we want an ally,” Vance said beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in response to a reporter’s question about whether Israel was becoming a “protectorate” of the U.S. Netanyahu — who will meet with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday — expressed similar sentiments while acknowledging differences of opinion as they push forward the U.S.-proposed ceasefire agreement. “One week they say that Israel controls the United States. A week later they say the United States controls Israel. This is hogwash. We have a partnership, an alliance of partners who share common values, common goals,” Netanyahu said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n One concern in Israel is that an international security force in Gaza — envisioned in the ceasefire’s second phase — could limit the Israeli military’s ability to take action in the Palestinian territory if it perceives a threat to its own security.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 EU leaders seek role in Gaza at summit focused on Ukraine and Russia \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Vance criticizes Israel’s parliament vote on West Bank annexation, says the move was an ‘insult’ \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the 13 hostages whose remains are still inside Gaza \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Vance acknowledged that the road to long-term peace is challenging, with the ceasefire less than two weeks old, but tried to maintain the buoyant tone he sounded Tuesday after arriving in Israel. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “We have a very, very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza to make life better for the people in Gaza, but also to ensure that Hamas is no longer a threat to our friends in Israel. That’s not easy,” Vance said. “There’s a lot of work to do, but I feel very optimistic about where we are.” Vance also met with relatives of Israeli hostages. He was accompanied by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n UN court rules on aid to Gaza The International Court of Justice said on Wednesday that  Israel must allow  the U.N. aid agency in Gaza, known as UNRWA, to provide humanitarian assistance to the territory. The Hague-based court was asked last year by  the U.N. General Assembly  to determine Israel’s legal obligations after the country  effectively banned  the agency, the main provider of aid to Gaza, from operating there. Israel “is under the obligation to agree to and facilitate relief schemes provided by the United Nations and its entities, including UNRWA,” ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa said. Israel has denied it has violated international law, saying the court’s proceedings are biased, and the country  didn’t attend hearings  in April. UNRWA has faced criticism from  Netanyahu  and his far-right allies, who claim the group is deeply infiltrated by Hamas. Questions about ceasefire plan’s next steps Uncertainty surrounds next steps in the ceasefire, including the territory’s postwar governance and the disarming of Hamas. Vance said Tuesday officials are brainstorming on the composition of the international security force, mentioning Turkey — with whom Israel has had tense relations in recent years — and Indonesia as countries expected to contribute troops. Vance was flanked by flags from a number of countries expected to participate, including Germany, Denmark and Jordan. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n An Israeli official said the issue of Turkish participation in the security force was discussed in the meeting between Vance and Netanyahu, and that Netanyahu expressed his opposition to Turkish troop presence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing closed diplomatic talks. Meanwhile, in an apparent effort to embarrass Netanyahu during Vance’s visit, far-right politicians in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday took the symbolic step of giving preliminary approval to a bill that would give Israel authority to annex the occupied West Bank – a move that the U.S. opposes. The bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether the bill has support to win a majority in the 120-seat parliament, and Netanyahu has tools to delay or defeat it. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Returns of remains on both sides Israel said Wednesday it completed the identification of the remains of two more hostages that were handed over on Tuesday. Arie Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar were killed in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas militants which triggered the war. Since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, the remains of 15 hostages have been returned to Israel.  Another 13 need to be recovered in Gaza  and handed over, a key element of the ceasefire agreement. In Gaza, the Health Ministry said Wednesday that Israel returned the bodies of 30 Palestinians. That brings the number of bodies of Palestinians returned to Gaza to 195, of whom 57 have been identified by families, according to the ministry, which operates under the Hamas-run government. Dozens of people gathered outside Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis on Wednesday for funeral prayers over the bodies of 54 Palestinians returned since the ceasefire began. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A senior health official in Gaza has said some of the bodies bore “evidence of torture” and called for an investigation. Israel has not provided identification for the bodies or explained their origins. They could include Palestinians who died during the Oct. 7 attack, detainees who died in custody or bodies taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war. Israelis bid farewell to Thai hostage killed in 2023 Thousands of people in Israel on Wednesday attended the funeral of Tal Haimi, who was killed during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that started the war, and whose remains had been returned from Gaza a day earlier, according to a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Israelis were also set to bid farewell to a Thai farmworker whose body will be repatriated. Sonthaya Oakkharasri was killed during the Oct. 7 attack. His remains were returned last weekend. Hamas-led militants in that attack killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. ___ This story was first published on Oct. 22, 2025. It was updated on Oct. 22, 2025 to correct that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office did not issue a statement that said: “We are not a protectorate of the United States.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Justice Department appealed the first order and — in a 2-1 ruling Monday — a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Law enforcement officers are seen outside a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland, Ore., Monday, Oct. 20, 2025.

She has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the administration’s request to dissolve that order. Meanwhile, the state is asking the 9th Circuit to reconsider Monday’s ruling. California legal battle goes before appellate panel A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena heard arguments Wednesday related to Trump’s deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles. A district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in June after protests over Trump’s immigration crackdown. Judge Charles Breyer handed California Gov. Gavin Newsom a victory on June 13 when he ordered control of California’s Guard members back to the state. But in an emergency ruling, an  appeals court  panel sided with the Trump administration, putting Breyer’s decision on hold and allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds. The appeals court is now weighing whether to vacate Breyer’s June order. The same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration’s appeal of Breyer’s Sept. 2 ruling, which found the president violated  the Posse Comitatus Act , an 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws.

They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” — but only with state lawmakers’ blessing. Since their  arrival on Oct. 10 , troops have been patrolling downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Guard members have no arrest power, officials have said. ___ Johnson reported from Seattle. Associated Press writers Mark Sherman in Washington, D.C., Olga R.

The House Agriculture Committee Democrats said on X that this shows that Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins “could have supported farmers all along, but you chose not to because you’d rather use farmers’ pain to score cheap political points while increasing the cost of living for ordinary Americans by making food and health care more expensive.” Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig, who is the ranking Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, said the administration should have done this sooner to ensure that farmers can get the help they need. “I am glad the administration is finally doing right by America’s farmers by partially opening FSA offices, though I question why the administration waited so long and made this decision only after putting farmers through three weeks of uncertainty,” Craig said. ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed to this story from Washington."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/merkley-floor-speech-shutdown-trump-democrats-c75e71aaabd642c547179f7174a009fd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:29:16+00:00","title":"Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley Leads 22-Hour Senate Speech to Protest Government Shutdown and Trump’s Policies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark 22-hour Senate floor speech from October 22, 2025, Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley led a protest against President Donald Trump’s administration, highlighting the government shutdown and accusing Republicans of using it to cut health care and promote authoritarianism. The speech, one of the longest in Senate history, was framed as a moral and political alarm bell, with Merkley calling authoritarianism 'here right now.' While Democrats have voted 12 times to keep the government shut down, Republicans refuse to negotiate over expiring health care subsidies. The speech drew criticism from Republican Senator John Barrasso, who called it 'rubbish,' and forced unpaid Senate staff to work overnight.

Jeff Merkley, Democrats seized the Senate floor on Wednesday to protest President Donald Trump’s presidency amid the  government shutdown  and push for Republicans to negotiate with them on expiring health subsidies.  Merkley spoke for more than 22 hours — from 6:21 p.m. Tuesday to 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday — pausing for lengthy questions from other Democratic senators. His speech was one of the longest in Senate history, just short of a similar speech in April by Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.  Booker, who was also protesting Trump,  broke the record  for longest continuous Senate speech by going for more than 25 hours, surpassing a 1957 speech by Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Thurmond was  filibustering the advance  of the Civil Rights Act.  The senator’s talk-a-thon came as Democrats have forced the government shutdown over their demands to extend government health care subsidies, and as Republicans have refused to negotiate over the expiring tax credits until Democrats vote to reopen the government.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Democrats have voted 12 times to keep it closed — most recently Wednesday evening — and the two sides have made little progress toward a resolution.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Appellate judges question moves to keep Alina Habba in place as top New Jersey prosecutor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 GOP’s immigration pitch to New Jersey Latinos aims for some distance from Trump in governor’s race \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the life and legacy of chimpanzee researcher and wildlife advocate Jane Goodall \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Merkley said on the Senate floor that Republicans were the ones shutting down the government “to continue the strategy of slashing Americans’ health care” after passing cuts to Medicaid and other programs over the summer.  \n    \n     Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government.

Like Booker, Merkley’s speech was not a filibuster, which is meant to halt or delay the advance of a specific piece of legislation.  By holding the floor open overnight, Merkley forced Senate floor staff, security and other support workers who are currently unpaid to work overtime hours. The government has been shut down since Oct. 1.  “The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff — who they refuse to pay — work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,” Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, posted on X Tuesday night. “How ridiculous is that?” Immediately after Merkley’s speech, Barrasso mocked the Democratic senator and called his speech “rubbish.”  Merkley appeared tired for much of the day, saying in the early afternoon that he was “starting to feel a little dazed” and later that “my stamina is getting a little shaky.” But he kept going until early evening.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He said afterward that he was able to keep going, without a bathroom break or any food, because of “dehydration” and not eating beforehand.  At around 2:45 a.m., only a few hours in, Merkley paused to untie his shoelace. He said standing in one place had “made my shoes a little tight.”  “I don’t recommend standing through the night and talking,” said Merkley, who turns 69 on Friday. “Not a healthy pursuit. But I am standing here to ring the alarm bells.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-canal-street-protest-arrests-85f88f0820533f584c895fca650d4f42","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:41:45+00:00","title":"Immigration Agents Conducting Sweep on NYC’s Canal Street Confronted by Protesters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal immigration sweep on Manhattan’s Canal Street on October 21, 2025, resulted in the arrest of 14 people, including immigrants and demonstrators, under a claim of targeting counterfeit goods.

Agents quizzed her about how she had come to the U.S., but they eventually backed off after her husband explained that she’s an American citizen, she said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa clash bitterly during final NYC mayoral debate \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Immigration agents conducting sweep on NYC’s famed Canal Street confronted by protesters \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Many swings, few knockout hits as Cuomo and Mamdani trade jabs in heated first NYC mayoral debate \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “They asked every African that was here for their status,” Ngam said. \n    \n     ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n She returned to the spot Wednesday unafraid but upset. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “I’m saddened because they should not walk around and ask people for their passport in America,” said Ngam, who said she came to the U.S. from Mauritania in 2009.

Separately, state Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, asked New Yorkers to send in photos or videos of Tuesday’s immigration sweep so that her office can assess whether any laws were broken. Law enforcement raids aimed at combating counterfeiting are relatively frequent on Canal Street, which is known for its stalls and shops where some vendors hawk knock-off designer goods and bootlegged wares. Federal authorities often team up with the New York Police Department and luxury brands on crackdowns aimed at shutting down illicit trade.  But the sight of dozens of masked ICE and other federal agents making arrests drew instant protests. Bystanders and activists converged at the scene and shouted at the agents, at one point blocking their vehicle. ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agents tried to clear the streets, sometimes shoving protesters to the ground and threatening them with stun guns or pepper spray before detaining them. Nine people were arrested in the initial immigration sweep, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Four more people were arrested on charges of assaulting federal law enforcement officers, she said, adding that a fifth was arrested and accused of obstructing law enforcement by blocking a driveway. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n McLaughlin said some of the people arrested had previously been accused of crimes, including robbery, domestic violence, assaulting law enforcement, counterfeiting and drug offenses.  The sweep came after at least two conservative influencers shared video on X of men selling bags on Canal Street’s sidewalks. While clashes between immigration authorities and protesters have  played out in Los Angeles and other cities , such scenes have been rarer on New York City streets, which Mayor Eric Adams has attributed in part to his working relationship with President Donald Trump’s administration. Adams, a Democrat, said city police had no involvement in Tuesday’s immigration sweep. “Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-treasury-debt-ceiling-bessent-09575f13ca95c2f1beb38234b2cbe85b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"21:23:48+00:00","title":"U.S. National Debt Surpasses $38 Trillion Amid Government Shutdown, Experts Warn of Inflation and Economic Risks","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion, a record that underscores rapid fiscal growth during a federal government shutdown.

It’s also the fastest accumulation of a trillion dollars in debt outside of the COVID-19 pandemic — the  U.S. hit $37 trillion in gross  national debt in August this year.  The $38 trillion update is found in the  latest Treasury Department report , which logs the nation’s daily finances. Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model, who served in President George W. Bush’s Treasury Department, told The Associated Press that a growing debt load over time leads ultimately to higher inflation, eroding Americans’ purchasing power.  The  Government Accountability Office  outlines some of the impacts of rising government debt on Americans — including higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages and cars, lower wages from businesses having less money available to invest, and more expensive goods and services. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I think a lot of people want to know that their kids and grandkids are going to be in good, decent shape in the future — that they will be able to afford a house,” Smetters said. “That additional inflation compounds” and erodes consumers’ purchasing power, he said, making it less possible for future generations to achieve home ownership goals.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants in a push on Putin to end Ukraine war \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump vows to reach a ‘fantastic deal’ with China after future meeting with Xi \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 US and Australia sign critical-minerals agreement as a way to counter China \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The Trump administration says its policies are helping to slow government spending and will shrink the nation’s massive deficit. A new analysis by Treasury Department officials states that from April to September, the cumulative deficit totaled $468 billion. In a post on X Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that’s the lowest reading since 2019. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “During his first eight months in office, President Trump has reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period in 2024 by cutting spending and boosting revenue,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement, adding that the administration would pursue robust economic growth, lower inflation, tariff revenue, lower borrowing costs and cuts to waste, fraud and abuse.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Joint Economic Committee  estimates  that the total national debt has grown by $69,713.82 per second for the past year. Michael Peterson, chair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said in a statement that “reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties.” “Along with increasing debt, you get higher interest costs, which are now the fastest growing part of the budget,” Peterson added. “We spent $4 trillion on interest over the last decade, but will spend $14 trillion in the next ten years. Interest costs crowd out important public and private investments in our future, harming the economy for every American.” The U.S. hit $34 trillion in debt in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2310-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a diverse range of global events, including Ukraine's confidence in its long-term war strategy despite territorial losses, Israel's military positioning beyond the yellow line, a chess controversy involving Vladimir Kramnik and Daniel Naroditsky, a potential major hurricane forming from a storm, the arrest of trafficker Zhi Dong Zhang in Cuba after escaping Mexico, security vulnerabilities exposed by a museum heist in France, the U.S. per capita national debt at $111,000, border clashes between Afghanistan and Pakistan, U.S. sanctions on Russia over inaction in Ukraine, and diplomatic tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro.

government over investigations he faced that  he claims were politically motivated . Now, the Justice Department that Trump has exerted control over could approve a hefty payout in taxpayer dollars.  The Republican president’s comments in the Oval Office on Tuesday have put a spotlight on a law through which people can seek damages if they believe they were wronged by the federal government.  But the potential that the president might take taxpayer money from the same government he leads has raised numerous ethical questions, especially since Trump has made cutting federal spending a top administration priority.  Adding to conflict-of-interest concerns is the fact that top Justice Department officials who would presumably have to sign off on such a settlement previously served as a defense lawyer for the president or his close allies. Here’s a look at Trump’s claims and the process that could play out:  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump says he’d have final say on money he seeks over past federal investigations into his conduct \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 House Republicans preparing report on Biden’s use of autopen after months of investigation \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Appellate judges question moves to keep Alina Habba in place as top New Jersey prosecutor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n How the claims process works  Before reclaiming the White House, Trump filed two claims with the Justice Department seeking $230 million in damages related to the FBI’s 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property for classified documents and for a separate investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign, The New York Times reported Tuesday.  He filed the claims in 2023 and 2024 under a law that permits individuals to sue federal agencies, like the Justice Department, if they believe they’ve been harmed by employees of those agencies acting within the scope of their duties. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, individuals must first file an administrative claim with the government agency. The agency then has six months to either settle the claim or deny it outright.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n If the agency denies the claim or doesn’t act on it within that time frame, the person can then file a federal lawsuit. Trump has not yet filed a lawsuit on either claim, even though six months have passed.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The usual source of payments for claims against the government is from what’s known as the Judgment Fund. Treasury Department records show payments from the Judgment Fund over the last year on behalf of a slew of federal agencies related to discrimination claims, violations of the Privacy Act and other matters.  In one recent high-profile case, the Justice Department  in 2024 agreed to pay more than $138 million  to settle 139 administrative claims brought by people who accused the FBI of grossly mishandling allegations of sexual assault against Larry Nassar in 2015 and 2016. Why Trump says the government owes him money  Trump has long claimed he was the victim of a weaponized Justice Department that targeted him for political purposes. The Biden administration’s Justice Department abandoned both criminal cases it brought against Trump after his White House victory last November because of department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. The president signaled his interest in compensation during a White House appearance last week with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi — telling reporters “I’m suing myself” — even though his claims to date have not been filed as lawsuits. He said he believes the government owes him a “lot of money,” but suggested he could donate any taxpayer money or use it to help pay for a ballroom he’s building at the White House. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n One of the administrative claims, filed in August 2024 and reviewed by The Associated Press, seeks $115 million in compensatory and punitive damages over the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate and the resulting case alleging he hoarded classified documents and thwarted government efforts to retrieve them. It accuses former Attorney General Merrick Garland, former FBI Director Christopher Wray and Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith of harassing and targeting Trump with a “malicious prosecution” in an effort to hurt Trump’s bid to reclaim the White House.  The Times said the other claim seeks damages related to the long-concluded Trump-Russia investigation, which continues to infuriate the president. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Defense lawyers for Trump and his allies could have the final say  Trump’s claims have raised thorny ethical issues because under Justice Department policy, proposed settlements of more than $4 million must be approved by the deputy attorney general or associate attorney general. Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was one of Trump’s lead defense lawyers in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. And Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward represented Trump’s  valet and co-defendant, Walt Nauta,  in the same case. The department has not said whether Blanche and Woodward would be recused in settlement talks, but said in a statement on Tuesday that “in any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.” Bondi, in July, however, fired the department’s top official responsible for advising the attorney general and deputy attorney general on ethics issues.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Democrats plan to investigate Democrats pounced on the news, announcing that Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, would launch an investigation into what they called a “shakedown” that violated the Constitution. It was not immediately clear what shape that inquiry might take, but it seems unlikely that Raskin or other Democrats will get any cooperation from Justice Department leadership, particularly in the aftermath of a combative congressional appearance that Bondi made earlier this month."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/five-dead-two-missing-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-soaks-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:40:23+00:00","title":"Five dead, two missing as Tropical Storm Fengshen soaks Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Fengshen caused deadly flooding and landslides across the Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and two missing persons.

province in the north of the country, five members of one family, including two children, were crushed to death when a tree fell on their bamboo house early on Sunday, according to Philippine disaster agency officials in the town of Pitogo, where the incident took place.\n\nImages posted on social media by officials showed the house destroyed under the weight of a large palm tree, as a rescue team worked to remove the bodies of the family.\n\nAccording to a statement shared on social media, a teenage boy was the lone survivor of the accident in Pitogo, about 153km (95 miles) southeast of the capital Manila.\n\nMore than a dozen flights were ordered cancelled by aviation authorities as Fengshen hovered over Luzon, situated just south of Manila, as of Sunday afternoon. The storm was reported to be moving west towards the South China Sea.\n\nThe AFP news agency quoted officials in southeastern Luzon as saying at least 47,000 people had left their homes for the safety of government-designated temporary shelters since Saturday. At least five dams on Luzon island opened their gates to release water on Sunday, according to the national weather agency, Pagasa.\n\nIn the central Philippines, heavy flooding was reported by officials on the islands of Samar and Panay, forcing residents to evacuate.\n\nOne person was injured in the town of Estancia on Panay Island after he was pinned down following the collapse of his wooden house, the ABS-CBN news website reported.\n\nRumagasa ang baha sa ilang barangay sa Calbayog City, Samar dahil sa hagupit ng bagyong  #RamilPH  sa lugar ngayong Linggo, October 19. | via Ranulfo Docdocan\n\n(Courtesy: Reymark Espinosa)  pic.twitter.com/dJAV5eOdZo\n\n— ABS-CBN News (@ABSCBNNews)  October 19, 2025\n\nTranslation: Raging floodwater inundated several areas of Calbayog City in Samar due to Tropical Storm Ramil [Fengshen] as of Sunday, October 19.\n\nIn the province of Bukidnon on the southern island of Mindanao, two people were reported missing after their motorised three-wheel vehicle fell off a highway following a large landslide triggered by the heavy rains.\n\nPublic works officials said the highway, which connects Bukidnon to the neighbouring Davao region, is now blocked to traffic.\n\nOn average, the Philippines is hit by about 20 storms and typhoons each year, and scientists warn that extreme weather events are becoming more powerful as the planet warms due to human-driven climate change.\n\nFengshen also comes as the Philippines started to recover from  a series of major earthquakes  that killed at least 87 people over the past three weeks.\n\nIn a Facebook post published on Sunday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said the country needs to “strengthen its disaster preparedness and response” as it is “very prone to having disasters and calamities”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/why-has-dutch-government-taken-control-of-china-owned-chipmaker-nexperia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"13:37:55+00:00","title":"Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch government has taken effective control of the semiconductor company Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology, under the Goods Availability Act due to concerns over serious managerial shortcomings and risks to the continuity of critical technological capabilities in Europe.

taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"14:52:29Z","title":"Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, with President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth minerals.

trade measures against China\n\nChina has accused the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has announced new and expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added metals such as holmium and ytterbium, and restricted access to refining equipment.

metals: Why this matters\n\nChina tightened export controls for critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/graveyards-are-now-last-option-shelters-in-gaza-for-palestinians-amid-ruins","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:32:38+00:00","title":"Graveyards are now last option shelters in Gaza for Palestinians amid ruins","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been forced to use graveyards as temporary shelters due to the destruction of homes, lack of safe housing, and prohibitive costs of renting land.

after Israel destroyed their residences across  Gaza  are pitching tents in graveyards as a last resort, as the humanitarian catastrophe in the enclave remains acute despite a fragile  ceasefire deal .\n\n“This graveyard wasn’t meant for the living,” Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said, reporting from the southern city of Khan Younis. “But today, it’s home to dozens of families who have nowhere else

out of desperation,” she added.\n\nRami Musleh, a father of 12 who was displaced from the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoon, could not find any viable option other than the graveyard.\n\n“For parents, the emotional toll is heavy. The psychological trauma of war is made worse by having to raise children among tombstones,” Musleh told Al Jazeera.\n\nAnother resident, Sabah Muhammed, said the cemeteries have now lost all their sacredness.\n\n“Graveyards, once sacred spaces for the dead, are now silent witnesses to a living crisis. No water, no electricity, and no privacy … only the bare minimum to survive,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In Gaza, even the land for the dead is now the only refuge for the living.”\n\nAccording to the United Nations, at least 1.9 million people – or about 90 percent of the population – across the Gaza Strip have been displaced during the war. Many have been displaced repeatedly, some 10 times or more.\n\nPalestinians in southern Gaza are squeezed into overcrowded shelters as Israel issued forced orders for residents of northern Gaza and Gaza City to  evacuate  and then bombarded many as they fled south.\n\nThe price of renting even a square metre of land to pitch a tent is prohibitive for many displaced Palestinians, who lack a stable income and are dependent on scarce humanitarian assistance.\n\nUNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinians, said 61 million tonnes of debris now cover Gaza and entire neighbourhoods have been erased. It said families were searching the ruins for shelter and water.\n\nWhile a fragile ceasefire has been in effect since October 10, Israel is continuing to heavily restrict humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Chinese national, whom authorities in the United States accuse of trafficking large quantities of fentanyl and cocaine into the country before being arrested and then escaping custody in Mexico, has been recaptured in Cuba, according to Mexican officials.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexico’s Security Cabinet said in a statement that the alleged trafficker, who had escaped Mexican authorities in July, was arrested in Cuba, but did not identify him by name. A federal official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the case, confirmed to The Associated Press news agency that the suspect was Zhi Dong Zhang, also known as “Brother Wang”.\n\nHe was indicted in federal court in Atlanta in 2022 on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Mexican authorities captured him in Mexico City in October 2024 at the request of the US government. But a judge granted him house arrest, and last July, he escaped the home he was being held in under military guard.\n\nAfter escaping in Mexico, Zhang had travelled to Cuba and then to Russia, where he was detained for illegal entry and returned to Cuba, according to another Mexican federal agent, who also requested anonymity to discuss the case. The agent said Zhang could be deported to Mexico.\n\nCuban authorities did not respond to a request from the AP for comment about Zhang on Wednesday.\n\nZhang’s escape in July came at a sensitive moment for the administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who was trying to hold off crushing tariffs threatened by the Trump administration, which accused Mexico of not doing enough to stop fentanyl smuggling into the US.\n\nGovernment documents filed in the Atlanta case describe a drug trafficking network led by Zhang that imported cocaine and fentanyl into the US and then distributed it through hubs in the Atlanta and Los Angeles areas. Zhang reportedly called the drugs “coffee” and “food”, respectively, in coded language, the court documents said.\n\nMillions of dollars from the drug sales were allegedly collected at stash houses in Georgia and California and deposited into accounts that Zhang could access from Mexico, the documents said.\n\nZhang’s recapture comes as the Trump administration escalates its regional attacks on what it says are vessels smuggling drugs.\n\nThe US carried out a ninth military strike on a vessel allegedly carrying illicit drugs across international waters, killing three people. For the second time, the boat in question was not in the Caribbean Sea but instead in the Pacific Ocean. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the strike on Wednesday.\n\nThe latest strike opens a new front in President Donald Trump’s growing military campaign against Latin American cartels, raising questions about the limits and legality of his actions.\n\nIn the meantime, engaging in a new round of verbal sparring, Trump has called Colombian President Gustavo Petro a “thug” who is  “making a lot of drugs” , and the leader of the South American country has threatened legal action against Trump in US courts.\n\nWeeks of escalating tension between Washington and Bogota hit a new level on Wednesday when  Trump told reporters at the White House  he was suspending all military aid to Colombia due to its alleged role in the international narcotics trade and warned Petro to “watch it”.\n\nResponding to the US president’s threat, Petro took to social media to announce he would take legal action against Trump’s slanderous remarks.\n\n“From the slanders that have been cast against me in the territory of the United States by high-ranking officials, I will defend myself judicially with American lawyers in the American justice system,” Petro wrote on X."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, marking a major advancement in its space programme.

the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/un-pushes-for-worldwide-disaster-alerts-as-extreme-weather-spirals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:35:15+00:00","title":"UN pushes for worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has issued a global call to action urging nations to strengthen early-warning systems for extreme weather events, which have increased due to climate change.

worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’\n\nNearly half of all countries lack early-warning systems for extreme weather events, leaving millions – especially those in developing nations – vulnerable.\n\nAs it released a new report on Monday, the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged. Timely alerts are crucial to saving lives as extreme weather events multiply due to climate change, it warned.\n\n“Many millions of people lack protection against dangerous weather, which is inflicting an increasing toll on economic assets and vital infrastructure,” said a statement by the WMO, noting that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early-warning systems.\n\nThe organisation said weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people in the past 50 years. It added that 90 percent of those deaths occurred in developing countries.\n\n“Impacts are spiralling as weather becomes more extreme,” it said.\n\nThe WMO acknowledged that there has been “huge progress” in climate monitoring over the last decade. The number of countries using some form of multi-hazard early warning systems has jumped from 52 to at least 108.\n\nHowever, it continued, an assessment of 62 countries showed half of them possess only basic capacity and 16 percent have less than basic capacity.\n\n“The situation is worst in fragile, conflict and violence-affected contexts,” the organisation said.\n\nNevertheless, the WMO is seeing progress in Africa, with more countries having functioning websites and issuing standardised alerts.\n\n“Early warning means early action. Our goal is to not only warn the world; it is to empower it,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a speech as the UN institution opened its annual conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\nThe world has been rocked by numerous weather-related disasters in 2025. Huge  flooding has rocked countries including Pakistan ,  Nigeria  and  South Korea . Wildfires have devastated large areas in  southern Europe , as well as  the US .\n\nThe head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told delegates at the conference that no country or region was spared from the effects of climate change and extreme weather.\n\nShe pointed to the example of how the regular monitoring of a mountain glacier allowed scientists to warn about its imminent collapse in May 2025, allowing for the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten.\n\n“Permafrost melt will inevitably lead to more glacier collapses and rockfalls,” making early warning systems vital, she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm in the Caribbean this year and the 13th of the Atlantic hurricane season, is moving slowly toward the Caribbean Sea, bringing heavy rainfall to Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Aruba, and Puerto Rico.

Russian assets to help Ukraine in war\n\nEuropean Union leaders are meeting in Brussels to discuss further backing for Ukraine, including the use of Russian  frozen assets  to provide a 140-billion-euro ($163.27bn) loan to the war-torn country, drawing fury from Moscow.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa welcomed Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Thursday’s summit as a “future member” of the bloc, announcing that a “political decision” would be made on the plan to use cash balances from frozen Russian central bank securities to cover Kyiv’s funding needs in 2026 and 2027.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said he saw “broad support” for the measure. His Finnish counterpart, Petteri Orpo, said he hoped the European Commission would come up with a concrete proposal soon, so assets would be available next year.\n\nBut Belgium, home to the Euroclear securities depository that holds the biggest tranche of frozen assets – worth some $225bn – expressed doubts over its legality.\n\n“I have not even seen the legal basis for the decision yet,” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters upon his arrival at the summit. He said his country would “stop the decision” if Belgium’s demands were not met.\n\n“I share the Belgian prime minister’s concerns but am confident we will take a step forward,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters.\n\nEU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said the bloc was ready to work on a mechanism to ensure Belgium received the legal guarantees it was seeking. The risks on Russian assets needed to be shared, she said.\n\nReporting from Brussels, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said countries were “on the verge” of making an announcement, but alluded to wrangling over whether Kyiv should use the loan to buy European or US arms.\n\n“The Germans, the French, and the Italians were saying: ‘If we release that money, it has to go to European manufacturers of weapons to be used to benefit Europe as well,’” he said.\n\nA senior official in Zelenskyy’s administration told news agency Reuters that Ukraine needed the funds by the end of the year and autonomy over how to spend them.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova vowed a “painful response” from Moscow. She warned that any seizure of Russia’s assets would be illegal, describing their confiscation as “theft”.\n\nSpeaking at the summit, Zelenskyy thanked the United States and the EU for agreeing on new energy sanctions against Russia, saying they were “very important”.\n\nHe received a boost on Wednesday when US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia for the first time since returning to the White House, targeting Russian oil giants  Lukoil and Rosneft .\n\nOn Thursday, Zelenskyy was bolstered further by the EU’s greenlighting of a 19th package of EU  sanctions  against Russia that will hit Russia’s revenue streams through “new energy, financial, and trade measures”, according to the Danish rotating presidency.\n\n“It targets Russian banks, crypto exchanges, entities in India and China, among others,” EU’s Kallas said in a post on X.\n\nThe sanctions will see the EU blacklist more tankers in Russia’s “shadow fleet”, used to get around oil export restrictions, and impose new rules on Moscow’s diplomats to curb their travel around Europe.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the package’s ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports was an important step towards a complete phasing out of Russian energy in the EU.\n\nSlovakia, which continues to import energy from Russia, had been the final obstacle to the deal. Populist Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has close ties to Moscow, had sought assurances on high energy prices and protections for Slovakia’s car industry.\n\nSpeaking at a Russian Foreign Ministry briefing, Zakharova slammed the US measures on Thursday, describing them as counterproductive. Addressing the EU sanctions, she said EU “elites” had to accept their measures were not working.\n\n“Russian goals in Ukraine remain unchanged, and the root causes of the conflict need to be resolved,” she told reporters.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Trump had aligned himself with “loony” Europe, describing the sanctions as an act of war.\n\nReporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said the EU and US measures would be “very painful” for Russia and would “definitely hurt the economy”.\n\n“The Kremlin has said that Russia has developed a certain immunity to them, and continues to function, but those who are familiar with the whole situation say that the new sanctions will make the continuation of Russian oil supplies to countries like India, for instance, impossible,” she said.\n\nThe US Treasury has given companies until November 21 to wind down their transactions with the Russian oil producers. Indian oil industry sources told Reuters that refiners were poised to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil following the US sanctions.\n\n“There will be a massive cut. We don’t anticipate it will go to zero immediately as there will be some barrels coming into the market” before the deadline, a refinery source said.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he would raise concerns about China’s purchases of Russian oil during his sit-down with President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea next week.\n\nThe Brussels summit takes place after Trump said his plan for a  meeting  with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, which had caused consternation among Kyiv’s European allies, was on hold because he did not want it to be a “waste of time”.\n\nFollowing  tense talks  between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House last week, in which the former told the latter he would have to make territorial concessions to Russia, European leaders had been eager to show that Ukraine could still count on their support.\n\nBut they are also on high alert after a series of Russian air incursions and mysterious drone flights in European airspace and are likely to sign off on a new “road map” to prepare Europe to defend itself against a Russian attack by the end of the decade.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukraine’s strongest European backers, who form part of the “coalition of the willing”, said they opposed any push to make Ukraine surrender land captured by Russian forces in return for peace.\n\nThe United Kingdom will host a meeting of the members of that coalition of more than 30 countries on Friday, with Zelenskyy also expected to be in attendance.\n\nZelenskyy told reporters in Brussels that a ceasefire was possible in Russia’s war on Ukraine but that yet more pressure would be needed on Moscow to make it happen.\n\nHe ruled out making any territorial concessions to Russia."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/map-of-gaza-shows-where-israeli-forces-are-positioned-under-ceasefire-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:36:40+00:00","title":"Map of Gaza shows where Israeli forces are positioned under ceasefire deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Satellite imagery analysis by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency reveals that Israeli forces maintain around 40 active military positions in Gaza outside the yellow line, despite a ceasefire agreement.

Israeli army holds about 40 active military positions in the part of the Gaza Strip outside the yellow line, the invisible boundary established under the first phase of the ceasefire to which its troops had to move, according to the deal.\n\nThe images also show that Israel is upgrading several of these facilities, which help it maintain its occupation of 58 percent of Gaza even after the pullback by troops to the yellow line.\n\nWhile the majority of sites are concentrated in southern Gaza, every governorate hosts at least one military position. Some sites are built on bases established during the war, while others are newly constructed. The total number of sites in each governorate is:\n\nOne of the most prominent military points in Gaza City is located on top of al-Muntar Hill in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City. A comparison of images between September 21 and October 14 shows the base being paved and asphalted.\n\nSince the ceasefire took effect about two weeks ago, nearly 100 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across the Strip, with some attacks occurring near the yellow line.\n\nOn October 18, Israeli forces  killed  11 members of the Abu Shaaban family in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence. Seven children and three women were among those killed when the Israeli military fired on the vehicle as the family attempted to return home to inspect it.\n\nThe Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a “suspicious vehicle” that had crossed the so-called yellow line. With no physical markers for the line, however, many Palestinians cannot determine the location of this invisible boundary. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has since said the army will install visual signs to indicate the line’s location.\n\nIn the first ceasefire phase, Israel retains control of more than half of the Gaza Strip, with areas beyond the yellow line still under its military presence. This has blocked residents of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoon, the neighbourhoods of Shujayea, Tuffah, Zeitoun, most of Khan Younis, and all of Rafah City from returning home.\n\nAccording to the 20-point plan announced by United States President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29 – developed without any Palestinian input – Israel is to withdraw its forces in three phases, as shown on an accompanying crude map, with each phase marked in a different colour:\n\nEven after the third withdrawal phase, Palestinians will be confined to an area which is smaller than before the war, continuing a pattern of Israel’s control over Gaza and its people.\n\nMany questions remain about how the plan will be implemented, the exact boundaries of Palestinian territory, the timing and scope of Israeli withdrawals, the role of the ISF, and the long-term implications for Palestinians across Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe plan is also silent on whether Israel gets to continue its aerial and sea blockade of Gaza, which has been in place for the past 18 years."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/mexico-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-64-with-dozens-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"21:47:55+00:00","title":"Mexico flooding death toll rises to 64, with dozens still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond caused severe flooding and landslides in five Mexican states, resulting in at least 64 deaths and over 65 people still missing.

2025-10-23T03:22:11+00:00\n\nTitle: US, Colombia tensions surge as Presidents Trump, Petro trade threats\n\nDonald Trump and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro have engaged in a new round of verbal sparring, with the United States president calling his South American counterpart a “thug” who is  “making a lot of drugs” , and the Colombian leader threatening legal action against Trump in US courts.\n\nWeeks of escalating tension between Washington and Bogota hit a new level on Wednesday when Trump told reporters at the White House he was suspending all military aid to Colombia due to its alleged role in the international narcotics trade and warned Petro to “watch it”.\n\n“He’s a thug and he’s a bad guy, and he’s hurt his country very badly,” Trump said.\n\n“They’re doing very poorly, Colombia. They make cocaine. They have cocaine factories … and he better watch it or we’ll take very serious action against him and his country,” the US president said.\n\n“What he has led his country into is a death trap,” Trump added.\n\nResponding to the US president’s threat, Petro took to social media to announce he would take legal action against Trump’s slanderous remarks.\n\n“From the slanders that have been cast against me in the territory of the United States by high-ranking officials, I will defend myself judicially with American lawyers in the American justice system,” Petro wrote on X.\n\n“I will always stand against genocides and murders by those in power in the Caribbean,” he said, adding that when Colombian “help is required to fight against drug trafficking, American society will have it”.\n\n“We will fight against the drug traffickers with the states that want our help,” Petro added.\n\nLast weekend,  Trump labelled Petro a “drug trafficking leader”  and threatened to increase tariffs on Colombian exports.\n\nPetro responded by accusing the US president of violating international trade agreements and acting like a “king” in Latin America. He also  recalled Colombia’s ambassador to Washington  and said Colombian troops would not support a potential US military intervention in neighbouring Venezuela, where Trump has also labelled the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro, a drug trafficker.\n\n“What Colombian would help invade where their own family lives, only to see them killed like in Gaza?” Petro said.\n\nColombia’s ambassador to the US, Daniel Garcia Pena, speaking to the AFP news agency in Bogota where he has been recalled, said Trump’s latest remarks were “unacceptable”.\n\n“Under no circumstances can one justify that kind of threats and accusations that have no basis whatsoever,” Pena said, warning that the 200-year alliance between Colombia and the US was being put at risk.\n\nThe growing war of words between Trump and Petro follows the US administration’s announcement in September that it would decertify Colombia’s counter-narcotics efforts, claiming the country failed to meet its obligations to fight drug trafficking.\n\nIt also comes amid increasing threats by Trump against Venezuela’s President Maduro and  a US military build-up in the Caribbean , including attacks on vessels which the US claims are involved in drug smuggling, without providing any evidence.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed earlier on Wednesday that US forces had, for the first time in the regional build-up, conducted a strike on a vessel travelling in international waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing two people.\n\nHegseth alleged the victims were “narco-terrorists”, without providing any evidence. He later announced an attack on yet another speedboat and the killing of three more people in international waters in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe  attacks were the latest by the US military  against alleged drug traffickers on the high seas – involving eight boats and one semi-submersible – with 37 people killed so far, according to US figures.\n\nThe origin of the vessels attacked by the US has not been disclosed, though some were destroyed off Venezuela’s coast, while at least one came from Trinidad and Tobago, and another from Colombia, families of the deceased told AFP.\n\nInternational law experts say the Trump administration’s summary killings of people in international waters are illegal. Even if those killed are confirmed to be drug traffickers, they still have the right to due legal process.\n\nWhile Colombia is the world’s top cocaine producer, successive governments in Bogota have long worked alongside the US to curb production, which is controlled by a range of well-funded cartels and armed paramilitary groups and rebels.\n\nIn a later post on social media on Wednesday, Petro said 17,000 cocaine factories in Colombia had been destroyed during his time in government.\n\nLe informó al mundo que llevo 17.000 fábricas de cocaína destruidas en mi gobierno  https://t.co/0KQclu7mC6\n\n— Gustavo Petro (@petrogustavo)  October 23, 2025\n\nTranslation: I informed the world that I have destroyed 17,000 cocaine factories during my government."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/23/live-un-urges-israel-to-allow-medical-evacuation-from-gaza-amid-ceasefire?update=4054943","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:00:43+00:00","title":"UN urges Israel to allow 15,000 people in Gaza to receive treatment abroad","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations is urging Israel to allow 15,000 people in Gaza to receive medical treatment abroad, citing the dire health conditions and ongoing blockade.

returning to the White House, citing a lack of progress in ceasefire talks to end Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The same day, European Union leaders approved their 19th Russian sanctions package.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the sanctions would target Russia’s two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, due to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “refusal to end this senseless war” in Ukraine and Moscow’s “lack of serious commitment” to the peace process.\n\n“Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy,” Bessent said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n“We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions,” he said.\n\nThe measures taken by the Department of the Treasury, which also sanctioned dozens of Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, block the US assets of the designated firms, while preventing Americans from doing business with them. Notably absent from the US sanctions were  Chinese and Indian buyers  of Russian oil.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he would raise concerns about China’s purchases of Russian oil during his sit-down with President Xi Jinping at the 2025 APEC summit in South Korea next week.\n\nThe US Treasury Department also said it was prepared to take further action if Russia continues to wage its more-than-three-year war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has yet to issue a public response to the US measures.\n\nKremlin-controlled Rosneft is Russia’s second-largest company in terms of revenue – behind only gas giant Gazprom – but it has been hit hard in recent years by sanctions and falling oil prices. In September, it reported a 68 percent year-on-year decline in net income for the first half of 2025.\n\nLukoil, Russia’s third-largest firm and its largest non-state enterprise, also posted a 26.5 percent fall in profits for 2024, citing increased taxation as Moscow funds its war effort in Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the United Kingdom announced its own sanctions against both firms, saying that there was “no place for Russia in global markets” and Britain would take all steps to stop Moscow from funding its war in Ukraine.\n\nNow is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire. Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary…  https://t.co/tbJTyf8x2V\n\n— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent)  October 22, 2025\n\nThe sanctions come as Trump’s patience with President Putin appears to be wearing thin, with ceasefire talks continuing to make little progress.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday after announcing he had postponed his planned meeting with  Putin in Hungary , Trump said the timing of the meeting felt off.\n\n“We cancelled the meeting with President Putin – it just didn’t feel right to me,” Trump said. “It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I cancelled it, but we’ll do it in the future,” he said.\n\nThe US leader said he hoped the sanctions would not need to be in place for long, but expressed growing frustration with stalled truce negotiations.\n\n“Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere. They just don’t go anywhere,” he said.\n\nWashington’s sanctions were announced on the same day as the EU said it had also approved its 19th package of sanctions against Moscow over its war against Ukraine, including an EU ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.\n\n“We are very pleased to announce that we have just been notified by the remaining member state that it’s now able to lift its reservation on the 19th sanctions package,” the Danish rotating presidency of the EU said in a statement.\n\nSlovakia had been holding out after the EU agreed on the final text last week. Prime Minister Robert Fico was seeking assurances from the European Commission on high energy prices and aligning climate targets with the needs of carmakers and heavy industry.\n\nNew clauses meeting Slovakia’s demands were added to the final communique on the new package of sanctions in advance of the EU leaders’ summit in Brussels on Thursday, a Slovak diplomat told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe new package will see short-term LNG contracts with Russia end after six months, and long-term contracts end from January 1, 2027.\n\nThe sanctions also add new travel restrictions on Russian diplomats and list 117 more vessels from  Moscow’s shadow fleet  of clandestine sanctions-evading vessels, bringing the total to 558, as well as banks in Kazakhstan and Belarus.\n\nAndriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, celebrated the package but said “we are not stopping”.\n\n“Package no. 20 is already in the works,” he wrote on Telegram.\n\n“The logic is simple – less money in Russia means fewer missiles in Ukraine,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/23/live-un-urges-israel-to-allow-medical-evacuation-from-gaza-amid-ceasefire?update=4054944","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:00:43+00:00","title":"UN urges Israel to allow 15,000 people in Gaza to receive treatment abroad","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations, including its World Health Organization, has urged Israel to allow 15,000 people in Gaza to receive medical treatment abroad due to a severe healthcare crisis.

probes former champion Kramnik over US grandmaster's death\n\nChess’s governing body has said it is considering disciplinary action against Russian former world champion Vladimir Kramnik over unproven cheating allegations he repeatedly levelled against fellow player Daniel Naroditsky in the  year leading up to the latter’s death .\n\nInternational Chess Federation (FIDE) president, Arkady Dvorkovich, said on Wednesday that the game’s governing body was investigating public statements and social media posts made by Kramnik accusing Naroditsky, a 29-year-old American grandmaster, of cheating.\n\nDvorkovich said he had referred all relevant posts by Kramnik to the body’s Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for review, adding that the federation would take “appropriate action” in cases of public harassment or bullying.\n\nOn Monday, Naroditsky’s chess club, the Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, released a statement announcing his sudden death. A chess prodigy, Naroditsky’s passing has shocked the game’s followers and players. No cause of death has been made public.\n\nCalifornia-born Naroditsky became a grandmaster — the highest title in chess aside from world chess champion — at the age of 18. The son of Soviet immigrants to the US, Naroditsky was consistently ranked in the world top 200 for traditional chess and the top 25 for blitz chess, a high-speed version. In August, he won the US National Blitz Championship.\n\nNaroditsky had once said that Kramnik used to be one of his “heroes”.\n\nBut last October, Kramnik, who held the chess world crown for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing Dvorkovich of cheating in online chess.\n\nThe Russian grandmaster has reiterated those accusations in several social media posts over the past year. He has not provided substantial evidence for his claims.\n\nNaroditsky accused Kramnik of trying to ruin his life, admitting during a 2024 Twitch stream that the “constant online negativity” was causing him to suffer from bouts of burnout and anxiety.\n\nDuring his final livestream on Saturday, Naroditsky told his massive online following that, “ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it”.\n\npic.twitter.com/oIXCHsx3fC\n\n— Vladimir Kramnik (@VBkramnik)  October 18, 2025\n\nThere are no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky. According to the chess governing body’s anti-cheating laws, it may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data.\n\nIn the days following Naroditsky’s death, Kramnik has taken to X to defend himself against suggestions he is culpable, saying in one post that “all those falsely blaming me will be legally responsible”.\n\nIn another post, he posted an image with the caption “don’t do drugs”, while also referencing a “strange recent stream” by Naroditsky.\n\nMany of the biggest names in contemporary chess have come out to condemn Kramnik’s pursuit of Naroditsky.\n\nFive-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen called his harassment campaign “appalling”, while Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin condemned the “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations”.\n\n“This has to stop. When respected figures spread unfounded allegations without accountability, real lives are destroyed,” Sarin wrote on X.\n\nNaroditsky was not the first player Kramnik has accused of cheating.\n\nThe former world champion’s anti-cheating allegations erupted first during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many elite players went online to continue playing through lockdown. In the digital arena, hard-to-prove cheating allegations have grown rampant.\n\nIn 2023, Kramnik’s blog on popular internet chess server Chess.com was shut down, with administrators accusing him of spreading baseless allegations about “many dozens of players”.\n\nCzech grandmaster David Navara, who also faced accusations of cheating from Kramnik, said he had been pushed to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/23/live-un-urges-israel-to-allow-medical-evacuation-from-gaza-amid-ceasefire","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:00:43+00:00","title":"UN urges Israel to allow 15,000 people in Gaza to receive treatment abroad","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations is urging Israel to allow 15,000 people in Gaza to receive medical treatment abroad, citing ongoing critical health emergencies and a blocked Rafah border.

to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to

European Union is preparing to adopt a new round of sweeping sanctions against Russian energy exports on Thursday, a day after United States President Donald Trump imposed similar measures against Moscow amid setbacks to his efforts at diplomacy with Vladimir Putin.\n\nThese steps come as Russia and Ukraine are increasingly targeting each other’s energy infrastructure in an attempt to make it economically harder to wage war.\n\nOn the ground, Russia’s war in Ukraine remained stagnant.\n\nRussia claimed it had taken another handful of villages during the past week – Tykhe and Pishchane in Kharkiv, Novopavlivka, Chunyshyne and Pleshcheyevka in Donetsk, Poltavka in Zaporizhia and Privillia in Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nOn the whole, however, Ukrainian front lines remained resilient and Russia scored no major breakthrough.\n\n“I think that their army is weak now,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a visit to the White House on Friday. “They have a lot of losses in economy and people.”\n\nHe urged Trump to use that weakness to force Russia to the negotiating table, saying he was prepared to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin one-on-one.\n\nJust before that meeting, Trump had spoken to Putin and had seemingly pulled back on previous suggestions that the US might supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles. After the call, Trump said that he hoped the US would not need to share those missiles with Kyiv.\n\n“We need Tomahawks … you’re talking about massive numbers of very powerful weapons … Hopefully, we’ll be able to get the war over with without thinking about Tomahawks.”\n\nTrump also announced that he would be meeting with Putin in Budapest over the next two weeks.\n\nBut that attempt at direct diplomacy with his Russian counterpart fell through this week, when the US president said he wouldn’t be meeting Putin any more, suggesting that it would be a waste of time.\n\n“Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump said on Wednesday at the White House, with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte seated next to him.\n\nRussia had, a day earlier, rejected Trump’s latest proposal for a ceasefire along existing lines of control in Ukraine – a pitch that Kyiv and major European powers backed.\n\nIndeed, despite losing slivers of territory, Ukraine feels it has certain advantages – particularly in long-range warfare against the Russian rear.\n\nSince late summer, Ukraine has stepped up a targeted campaign to take out Russian refineries, depriving Moscow of gasoline for its economy and diesel for its war machine.\n\nUkraine had successfully struck Russian energy infrastructure 58 times since August, compared with three times in June and July, according to a Reuters analysis. Ukraine is believed to have destroyed or damaged about a fifth of Russia’s refining ability.\n\nJust in the past week, Ukraine has struck several facilities.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia’s gas processing complex at Orenburg, 1,200km southeast of Moscow, was forced to shut down its gas intake from Kazakhstan after being struck by Ukrainian drones. The strike caused a massive explosion and fire at the plant.\n\nThe Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery in Russia’s Volga region also stopped processing crude oil after being struck on the same day.\n\nRussian energy facilities were struck in its Bryansk region and neighbouring Smolensk on Tuesday, said Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation. “Our forces also took out the Bryansk chemical plant,” he said.\n\nOther strikes were thwarted. Russia said it downed at least 88 Ukrainian long-range drones over its border regions during the week.\n\nBut the cumulative effect of Ukraine’s attacks has been felt. Petrol prices in Russia have risen, and rationing has been introduced in some regions.\n\nSatellite images captured on October 17 showed that Ukrainian drones had severely damaged at least 11 main storage tanks at the Feodosia oil terminal in Crimea, used by Russia to supply its forces in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s General Staff believed at least 16 tanks to be damaged, and Frontelligence Insight, an open-source analyst, put the number at 19.\n\nThrough the attacks, Ukraine has also successfully struck at Russia’s ability to sell its oil for export revenue.\n\nIn an address to Ukrainians on October 15, Zelenskyy called Ukraine’s long-range capabilities “the things that truly affect Russia’s war potential and noticeably reduce it”.\n\n“There has been an increase both in the range and in the accuracy of our long-range [capabilities] against Russia,” Zelenskyy said on Sunday.\n\nAt the White House on Friday, Zelenskyy sought to convince Trump — unsuccessfully for the moment — to allow Ukraine access to the Tomahawk cruise missiles, with a 2,500km (1,550-mile) range.\n\nCurrently, Ukraine’s most powerful missile is the Anglo-French Storm Shadow, with a range of about 500km.\n\nUkraine produces drones that have struck Russian refineries 2,000km away, and wants missiles to match that range to create combined strikes, Zelenskyy said at the White House.\n\nHe offered Ukrainian drone technology and production know-how in exchange for the Tomahawks.\n\nBut Russia has said it would regard the transfer of Tomahawks to Ukraine as an escalation. A top Russian diplomat told reporters on Friday that it would “elevate the risks in the security sphere – not only European, but global security as well”.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has mirrored Ukraine’s tactics, targeting its electricity production, according to an analysis by Ukrainian Pravda. The newspaper found that during July and August, Russia had targeted Ukraine’s power stations in the east of the country, forcing massive transfers of electricity from power stations in the west. It had switched to targeting substations and power lines during July and August, to cause a blackout in the east.\n\nRussia has also not spared coal, which Ukraine uses to generate electricity. Ukrainian coal miner DTEK said Russian drones had struck one of its mines in Dnipropetrovsk, in the country’s southeast, and had struck three more of its mines in the past two months.\n\nRussia’s long-range capabilities are greater than Ukraine’s. Between October 16 and 22, Russia launched 859 drones and 77 missiles into the beleaguered country. Ukraine intercepted three-quarters of the drones but fewer than half the missiles, many of which were ballistic.\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly called for more air defence systems from his allies. Despite initial reports of an acrimonious meeting with Trump on Friday, Zelenskyy described the meeting as “positive” and said Ukraine was preparing to buy 25 Patriot air defence systems.\n\nTrump and the EU have until recently taken opposite approaches to peace, with Trump believing in a deal between superpowers and European leaders siding with Zelenskyy in calling for more pressure on Putin.\n\nThat appeared to change this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump imposed sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, with the threat of risks to foreign financial institutions that do business with these firms — a warning that could make it harder for countries like India to continue to buy oil from Moscow.\n\nEarlier in the week, Trump called for an immediate halt to the war and for current battlefield control lines to serve as the starting point for subsequent negotiations.\n\nUkraine and Europe quickly accepted Trump’s proposal.\n\n“We strongly support President Trump’s position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” said the leaders of Europe’s five biggest economies and leading Ukraine allies in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, however, said that an immediate ceasefire along existing contact lines was not acceptable to Moscow.\n\nTo Europe, this apparent dissonance between Trump and Putin offers an opportunity to further batter  Russia’s flagging war economy .\n\n“We must ramp up the pressure on Russia’s economy and its defence industry, until Putin is ready to make peace,” said the European leaders in their statement.\n\nThe EU’s upcoming 19th package of sanctions will take important steps in curtailing the oil and gas that Europe currently imports from Russia.\n\nThe Council of EU energy ministers said the bloc would phase out all Russian gas during the course of next year.\n\nThe EU never banned Russian gas as it banned Russian oil imports, and last year imported 51.7bn cubic metres of it. Greenpeace recently discovered that France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands bought 34.3 billion euros ($40bn) of Russian LNG last year, but among them gave 21.2 billion euros ($24.5bn) in various forms of support to Ukraine.\n\nThe EU’s new sanctions are also expected to use 140 billion euros ($162bn) in cash reserves belonging to Russia’s central bank but immobilised on EU soil as collateral for a loan of equal size to Ukraine. A draft of this measure, seen by Reuters, would set aside most of the money for Ukrainian purchases of European weapons, with some going to US weapons like the Patriot systems.\n\nThe EU would thus use Russian money to develop Ukraine’s defences and rebuild the European defence industry, despite Moscow railing against such a move for months.\n\nIt was perhaps this that Zelenskyy was referring to when he told Ukrainians his meeting with European leaders was leading to “a strong and, in many ways, completely new agreement on our defence capabilities”.\n\nThe cash injection is timely. Military aid to Ukraine fell by 43 percent in July and August compared with the first half of the year, according to the Kiel Institute.\n\nLastly, the EU’s newest package would target third parties buying Russian oil.\n\nAccording to reports, sanctions will involve two Chinese refineries, a Chinese trading company and a fourth Chinese entity involved in circumventing existing sanctions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2310-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a diverse range of global developments, including Pakistan's rollout of an HPV vaccine to combat cervical cancer, geopolitical tensions involving Russia and Lithuania’s military readiness, U.S.-China semiconductor trade restrictions, the spread of misinformation via social media influencers, a new U.S. transparency law, a Nobel Prize awarded to chemist Omar M.

drones for third day after airport reopens\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have targeted Sudan’s capital Khartoum and its main airport with drones, a day after the first passenger flight in two years landed in the city amid the civil war.\n\nThe government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) intercepted the drones on Thursday, which caused no damage, a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press news agency. The RSF and SAF did not immediately acknowledge the attack.\n\nWitnesses told the AFP news agency that they heard two drones over Khartoum at about 4am (02:00 GMT), before explosions went off.\n\nThe airport has come under repeated drone attacks blamed on the RSF since Tuesday. Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said “both sides seem to be stepping up the use of drones, with the RSF using them here in the capital, Khartoum, to target facilities such as the airport”.\n\nLast week, drones targeted two army bases in northwest Khartoum, although a military official said most of the aircraft were intercepted.\n\nCivil war broke out in Sudan in 2023, when SAF and the RSF, once allies, turned on each other, leading to widespread fighting and devastation across the country.\n\nThe Sudanese military retook the capital from the paramilitary force in March, but it needed months to repair Khartoum International Airport before the local Badr Airlines landed a plane there on Wednesday.\n\nThe airport’s reopening has been postponed “under further notice”, an airport official told AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced about 12 million more and left 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country, making it the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration and other United Nations agencies have called for an “immediate cessation of hostilities and protection of civilians, especially children, and unhindered humanitarian access to all affected populations.”\n\nOne of the hardest hit areas is  el-Fasher , the provincial capital of North Darfur province, which has been under siege for more than a year. The UN and other aid groups warn that 260,000 civilians remain trapped in the city.\n\n“What I witnessed in Darfur and elsewhere this week is a stark reminder of what is at stake: children facing hunger, disease and the collapse of essential services,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF’s deputy executive director, in a statement.\n\n“Entire communities are surviving in conditions that defy dignity,” Chaiban added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/climate-study-finds-overheating-world-will-add-57-superhot-days-a-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"07:27:09+00:00","title":"Climate study finds overheating world will add 57 superhot days a year","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that climate change has already led to an additional 11 superhot days annually since 2015, and by 2100, the world will face 57 such days per year due to warming at 2.6°C, a marked improvement from the pre-Paris 4°C scenario that would have added 114 days.

Climate study finds overheating world will add 57 superhot days a year\n\nA new study by World Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew4kqg09j8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:37:56.747+00:00","title":"Why Beyond Meat shares have surged 1,000% in four days","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Beyond Meat's stock has surged over 1,000% in just four days, fueled by a combination of a Walmart distribution deal, a short squeeze triggered by Roundhill Investments' inclusion in a meme stock ETF, and online investor enthusiasm on platforms like Reddit.

days\n\nAppetite for Beyond Meat's plant-based burgers is shaky but traders definitely seem to have developed a taste for its stock.\n\nShares in the company have soared more than 1,000% over four days - a stunning rally for a company that had seen its share price all but wiped out since it debuted on the stock exchange six years ago.\n\nThe business has been struggling with sluggish sales - and has not posted a quarterly profit in more than five years - as shoppers turn away from its meat alternatives.\n\nThe surge has reignited debate whether the activity, propelled in part by online enthusiasm among everyday investors, is a sign of an overly frothy stock market.\n\nBeyond Meat shares rose by as much as 112% on Wednesday, extending gains from the previous three trading sessions and briefly boosting its share price above $7.\n\nBut the rally faded after a volatile day of trading, and the stock ended down roughly 1%, to close at roughly $3.60.\n\nMomentum started to build last week, when a Reddit user helped fuel a wave of purchases, drawing comparisons to other rallies of so-called meme stocks such as  GameStop  and  AMC .\n\nThe gains continued after Roundhill Investments on Monday added the company to the bucket of companies owned by its meme stock ETF, or exchange-traded fund. The move appeared to spark a so-called short squeeze: as the stock price surged, the many investors betting against the company were forced to buy shares to cover their losses.\n\nThe company also announced a distribution deal with Walmart on Tuesday, further boosting its shares.\n\n\"This company was essentially being thought of as going out of business not that long ago,\" said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide.\n\n\"Getting a positive catalyst like the Walmart deal, which could be transformational with the rebound of demand and getting products in the hands of consumers - that is absolutely the trigger,\" he added, referring to the stock surge since last Friday.\n\nBut Mr Hackett cautioned that the Walmart deal to expand distribution \"doesn't necessarily fix all the issues\".\n\n\"You're really trading on emotions and technicals, versus fundamentals,\" Mr Hackett said.\n\nThe company remains on shaky ground. Its share price remains well below its all-time high of more than $230 in 2019.\n\nThe Beyond Meat meme stock surge comes against a  backdrop of jitters  about an overvalued stock market.\n\nAt the forefront are concerns about a possible bubble emerging in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Those worries have intensified as analysts struggle to see how the vast sums of money the biggest players are throwing at one another all fit together.\n\nJP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon  echoed the concerns  this month. He told the BBC he was \"far more worried than others\" about a serious market correction, which he said could come in the next six months to two years.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also noted possible market manipulation tied to meme stocks, warning of the risks to everyday investors.\n\nSome have responded with calls for tighter rules around short selling and social media-fuelled trading.

2025-10-15T13:18:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/louvre-director-recognises-jewel-theft-failures-says-she-offered-to-resign","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:28:34+00:00","title":"Louvre director recognises jewel theft failures, says she offered to resign","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre museum in Paris experienced a major daylight heist on Sunday, October 20, when four men broke into the Galerie d’Apollon using a truck with an extendable ladder and a bollard setup to disguise their actions.

theft failures, says she offered to resign\n\nThe Louvre’s director has said a “terrible failure” in security at the iconic Paris museum resulted in last weekend’s daylight crown jewel heist, adding that she offered her resignation to France’s culture minister, but it was refused.\n\nAttempting to explain to the French Senate on Wednesday how thieves made off with an estimated 88 million euros ($102m) in jewels, Laurence des Cars acknowledged that staff “did not detect the arrival of the thieves soon enough”.\n\n“Today we are experiencing a terrible failure at the Louvre, which I take my share of responsibility in,” she told the senators, adding that she submitted her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati. She added that Dati, however, turned down the resignation offer.\n\nDes Cars said Sunday’s heist exposed the museum’s shortage of security cameras outside the monument, as well as other “weaknesses”.\n\nShe said while the Louvre’s alarms were working properly during the heist, some of the museum’s cameras are “ageing”, while the one nearest the thieves’ entry point was “directed westward and therefore did not cover the balcony involved in the break-in”.\n\nDes Cars said she would push for a police station to be placed inside the museum, while she also suggested that barriers be erected to prevent vehicles from parking directly alongside the buildings.\n\nThe Louvre – which welcomes 30,000 visitors a day –  reopened  on Wednesday, with tourists queueing up to enter the world’s largest and most-visited museum for the first time since the audacious daytime heist which stunned the world.\n\nFour men used a truck with an extendable ladder to access a balcony window, entering the Galerie d’Apollon (Apollo’s Gallery) through a window shortly after the museum opened at 9.30am on Sunday.\n\nThe thieves erected bollards on the street to make it look as though they were carrying out maintenance work, des Cars explained.\n\nIn total, the thieves spent less than four minutes inside the Louvre before making off with eight pieces dating back to the Napoleonic era. They made their getaway on motorbikes through central Paris. Three days on, the jewels remain missing and the thieves at large.\n\nAmong the haul was an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon Bonaparte gave his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise. Also stolen was a diadem that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, which is dotted with nearly 2,000 diamonds.\n\nThe thieves also dropped Eugenie’s emerald-set imperial crown – encrusted with more than 1,300 diamonds – as they fled. It was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron denounced the heist as an “attack on a heritage that we cherish”.\n\nNone of the stolen items was privately insured, and the Louvre will not be compensated if they are not found. Insuring such priceless works would cost billions annually.\n\nStaff at the Louvre have repeatedly highlighted concerns around understaffing and overcrowding, with very few eyes on too many rooms, resulting in a staff walkout in protest in June.\n\nIn January, Macron announced a substantial renovation plan for the Louvre, which will include security upgrades, after des Cars complained of its derelict state."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched a national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, aiming to combat cervical cancer — a leading cause of death for women in the country.

Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c709w5v9dq9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:11:02.439+00:00","title":"What's at stake as Trump-Petro feud strains the US-Colombia alliance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US-Colombia alliance, once a cornerstone of regional security and drug control, is now under severe strain due to deep political and diplomatic clashes between President Gustavo Petro of Colombia and Donald Trump of the United States.

Trump-Petro feud strains the US-Colombia alliance\n\nFor decades it was one of Washington's closest alliances.\n\nUnited in their fight against drug trafficking, Colombia and the United States co-operated closely, with the latter receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in US military assistance annually.\n\nBut now that alliance appears be more fragile than ever.\n\nThe leaders of the two countries may have a similar style - forceful and not prone to mincing their words - but left-wing Gustavo Petro and Donald Trump come from opposing ends of the political spectrum and have clashed frequently since Trump returned to the White House in January.\n\nOn Sunday, tensions reached their highest point when Trump accused Petro of encouraging drug production in Colombia and announced the suspension of payments and subsidies to the South American country.\n\nThis came after Petro had in turn accused US officials of murdering a Colombian citizen and violating his country's sovereignty in one of the multiple strikes that the US military has carried out against alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean since early September.\n\nBBC Mundo spoke to experts who warned that with the alliance in jeopardy, both Colombia and the US could be at risk of losing out while organised crime groups look set to benefit.\n\nColombia became one of the main beneficiaries of US aid in the early 2000s, with the money going towards \"Plan Colombia\" - a US-funded initiative to combat drug trafficking groups, reduce the flow of drugs to the US, and strengthen the Colombian security forces.\n\nThis investment is credited with weakening the Farc guerrilla group, which was at war with the state before officially demobilising in 2016.\n\nSince then, US assistance has been reduced - and has come under questioning.\n\nDespite Colombia's military successes against armed groups, and its recent years of relative stability and security, some analysts doubt whether Plan Colombia truly resolved the drug problem in the long term.\n\nCocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to  researcher Héctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe level of cultivation of coca, the key ingredient in cocaine, is also at record highs, although the Colombian government maintains that the rate of crop expansion has been slowing since 2021.\n\nThe US military campaign in the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking paradoxically demonstrates that drugs have not been eradicated in the region and remain a priority for Washington.\n\nThe strengthening of the security forces under Plan Colombia also had collateral effects.\n\nParamilitary groups became involved in abuses against civilians, and some demobilised members of these groups later joined the drug-trafficking business.\n\nSimilarly, the high number of military personnel in the early 2000s produced a large pool of young, retired soldiers, some of whom have been accused of signing up as mercenaries to fight in foreign conflicts.\n\nDespite the reduction in funding in previous years, US aid to Colombia still exceeded $400m (£300m) in 2024, according to estimates by the US-based research organisation Washington Office on Latin America (Wola).\n\nElizabeth Dickinson, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told BBC Mundo that Colombia remained \"by far, the closest US partner in the fight against narcotics in all of Latin America\".\n\n\"It's been almost three decades of US investment, training, and an unprecedented level of coordination,\" Ms Dickinson said.\n\nThe alliance has made Colombia and the US reliant on each other in terms of security. Today, thanks in part to US aid, Colombia has one of the most powerful militaries in Latin America.\n\nIn turn, Washington relies heavily on Bogotá for its counter-narcotics operations, Ms Dickinson explains.\n\n\"About 80% of the intelligence the US uses to intercept drugs in the Caribbean comes from Colombia.\"\n\nMilitary aid is not the only funding Colombia has received from the US in recent decades.\n\nWith the help of USAID - Washington's foreign policy and development aid agency - Colombia launched several peace and growth projects, especially in poor and conflict-ridden areas.\n\nBut earlier this year, the Trump administration announced the de facto dismantling of the agency.\n\nColombia, USAID's largest beneficiary in the region, saw many of its initiatives cancelled and dozens of jobs lost.\n\n\"The other sources of aid come from the State Department in the form of civilian and defense funding,\" Ms Dickinson explains.\n\nShe says that the assistance that exists today - which Trump appeared to refer to in his announcement of cuts - funds communications, intelligence, and equipment capabilities in Colombia, such as helicopters.\n\n\"But beyond these funding issues, the seizure, capture, and high-value operations that Colombia carries out are frequently co-ordinated with the United States,\" she continues.\n\n\"Not only is economic aid lost, but also the institutional relationship between the two countries combating a shared threat.\"\n\nIn mid-September, the US for the first time in 30 years,  officially named Colombia as a country which it said had \"demonstrably failed\" to uphold its obligations to control drug trafficking  - thereby opening the door to a funding cut.\n\nHowever, at the time Washington stopped shot of cutting the aid flow, leaving the move as a warning.\n\nBut just a month later, the feared cuts appear to be materialising.\n\nThe latest rift between Trump and Petro comes at perhaps the most inconvenient time possible for both administrations.\n\nPetro is fighting to bring \"total peace\" to Colombia, a campaign promise he made which this year appears to be collapsing with attacks by armed groups mounting in regions such as Catatumbo, Cauca, and Valle del Cauca, and culminating in the assassination of presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay in Bogotá.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is waging a controversial campaign against drug traffickers, and since September, US military vessels have attacked suspected drug boats, killing at least 37 people - 32 in strikes carried out in the Caribbean and five more in the first  such US attacks on two vessels in the Pacific, carried out on Wednesday.\n\nThis campaign has mainly been aimed at vessels alleged to have come from Venezuela, whose president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump accuses of being the leader of the Cartel of the Suns drug gang.\n\nMaduro has vehemently denied the accusation and said the strikes are aimed at ousting him from office.\n\nThe legality of the operations has also been questioned by legal experts who warn that they breach international law.\n\nOne of the most outspoken critics of the US strikes has been President Petro, who has called on the United Nations to open a \"criminal process\" against Trump for the strikes.\n\nNevertheless, both governments appear to need each other, although, in light of the recent tensions, they are also moving towards disengaging from each other.\n\nMr Galeano says that given their opposing views and outspoken style it was clear that relations between Petro and Trump were \"going to explode at any moment, especially after the US bombings of the boats in the Caribbean\".\n\nIn September,  Petro told BBC News  that Trump's attacks on boats were an \"act of tyranny\" and called for US officials to be prosecuted for \"murder\".\n\nLast Saturday, he echoed a report published by state-run media outlet RTVC alleging that a Colombian fisherman named Alejandro Carranza had been killed in a US strike on a boat on 16 September.\n\nHours later, Trump announced the suspension of aid and warned that if Petro did not stamp out drug production in Colombia, the US would do it for him \"and it won't be done nicely\".\n\nAccording to the Colombian Foreign Ministry, this constituted a threat \"to conduct an illegal intervention in Colombian territory\".\n\nMs Dickinson describes the deterioration in US-Colombian relations and the cuts in aid as \"a devastating blow\" and warns that they are likely to \"weaken the ability of security forces to control armed groups\".\n\nShe adds that it is \"difficult to understand\" why the US would take such a decision at a time when tensions are high in the region due to the US deployment in the Caribbean and Trump's declaration of an \"armed conflict\" with drug trafficking groups.\n\n\"Why confront your closest ally when regional security is already at stake?\" Ms Dickinson asks.\n\nMr Galeano also thinks that cracks in the once strong US-Colombian alliance carry risks for both countries.\n\n\"Colombia needs the US, and the US needs Colombia. There are military bases that the US uses in Colombia, with agreements even signed during Petro's administration,\" he explains.\n\n\"In all of this, the criminal gangs win.\"\n\n\"While Trump focusses on the Caribbean, traffickers smuggle drugs through the Pacific, from Ecuador and Colombia, which are reportedly the source of most narcotics shipped out of South America,\" the expert adds.\n\nSince Trump returned to the US presidency in January, the friction between his and Petro's governments has barely let up.\n\nWithin days, the two countries came close to a trade war after Petro turned back a flight carrying Colombian deportees from the US, denouncing the conditions in which they were traveling.\n\nThe trade war was quickly averted after some frantic negotiations, but the crisis set the tone of things to come.\n\nRead:  Co-operate or else: Trump's Colombia face-off is warning to all leaders\n\nWhen Colombian presidential candidate and opposition leader Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot dead in Bogotá in early June, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked his assassination to \"violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government\".\n\nWeeks later, both governments recalled their ambassadors for consultations, a move often interpreted in international relations as preceding the breaking off of bilateral relations.\n\nThe envoys remained in place, but Washington has since dealt further severe blows to the Petro government.\n\nNot only did it formally decertify Colombia as a partner in the war on drugs, but it also revoked Petro's visa after he led a pro-Palestinian protest in New York during his visit there for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nFollowing the suspension of US aid and amid the continuing tense antagonism between Petro and Trump many fear that relationship could deteriorate even further."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qpne1pz3jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"09:11:15.817+00:00","title":"Why has the US imposed sanctions on Russian oil companies?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US, under President Donald Trump, has imposed new sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies—Rosneft and Lukoil—as a direct economic pressure measure to compel Russia to end its war in Ukraine.

Russian oil companies?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has announced what he called \"tremendous\" new sanctions against two of Russia's largest oil companies, in a bid to pressure Moscow into ending its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe measures target Rosneft and Lukoil - two major oil corporations that help fund the Kremlin's \"war machine\", according to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThey represent the first direct interventions the Trump administration has imposed on Russia over its invasion, and have therefore been viewed as a geopolitically significant moment.\n\nThe sanctions, imposed by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), effectively blacklist Russia's two largest oil producers.\n\nRosneft, a state-controlled company headed by Russian President Vladimir Putin's close ally Igor Sechin, and Lukoil, a privately owned firm, account for nearly half of the nation's total crude-oil exports, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nBetween them, the two corporations export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day.\n\nRosneft alone is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production, which makes up 6% of the global output, according to estimates from the UK government.\n\nEnding the Russia-Ukraine war has become a focal point for Trump in recent months, and has gained new impetus after he helped to broker a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nA similar deal in Ukraine has so far eluded him, despite his campaign promises to solve the situation quickly. A summit with Putin in August failed to yield any tangible results, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow.\n\nThe US and its allies have so far been tentative about restricting the Russian energy industry, fearing wider impacts on the global economy.\n\nBut Trump has recently put more pressure on US allies to curb their spending on Russian oil - saying he would only issue sanctions when they did so.\n\nIt was Putin's refusal to end the \"senseless war\" that ultimately prompted the move, Bessent said on Wednesday.\n\nThe news comes a week after the UK imposed similar sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil - and just a day after the White House said a planned follow-up meeting with Putin in Budapest would be shelved.\n\n\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump explained. \"I just felt it was time. We waited a long time.\"\n\nThe impact is being seen as symbolic as well as economic, because Trump has so far pinned his hopes on brokering a peace deal and has resisted issuing sanctions.\n\nTwo former US ambassadors to Ukraine suggested that the significance of the move remained to be seen in the long term.\n\nThe sanctions \"will certainly hurt the Russian economy, which is already stumbling\", Ambassador John Herbst told the BBC. \"But I think it's naive to expect this step alone [will] push Putin to actually make peace and good faith.\"\n\n\"If we want Putin to actually negotiate in good faith, we have to maintain major pressure, economic and military, for many months. But this is a good start.\"\n\nBill Taylor, another former ambassador, told the BBC: \"These sanctions are an indication to President Putin that he has to come to the table.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly endorsed proposals to freeze the fighting along current frontlines, suggesting that territory should be \"cut the way it is\".\n\nRussia has pushed back against that idea, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov indicating Russia had not changed its position of wanting Ukrainian troops to leave the parts of the eastern Donbas region Kyiv still controls.\n\nThese new sanctions, against such a critical pillar of Russia's economy, could push it to reconsider that position. That is what the US is hoping for - though analysts who spoke to the BBC expected little immediate change on the ground.\n\nAccording to Dr Stuart Rollo, a research fellow at the University of Sydney's Centre for International Security Studies, the sanctions serve two primary goals - \"to materially impact Russia's industrial capacity to wage war, and to coerce Russia into accepting peace terms out of fear of the escalating impacts of sanctions on their economy and society\".\n\nDr Rollo added: \"They will not impact the former. They may impact the latter if a deft diplomatic balance is struck between the perceived consequences of continuing the war, and the benefits and concessions that will be furnished through a negotiated peace.\"\n\nMichael Raska, Assistant Professor in the Military Transformations Programme at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said that, in the near term, the sanctions were \"unlikely to alter the military balance in Ukraine\".\n\nBut, he added, \"as profit margins shrink, Russia will face difficult trade-offs between maintaining socio-economic stability, while financing a protracted war\".\n\nThese sanctions are sure to deal a blow to Russia's economy, with taxes from the oil and gas industries accounting for about a quarter of the nation's federal budget.\n\nBut the ripple effects could also be felt much further afield.\n\nOil and gas are Russia's biggest exports - with Moscow's biggest customers including China and India, the world's two most populous countries, and Turkey.\n\nTogether, China and India make up most of Russia's energy exports.\n\nChina last year purchased a record of more than 100 million tonnes of Russian crude oil, which accounted for almost 20% of its total energy imports.\n\nLikewise, oil exports to India, which made up only a small fraction of its imports before the Ukraine war, has since grown to some $140bn (£103.5bn) since 2022.\n\nTrump previously levied a 25% tariff on goods from India as what he called retaliation for such imports.\n\nAlthough Trump said Indian PM Narendra Modi had assured him during a phone call on Tuesday that Delhi \"was not going to buy much oil from Russia\" as he too \"wants to see the war end with Russia-Ukraine\".\n\nTrump is urging these countries to halt purchases of Russian oil altogether, forcing them to find alternative suppliers, possibly at a higher cost.\n\nBut refusal to do so could see China and India attracting secondary sanctions from the US.\n\nEdward Fishman, a former senior US State Department sanctions official, suggested the significance of the new sanctions depends on what happens next.\n\n\"Will the US actively threaten secondary sanctions on the Chinese banks, UAE traders, and Indian refineries that transact with Rosneft/Lukoil?\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"I expect, at the very least, some pullback from dealings with Russian oil in the short term.\"\n\nOn Thursday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Indian state refiners were reviewing their Russian oil trade documents to ensure that no supply would be coming directly from Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nAnd Reliance, Indian's top buyer of Russian oil, also said it was recalibrating its crude imports from Moscow in response to the sanctions.\n\nNews of Trump's sanctions has already caused global oil prices to rise, with Brent - a leading international crude oil benchmark - measuring a 5% surge.\n\nFor comparison, Brent measured a 1.6% rise following the UK's announcement of sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil last week.\n\nThat announcement led the Russian embassy in London to warn that targeting major Russian energy companies would disrupt global fuel supplies and increase costs worldwide - including for families and businesses in the UK.\n\nThose ominous projections don't appear to have materialised to any major degree - and pale in comparison to the uptick measured over the past 24 hours, as Trump's announcement fuels uncertainty.\n\nBut Dr Rollo suggests that, even in this more recent case, the surge is unlikely to continue.\n\n\"In the medium- to long-term, I don't expect that this will impact oil prices globally, unless secondary sanctions on shipping and finance related to these companies come to be strictly enforced,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Hoskins, Osmond Chia and James FitzGerald"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4d9kq2eno","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:45:41.412+00:00","title":"Delhi pollution: Indian capital's air has become toxic once again","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Delhi faces a recurring and severe air pollution crisis every winter, primarily due to a combination of firecrackers used during Diwali, crop residue burning in neighboring states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, and vehicle emissions.

once again\n\nEvery year, like clockwork, Delhi chokes.\n\nA thick, toxic haze settles over the city - stinging eyes, burning throats and sending air quality monitors into panic mode.\n\nFor the past few days, the air in Delhi and its neighbouring satellite cities has hovered between the \"poor\" and \"very poor\" categories.\n\nIt worsened sharply after Diwali, one of India's biggest festivals, as fireworks lit up the night sky and filled the air with smoke. Headlines reported that it was the worst post-Diwali air quality the city had experienced in the past four years.\n\nWith that, the city once again found itself confronting its annual, predictable - yet avoidable - crisis: air pollution.\n\nThere isn't a single factor to blame for the toxic air.\n\nIt's a combination of events - firecrackers, vehicular emissions and the burning of crop residue in the agrarian states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - that leads to the same outcome every year. And as it coincides with the start of winter, colder temperatures and low wind speeds trap pollutants close to the ground.\n\nThis year too, the same factors are believed to be at play - although there are contradictory reports about what contributed how much to the toxic air this year.\n\nIndian media reports, citing a climate research firm, say there has been a 77% decline in stubble-burning incidents this year because of the devastating floods that destroyed much of the region's crops earlier. It  blames firecrackers  as being the main cause for Delhi's poor air during the festive period.\n\nBut official data from Punjab tells a different story,  PTI news agency  reported. According to the regional pollution control board, stubble-burning incidents in the state have gone up three times in the past 10 days, with more than 350 cases reported - up from just 116 recorded until 11 October.\n\nIn the past few years, authorities have launched targeted campaigns to highlight the harmful impact of stubble burning and to promote the use of machinery as an alternative.\n\nThese efforts have shown some results on the ground. For instance, farm fires in Punjab fell to 10,909 cases last year as against 36,663 in 2023. But despite the decline, it continues for a simple reason: affordability. It remains the cheapest way to clear fields.\n\nAnd while successive governments have spoken about providing machinery and financial incentives to discourage crop burning, very little has changed on the ground.\n\nThe other major contributor to Delhi's pollution in this season is firecrackers.\n\nJust days before the Diwali festival, India's top court relaxed a five-year ban on selling and bursting of crackers in Delhi and surrounding areas. It permitted the use of less-polluting \"green crackers\" for six hours over two days over the festival. Experts criticised the order saying \"green crackers\" are only 20-to-30% less polluting and still release harmful particles that degrade air quality.\n\nAlso, the reality on the ground was far from what the court mandated and the restrictions were openly flouted.\n\nIn many parts of the capital, fireworks started early in the morning and continued well past midnight. And not all of them were \"green crackers\" either. In the run-up to Diwali, BBC reporters saw more polluting crackers also being sold openly in shops.\n\nThe polluted air that people are being forced to breathe has residents complaining of coughing, watery eyes and breathlessness. And doctors say long-term exposure gradually weakens the body's natural defences, making people more prone to a host of serious ailments.\n\nYet, the human cost of pollution rarely becomes a priority for the region's elected representatives, as political parties resort to the familiar cycle of blame every year.\n\nThis year too, the Delhi government and the one in Punjab have been engaged in a war of words.\n\nDelhi's Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused Punjab officials of \"forcing farmers to burn stubble\" to deliberately worsen the capital's air.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which governs Punjab, dismissed the allegations and, in turn, accused the Delhi government of \"lying about pollution\" and \"playing with people's lives\".\n\nMeanwhile, experts and some citizens say the only way forward is through collective, long-term solutions, where both state and federal governments work together rather than relying on temporary, reactionary pollution control measures each winter.\n\nFor now, as winter creeps in, Delhi and much of northern India choke once again - a tragic annual routine that shows no signs of ending.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8vr95n5n3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:17:51.288+00:00","title":"France backing away from pledge to intercept migrant boats, sources tell BBC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France is scaling back on its commitment to intercept migrant boats crossing the English Channel, despite earlier promises made during a July 2025 summit between President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

It's much blah-blah,\" said one figure closely linked to French maritime security.\n\nThe maritime prefecture for the Channel told the BBC that the new doctrine on taxi-boats was \"still being studied\".\n\nFormer Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was widely credited, not least in the UK, with driving a more aggressive approach in the Channel.\n\nThat culminated last July with a summit between President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nThe focus then was on plans to intercept the so-called \"taxi boats\" now used by the smugglers to cruise close to the coastline, collecting passengers already standing in the water.\n\nFrench police rarely intervene against the overcrowded taxi-boats since it's considered too great a risk to both officers and civilians.\n\nBut days before the summit,  we witnessed French police wading into the sea , south of Boulogne, to slash the sides of a taxi-boat as it got caught in the waves and drifted close to shore.\n\nIn London, the prime minister's spokesman reacted immediately to our footage, calling it \"a really significant moment\" and proof that the French were already starting to take tougher action to stop the small boats on shore and, potentially, at sea.\n\nSoon afterwards, a well-placed source in the French interior ministry told the BBC that policy changes were imminent.\n\n\"We will start interventions at sea in the very next few days, after the revision of the doctrine,\" said the source.\n\nBut since then, Retailleau has lost his job as minister in the latest of several chaotic reshuffles, and a distracted French government appears to be focused on other crises.\n\n\"It's possible that (the new measures at sea) might never happen,\" said Peter Walsh, who researches the issue at Oxford's Migration Observatory.\n\nThe migrant boats meanwhile are still leaving France, and not just from the beaches.\n\nA retired chip shop owner who lives beside a canal just inland from the coast at Gravelines said he had seen four leave in a single day.\n\nHe showed us videos of the boats, including images of people scrambling onboard in the middle of the canal, and of a police patrol boat recently circling another inflatable while making no attempt to block it from leaving.\n\n\"It's mad, mad, mad. You have to stop the boats,\" said Jean Deldicque.\n\nA marine expert, who asked us not to use their name due to their close ties to the state, said the Canal de L'Aa was shallow enough for security forces to intervene without putting people's lives at serious risk.\n\nOther canals and rivers in the area have sometimes been blocked by ropes or chains, but these have often proved ineffective against the highly adaptive smuggling gangs.\n\nWhile French politics has clearly played a role in frustrating British government attempts to slow down the number of small-boat crossings, legal and moral issues are also proving crucial.\n\nA major obstacle, cited by several sources, to stopping the inflatables at sea is the fear that it would, almost inevitably, lead to more deaths and to prosecutions of those security forces involved.\n\n\"The French navy is against this. They realise this kind of mission is extremely dangerous and they risk being implicated and ending up in court. It's going to be a disaster,\" said one source.\n\nEven the less ambitious idea, talked up by British officials, of giving the French police more legal latitude to intervene from the beaches and go deeper into the water to stop the boats has been rejected. If, indeed, it was ever truly considered.\n\nCurrent rules allow French police and firefighters to intervene in shallow water only to rescue people who appear to be in imminent danger. That is clearly what we witnessed on Ecault beach near Boulogne in early July.\n\nThere has been confusion from the start about French commitment on this issue. Several French security sources have told us that getting the police to stop the boats by wading into the sea was never even a remote possibility.\n\nBut French unions have suggested that changes were considered and rejected.\n\nPolice union spokesman Jean-Pierre Cloez said the interior minister's plans raised earlier this year were now \"on hold\".\n\n\"We considered at the time it was [too] dangerous. The rules, for the moment, are the same. There's no change in the way we do things.\"\n\nMr Cloez and others also all mentioned an ongoing lack of equipment, training and personnel.\n\nNone of this means that France is abandoning its commitment to patrol its beaches, or to intercept the smugglers and their boats on land.\n\nThe operation is sizeable, sophisticated, and stretches along more than 150km (90 miles) of coastline.\n\nThe UK is paying for a significant share of the work under the terms of the Sandhurst Treaty, currently being renegotiated for renewal next year.\n\nMeanwhile volunteer rescue crews working along the northern French coast continue to pull people, and sometimes bodies, out of the water.\n\nSome volunteers have expressed frustration at being repeatedly asked by the maritime authorities to escort inflatable boats towards British waters: a process that can take many hours.\n\nBut they have also highlighted the unique challenges facing anyone seeking to intervene at in the Channel.\n\n\"Odd as it may seem, if they don't request assistance, you cannot force them to accept it,\" says Gérard Barron, the head of Boulogne's sea-rescue volunteers.\n\n\"The crew has reported to me that on occasion, when they have approached a dinghy carrying too many people and asked if they want assistance, they have seen knives flashed.\n\n\"They have also, on occasion, seen young men holding infants over the water, threatening to drop them if we got any closer.\"\n\nAfter 45 years of experience in rescues, Barron admits to a certain exasperation with France's current failure to do more to stop the smugglers.\n\nIf existing rules against putting to sea in flimsy, unlicensed and overcrowded boats were enforced, he thinks many lives would be saved.\n\nAdditional reporting by Paul Pradier\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xvj108z9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"09:03:18.214+00:00","title":"Rubio warns against West Bank annexation after Israel's parliament advances move","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Israeli Knesset passed a controversial bill granting preliminary approval for the annexation of the West Bank, raising alarm from US officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, who warn that such a move threatens the fragile ceasefire in Gaza and undermines the Trump administration’s peace plan.

gunfire aimed at incoming Ukrainian drones are becoming increasingly common, as Kyiv retaliates against repeated bombardments of its cities with cross-border strikes of its own.\n\n\"It's so loud and so terrifying,\" says Nina, a Belgorod resident who asked us to change her name.\n\n\"I was coming back from the clinic when a siren went off. As usual, I received Telegram alerts about a drone attack. Then bursts of automatic gunfire broke out, I ran into a nearby courtyard and tried to hide under an arch,\" she recalls.\n\n\"The next day it all happened again - air defence fire, automatic gunfire, explosions.\"\n\nThe number of Ukrainian drone attacks on the Belgorod region has increased nearly fourfold since the start of 2025, according to BBC News Russian analysis based on data from local authorities.\n\nIn September, more than 4,000 Ukrainian drones were recorded in the Belgorod region, compared with around 1,100 in January 2025. In one of the biggest strikes last month, the region was attacked with more than 260 drones, according to the governor. There has also been an increase in missile attacks since the summer.\n\nUkraine continues to suffer far greater losses from Russia's near-daily missile and drone strikes, which routinely kill civilians and leave cities across the country without power and heat.\n\nAt least seven people were killed, including two children, in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight into Wednesday, and there are fears that the coming winter may be the harshest yet for Ukraine.\n\nRead more :  What's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?\n\nEU set to endorse deal to turn frozen Russian assets into support for Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say the recent surge of attacks on Belgorod, some of which have caused huge blackouts, is a direct result of Russia's latest onslaught on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\n\n\"Maybe they should stop being too comfortable there in Belgorod?\" Zelensky said earlier this month. \"They must understand: if they want to leave us without power, then we will do the same\".\n\nBelgorod region is a key logistics corridor and staging hub for Russian forces near the border with Ukraine. It is also a regular point of origin for artillery and short-range drone strikes.\n\nAlthough there were local electricity outages in smaller towns in the region earlier in the war, the city of Belgorod was largely unaffected by power cuts until this autumn.\n\nLocal student Ekaterina (not her real name) told the BBC she was at home in the city on the evening of 28 September, when notifications started appearing on her phone: \"Missile alert! Take shelter!\"\n\nThe sound of howling sirens followed, and the lights in her flat started flickering.\n\n\"We ran to the corridor, because the explosions started almost immediately. They were very loud. The lights blinked and went out,\" Ekaterina recalls.\n\nMissiles had hit the main Belgorod heat and power plant and a substation, local Telegram channels reported.\n\nAnd while the city centre had its electricity back relatively quickly, some in the suburbs were left without power until morning. Across the region, around 77,000 people, or 5% of the population, still had no electricity the next day.\n\n\"While you're in the office in the centre, you wouldn't necessarily notice that there was a blackout. But when you're going home it's like entering a whole different world,\" another Belgorod resident Natalya (not her real name) tells the BBC.\n\n\"Complete darkness outside. Apartment blocks are without power, the shops are dark too. As you ride through the darkness, it's hard to tell where your stop is - you can't see anything\".\n\nAnother big blackout came less than a week later.\n\nAuthorities admit they do not have the capacity to provide everyone with back-up generators and have called on residents to buy their own.\n\n\"But what are we suppose to fuel them with, given the fuel crisis?\" Maria, an elderly resident who also asked to change her name, tells the BBC.\n\nMore than half of Russia's regions, including Belgorod, have been affected by petrol and diesel shortages, due to increased Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries.\n\n\"And the prices for generators have shot up as well,\" Maria says.\n\nUkraine has increased production of its \"Darts\" drone - lightweight and cheap models that can carry a 4kg (9lb) warhead - and many Belgorod residents say this is the reason the strikes have become more frequent. The drones are effective both for single and mass launches which can potentially overload air defence systems.\n\nBut the recent strikes on energy infrastructure that caused the blackouts in Belgorod are more likely to have involved heavier weapons. Reports say long-range Himars rockets or Morok drones with larger warheads might have been used.\n\nAnd while for many in Russia the war still seems far away, residents of Belgorod region now feel its impact daily, like Ukrainians over the border.\n\n\"Until September, the war seemed to have faded into the background again. But now we are getting constant reminders - through power outages, fuel shortages, and a general sense of anxiety\", says Yakov, who declined to give his real name.\n\n\"I personally have a strong feeling that, by continuing the war, Russia is racing headlong toward the abyss\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Ilya Abishev"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm27xnvz2eyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"02:40:06.337+00:00","title":"British man drowns in Australia after surfboard snaps","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British man and his 43-year-old friend both died after a surfboard snapped during extreme weather conditions at Frankston Beach, Victoria, Australia.

Trump has said the \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing must be torn down in order to construct a new $250m (£186m) ballroom.\n\nCrews began demolishing parts of the structure on Monday, and two administration officials earlier told the BBC's US partner CBS that it will be completely torn down by the weekend.\n\nIt marks a significant expansion of the construction project announced over the summer. Trump previously said his ballroom addition would not \"interfere with the current building\".\n\nHe rejected accusations he had not been transparent over the extent of the works, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"I think we've been more transparent than anyone's ever been.\"\n\nBut criticism from conservationists and opposition politicians has intensified as the scale of the works comes into focus. Many have suggested that the project should have faced more scrutiny.\n\nThe White House is considered a special building that is exempt from the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which would ordinarily require public reviews of projects in which historic buildings are impacted.\n\nHowever, Prof Priya Jain, the chair of a heritage preservation committee at the Society of Architectural Historians, said she \"would be surprised if that process was not followed at the White House in the past\".\n\n\"That process is so well established, and is followed on thousands of buildings, and would have been best practice,\" Prof Jain explained to the BBC.\n\nThe White House has served as the historic home of the US president for two centuries. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and was last modified in 1942.\n\nIt is a section of the White House that holds offices for the first lady and other staff, as well as meetings and special events.\n\nTrump said the building had gone through several changes over the years and was \"very, very much changed from what it was originally\".\n\nHe added that was \"never thought of as being much\" and that the changes have been wanted \"for at least 150 years\".\n\nThe  construction was being fully funded  by Trump and \"some friends of mine - donors\". The military was also involved, he added.\n\nThe US president announced construction had begun in a social media post on Monday, saying \"ground has been broken\" on the \"much-needed\" ballroom space.\n\nHe said that the East Wing was \"completely separate\" from the White House, although it is attached to the main structure.\n\nThe Trump administration officials told CBS it was always the case that the East Wing would have to be modernised to enhance security and technology, but that during the planning process, it became apparent that the best option would be to demolish the entirety of the East Wing.\n\nTrump's comments came after the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington non-profit organisation that protects historic US sites, wrote a letter to White House officials saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the project.\n\nThe trust asked Trump to pause demolition work, arguing that the White House was a national historic landmark and that officials needed to hold a public review process of the plan for the ballroom.\n\nSome Democrats have been critical of the renovation, including Hilary Clinton, who ran against Trump for the US presidency in 2016.\n\nIn a post on X, she wrote that the White House was not Trump's house, and \"he's destroying it\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

businesses, typically big firms in Europe and North America.\n\nExamples include call-centres in the Philippines, IT operations in India, and South African companies that offer auditing and other finance work.\n\nBack in 2022, Mr Dywili had earned enough money to build a new house for his parents and siblings.

Firms in countries such as the UK have been moving work abroad due to both a drive to cut costs, and a reported  lack of available UK staff  in sectors such as accountancy.\n\nWith salaries in South Africa around half of those in the UK, the country's outsourced services industry has developed a niche in financial services, along with IT and software development, data analytics and digital marketing.\n\nEnglish language proficiency, a high level of education, and a time difference of just one or two hours with the UK also appeal to big companies.\n\n\"There's just such a great work ethic in South Africa, and an energy about South Africans,\" says Simon Wheeler, a Durban-based chartered accountant who also works in the sector.\n\n\"We're go-getters and give 110% to everything. So South Africans are really grabbing these opportunities with both hands, and taking full advantage of them.\n\n\"It now gives them that opportunity to take their career to new heights, and get that experience whilst in the country, as traditionally, it always used to be that you would have to relocate outside of South Africa to get that international experience.\"\n\nThe outsourcing sector now contributes 35bn rand ($2bn; £1.5bn) to the South African economy per year,  according to figures  from the Western Cape regional government.\n\nNezaam Joseph is chief director in the Department of Economic Development for the Western Cape government, where around 60 outsourcing firms are based. The department has been one of the earliest supporters of the sector, says Mr Joseph.\n\nAround six years ago, it began offering outsourced services firms in the province 3,500 South African rand per month, as part of a subsidised training programme for around 4,500 people a year. It says that around 80% of those people have gone on to be hired by firms full time.\n\nMr Joseph says that more than 70,000 people are now employed in the Cape to service the outsourced needs of overseas companies. \"We added about 10,000 jobs last year, and another 10,000 plus jobs this year. Fifteen years ago, we had less than 2,000 offshore jobs.\"\n\nUK accountancy firm Cooper Parry is one British company that has outsourced work to South Africa. It turned to South African outsourcing finance firms Makosi and PKF Octagon to fill hundreds of roles during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nGemma Edwards, a partner at Cooper Parry and its head of transformation and business services, says the company was so impressed with its South African partners that it recently opened an office of its own in the country. This now has 60 team members, including both Mr Dywili and Mr Wheeler.\n\nMs Edwards says the South African employees \"have become an extension of our UK teams\".  She adds: \"They join the same calls as us… it's not them and us - we're one global team.\"\n\nUK call-centre firm Ventrica, which works with brands such as shoemaker Clarks and McDonald's, opened an operation in South Africa in 2022. Around 30% of its workforce is now based there, with plans to grow this to 40%.\n\nVentrica's chief executive Iain Banks says that its cost-conscious clients are happy for their call-centre operations to be based in South Africa, while others believe that their business is safer remaining in the UK.\n\n\"For example, there's a FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] brand we move with,\" says Mr Banks. \"And if I were to embark on a conversation about South Africa, they would march out the door straight away.\"\n\nThat may change though, as more and more highly educated South Africans enter the industry.  That is certainly what Mr Joseph anticipates, as the Western Cape government plans to work more closely with universities to make curriculums a better fit for what outsourcing industry employers need.\n\nBut Jee-A van der Linde, a Cape Town-based senior economist, is concerned that, despite those ambitions, the South African education system isn't going to be able to keep pace with the outsourcing industry's growth, both in size and in importance to the country.\n\n\"The quality of education, from a social perspective, is one of the biggest hindrances for the South African economy, and a big reason for the skills deficit that we have in South Africa,\" he says.\n\nHe's also concerned that not all opportunities in the South African outsourcing industry are being spread equally across the country. While many jobs could be done remotely, unstable internet connections in rural areas would rule this out.\n\n\"South Africa is a relatively big country,\" adds Mr van der Linde. \"You have your major hubs like Johannesburg and Durban, but there are gaps in how different parties govern different provinces. Some have a more business-friendly mindset.\n\n\"With those disparities, it's natural you'll likely end up with an imbalance in terms of how the outsourcing industry can actually impact unemployment across the whole country.\"\n\nYet if the Western Cape government's university collaboration strategy proves successful, it won't just mean more jobs, but likely rising salaries, too. So what happens then to all the companies relying on South Africa's cost effectiveness?\n\nThey'll look further across Africa, predicts Ventrica's Mr Banks, who says outsourcing industries are already emerging in Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\n\"It started with India as the first offshoring location,\" says Mr Banks. \"It then went to the Philippines, and now South Africa is booming. But South Africa will get to a point where it will peak out, and then the industry needs to find another location, and that appears to be elsewhere in Africa,\" says Mr Banks.\n\nBut in the meantime, Mr Dywili says that opportunities in the sector in South Africa provide a palpable, but rare, sense of optimism for youngsters in the country.\n\n\"Young people have felt demoralised by the limited opportunities we've had here in South Africa,\" he says. Mr Dywili adds that more are choosing to get degrees such as in accountancy that provide a pathway to work in the outsourcing industry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykd4l3dy1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"09:06:48.394+00:00","title":"EU set to endorse deal to turn frozen Russian assets into support for Ukraine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The European Union is set to endorse a controversial 'reparations loan' plan to provide Ukraine with €140bn from frozen Russian state assets currently held in Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial institution.

Ukraine\n\nEuropean leaders aim to endorse controversial plans to use Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday.\n\nThe unprecedented proposal for what the EU has dubbed a \"reparations loan\" - would see Kyiv receive €140bn (£121bn) worth of frozen Russian state assets currently held by Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution.\n\nThe plan has been months in the making, partly due to the legal complexities surrounding it, as well as concerns from member states about upsetting global financial stability.\n\nBelgium in particular has been reluctant to back using the frozen assets, as it is nervous about having to shoulder any potential consequences should Russia legally challenge Euroclear.\n\nRussia has reacted angrily to any suggestions that the EU could use its money.\n\n\"Any confiscatory initiatives from Brussels will inevitably result in a painful response,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.\n\nFor the EU, the problem of how to continue to support Kyiv's struggle against Russian aggression has become more urgent since US support for Ukraine has dwindled.\n\nAs of July, EU member states have provided about €177.5bn (£154bn) in financial support for Ukraine. But in the absence of any progress towards a ceasefire deal, Ukraine will need more money as Russia's full-scale war approaches its fifth year.\n\nThe price tag of Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery is also estimated by the UN and World Bank to be well above $486bn (£365bn; €420bn).\n\nAbout €210bn (£182bn) in Russian investments was frozen by the EU when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThe biggest share – some €185bn – is sitting in Euroclear, a clearing house for financial transactions in Brussels which operates under EU jurisdiction.\n\nWhen they were first frozen, the majority of these Russian investments were in the form of sovereign bonds – a type of loan made to a government which is paid back over a period of time.\n\nThese bonds have now matured; in other words, Russia is due to get both its initial loan back as well as interest. But because of the sanctions imposed against it in 2022, Moscow cannot access this money.\n\nThe EU has been using the interest from Russian frozen assets for Ukraine's defence since spring 2024, and that amounts to up to €3bn per year.\n\nThe EU is now considering redirecting the frozen funds themselves to Ukraine as a zero-interest \"reparations loan\". The much-needed liquidity would be available immediately – on the understanding that Kyiv would repay it through reparations from Moscow once the war ends.\n\nInternational law stipulates that sovereign assets cannot be confiscated outright. Although frozen, these assets remain Moscow's property and seizing them is legally challenging.\n\nTo get around this issue the EU could \"borrow\" Russia's frozen money held by Euroclear and replace it with an IOU backed by all member states underwriting the debt.\n\nThis could also offset Euroclear's concerns on how to pay Russia back, should the war end suddenly and Moscow demand its assets back.\n\nOn Thursday morning Belgium was still expressing criticism of the proposal but leaving the door open to it, if it received guarantees that the risk would be shared by all member states.\n\nEU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas told the BBC's Today programme that Belgium's concerns were \"understandable\" and that the Belgians \"should not bear the risk alone\".\n\nRussia is furious with the idea of its investments being used.\n\nThe move would be the \"theft of the century\" and trigger retaliation and damage Western financial stability, Russia's ambassador to Italy Alexey Paramonov said.\n\nIf EU leaders green-light the reparations at Thursday's summit, the European Commission will begin drawing up the formal legal proposal for the loan.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the \"reparations loan\" scenario is that it hinges on Ukraine winning the war and Russia accepting to pay damages.\n\nThere is no guarantee Russia will agree to this. If it doesn't, the EU could forgive Kyiv's debt – but it would still have to repay the money it borrowed to fund the IOU to Euroclear.\n\nThat burden would effectively fall to European taxpayers – an uncomfortable option for most European governments.\n\nThere is also concern among Europe's central bankers about potentially setting a difficult legal precedent that could undermine global financial stability - as well as putting off other countries from placing their safe haven assets in the West.\n\nNeither Euroclear nor EU countries want to be seen as unreliable depositories of foreign wealth. Even in the context of Russia's war, they need to respect the international monetary order.\n\nPoland, as well as Scandinavian and Baltic countries, have enthusiastically endorsed the plan, which Finland's President Alexander Stubb called \"ingenious\".\n\n\"I think it's going to work and will help Ukraine to fund itself,\" he said.\n\nOther European leaders more sympathetic to Moscow, like Hungary's Viktor Orban and Slovakia's Robert Fico, may well oppose it.\n\nIf the plan led Moscow to retaliate against Hungarian companies, Orban said, it would be difficult to explain to Hungarians \"why they should support the confiscation of frozen Russian assets\".\n\nHowever, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that while the decision should \"ideally\" be unanimous, it could also just be adopted by a large majority - which would circumvent Budapest's veto.\n\nAnother sticking point revolves around how Ukraine would be allowed to spend the money.\n\nUkraine is facing a €42bn deficit in its 2026 \"survival budget\", according to the Ukrainian Centre for Economic Strategy.\n\nBrussels and Paris would like to use the financing to provide budgetary support to Kyiv, said Mujtaba Rahman, Managing Director for Europe at Eurasia Group.\n\nOthers, like Germany, want Ukraine to commit to spending the funds on buying European weapons.\n\nIt is \"important that these additional funds are solely used to finance Ukraine's military equipment\", Merz wrote in the Financial Times, adding that EU member states and Ukraine would \"jointly determine\" which weapons to procure.\n\nFor its part Kyiv is pushing back against any limit on its use of the frozen Russian assets.\n\nIryna Mudra, a top legal adviser in the Ukrainian administration, told Reuters that \"the victim, not the donors or partners, must determine how to address its most urgent defence, recovery and compensation needs\".\n\nUkraine reserved the right to decide how to allocate resources, Ms Mudra said, adding that some would have to go towards other sectors like reconstruction and victim compensation."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9k2w8ell0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"00:36:29.084+00:00","title":"US forces kill two in strike on alleged drug boat in the Pacific","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant escalation of its anti-drug campaign, the United States conducted its first military strike in the Pacific Ocean, killing two people on a vessel believed to be carrying drugs.

York City traded blows at their final debate on Wednesday night - a last attempt to show voters their ideas and leadership style.\n\nAnd this time, they had an audience. Supporters and spectators packed a university auditorium to cheer and occasionally chide them.\n\nOver 90 minutes, three moderators touched on housing, Israel and Gaza, and the current occupant of the White House.\n\nThere was little new ground covered from last week's showdown, but the debate was treated as the last high-profile chance to sell a vision before election day on 4 November.\n\nDemocrat Zohran Mamdani remained the candidate to beat. Recent polls suggest he holds a double-digit lead over his key opponents, Republican Curtis Sliwa and independent Andrew Cuomo.\n\nThe candidates pushed each other on policies during the first televised debate last week. But this time, the gloves were off - just days before early voting begins on Saturday.\n\nPerhaps fuelled by the live audience in the borough of Queens, the attacks became more heated and personal.\n\nMamdani, positioned at centre stage, called Cuomo \"a desperate man\". The former governor told his rival \"you never show up for work\" as a state assemblyman - which Mamdani denies.\n\nMamdani fired at Cuomo: \"In his own words, that the city is getting screwed by the state. Who was leading the state? It was you.\"\n\nMamdani took heat from both men, including one exchange when Sliwa and Cuomo demanded he clarify his position on affordable housing ballot initiatives that voters  also consider 4 November.\n\n\"I have not yet taken a position on those,\" Mamdani said, prompting jeers from his opponents.\n\n\"What a shocker,\" Cuomo quipped as Sliwa slapped his palm to his forehead.\n\nLater, NY1 anchor and debate moderator Errol Louis chided Mamdani and Cuomo after another argument broke out about the former governor's record. \"You can't talk over each other,\" he said.\n\nSliwa took swings at both opponents for their prior records, arguing he was the only candidate who could keep New Yorkers safe. At one point, criticising the subway system during Cuomo's term as governor, Sliwa declared: \"I don't trust you.\"\n\nEven after the debate, Sliwa continued to throw punches.\n\nHe promised to be Mamdani's \"worst nightmare\" should the assemblyman win, and mused Cuomo likely \"had a couple Red Bulls\" before appearing on stage.\n\nIn a repeat of the first debate, both Sliwa and Mamdani invoked the sexual harassment allegations that led to Cuomo resigning from the governor's office in 2021.\n\nCuomo has denied the allegations and aggressively pushed back against his accusers' claims.\n\nMamdani announced that one of Cuomo's accusers was in the debate audience.\n\n\"What do you say to the 13 women who you sexually harassed?\" Mamdani asked, invoking the allegations.\n\nCuomo said the cases had been dropped and again denied wrongdoing.\n\nHe also went after Mamdani for a scandal that has dogged him: a photo of him posing and smiling with a Ugandan official who has pushed anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in that country.\n\n\"Had I known that the first deputy minister was the architect of that legislation, I would not have taken that photo,\" responded Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, countering that Cuomo had no policies to protect LGBTQ+ New Yorkers.\n\nIn a possible preview of future Trump administration actions in the city, federal immigration officers spilled onto a block in New York City's Chinatown neighbourhood on Tuesday, detaining several street vendors and sparking fury from residents.\n\nMr Louis asked each candidate to respond to the raid, and - bigger picture - explain how they would engage with the White House.\n\nIn a rare moment of agreement, all three said that the New York City Police Department should have dealt with any illegal street vending issues, not federal officers. But they took different approaches to dealing with Trump.\n\n\"With Trump, it's always the art of the deal. You have to negotiate,\" Sliwa, the Republican, said.\n\nMamdani alleged that Cuomo was \"Donald Trump's puppet\".\n\nThough Mamdani said he would oppose Trump's deportation initiatives, when it came to tackling the cost of living, he said he was ready to work with the president.\n\nCuomo said that only he had the relevant experience dealing with Trump to ensure New Yorkers got a fair deal.\n\n\"He puts his finger in your chest, and you have to put your finger right back in his chest,\" he said.\n\nThe war in the Middle East has had a profound impact on the New York City mayoral race.\n\nMamdani made his pro-Palestine views central to his candidacy, despite critics accusing him of encouraging antisemitism and insufficiently denouncing the phrase \"globalise the intifada\".\n\nCuomo again accused Mamdani of fanning \"the flames of hatred against Jews\", while Sliwa said the state assemblyman, who represents a section of Queens, \"had a lot of explaining to do\".\n\nMamdani repeated a pledge from the first debate to serve as mayor for \"all New Yorkers\", including Jewish residents who support Israel.\n\nBut he defended himself against accusations that he held extreme views: \"It has to do with the fact that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice\" of being mayor of New York City, Mamdani said.\n\nMr Louis also asked the staunchly pro-Israel Cuomo: \"What would you say to, and how would you handle New Yorkers who are in the streets of your care protesting the actions of the Netanyahu government?\"\n\nMany large demonstrations for Palestinians' rights have taken place in New York City throughout the conflict, and Columbia University experienced over a year of protests from students who opposed Israel's military actions in Gaza.\n\n\"That's your right. Protest. Demonstrate. Disagree. God bless America, God bless New York City,\" Cuomo said. \"That doesn't justify antisemitic behaviour.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6758pn6ylo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:45:10.674+00:00","title":"US sanctions Russian oil companies after failed Putin talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in a direct effort to pressure Moscow into negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine.

oil companies in an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement came one day after US President Donald Trump said a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Budapest would be shelved indefinitely.\n\n\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump said.\n\nWhile the economic impact to Russia is likely to be minimal, it represents a major shift in Trump's foreign policy, having previously said he would not impose sanctions until European nations ceased buying Russian oil. The Kremlin said Russia was \"immune\" to the sanctions.\n\nTrump had repeatedly threatened tougher measures against Moscow, but has avoided them until now in hopes of brokering a peace deal in the three-and-a-half year long invasion.\n\nHis administration has sought to cast the US as a somewhat neutral mediator between the two warring nations, after years of full-throated support for Ukraine from his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nBut the US president has grown increasingly exasperated with the Kremlin over its failure to move forward with negotiations.\n\nThe sanctions are also something Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, has been urging for months. He said they were a \"good signal\" from the US, adding that a ceasefire was possible if other nations applied more pressure on Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump criticised Putin for not being serious about making peace and said that he hoped that the sanctions would force a breakthrough.\n\n\"I just felt it was time. We waited a long time,\" he said.\n\nHe called the sanctions package \"tremendous\", adding that he hoped they could be swiftly withdrawn if Russia agreed to stop the war.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the sanctions were needed due to \"Putin's refusal to end this senseless war\".\n\nHe said the affected oil companies - Rosneft and Lukoil - funded the Kremlin's \"war machine\".\n\nOil and gas are Russia's biggest exports. The two Russian oil firms export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. Rosneft is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production, which makes up 6% of the global output, according to UK government estimates.\n\nMoscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey. Trump has also urged these countries to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.\n\nIndia is poised to sharply reduce Russian oil imports in light of Trump's announcement, news agency Reuters reports, citing unnamed industry sources. China has said it opposes the US sanctions.\n\nUkraine has in recent months targeted Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure in an attempt to hurt its economy.\n\nZelensky had visited the White House on Friday, seeking to acquire long-range Tomahawk missiles that could strike deep into Russian territory, but came away empty-handed.\n\nThe day before, Trump had announced the proposal to meet Putin in Hungary after an unscheduled call from the Russian leader.\n\nBut following a call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, the idea was put on hold, with Trump saying he didn't want a \"wasted meeting\".\n\nTrump later said he had refused to give Ukraine the missiles as they were \"highly complex\" and took a year of intense training to use. Zelensky appeared to suggest that, like with the sanctions, Trump may change his mind in the future.\n\nFighting on the ground continued overnight, with strikes on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killing at least two people, officials said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Russia unleashed an intense bombardment that killed at least seven people in Ukraine, including children.\n\nMeanwhile, power was restored to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, in what the UN's atomic watchdog called \"a crucial step for nuclear safety and security\". It had been without electricity for 30 days, leading to fears of a meltdown.\n\nLast week,  the UK slapped a similar sanctions package on Rosneft and Lukoil , with Chancellor Rachel Reeves stating that \"there is no place for Russian oil on global markets\".\n\nRussia's embassy in London said targeting its country's major energy companies would disrupt global fuel supplies and drive up costs worldwide. It added: \"Pressure only complicates peaceful dialogue and leads to further escalation.\"\n\nEurope's reliance on Russian oil and gas has fallen dramatically since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but Russian gas still accounts for 13% of EU imports - though the bloc has pledged to phase it out completely.\n\nTrump had previously said he would only impose further sanctions on Moscow if Europe completely stopped buying Russian energy.\n\nEU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen praised a new sanctions package approved by the EU on Wednesday, which includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports by 2028.\n\nShe said this, along with the US sanctions, were \"a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor\".\n\nEarlier this year,  the UK and US also sanctioned major Russian energy companies  Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.\n\nNato Secretary General Mark Rutte was at the White House when the sanctions were announced, and praised the move for \"putting more pressure\" on Putin.\n\nHe was expected to discuss a 12-point plan formulated by European allies and Kyiv that would see the current front lines frozen, a return of deported children as well as a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe plan also includes a war recovery fund for Ukraine, as well as security guarantees and a clear pathway for Ukraine to join the EU.\n\nTrump has indicated that a key sticking point has been Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line - something Zelensky is in favour of.\n\nRussia has pushed back against that idea, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov indicating Russia had not changed its position of wanting Ukrainian troops to leave the parts of the eastern Donbas region Kyiv still controls.\n\nAdditional reporting by Pritti Mistry and Danielle Kaye\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

help\n\nWhen insurgents finally gained control of the town of Kyaukme - on the main trade route from the Chinese border to the rest of Myanmar - it was after several months of hard fighting last year.\n\nKyaukme straddles Asian Highway 14, more famous as the Burma Road during the Second World War, and its capture by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) was seen by many as a pivotal victory for the opposition. It suggested that the morale of the military junta which had seized power in 2021 might be crumbling.\n\nThis month, though, it took just three weeks for the army to recapture Kyaukme.\n\nThe fluctuating fate of this little hill town is a stark illustration of how far the military balance in Myanmar has now shifted, in favour of the junta.\n\nKyaukme has paid a heavy price. Large parts of the town have been flattened by daily air strikes carried out by the military while it was in the hands of the TNLA. Air force jets dropped 500-pound bombs, while artillery and drones hit insurgent positions outside the town. Much of the population fled the town, though they are starting to return now the military has retaken it.\n\n\"There is heavy fighting going on every day, in Kyaukme and Hsipaw,\" Tar Parn La, a spokesman for the TNLA, told the BBC earlier this month. \"This year the military has more soldiers, more heavy weapons, and more air power. We are trying our best to defend Hsipaw.\"\n\nSince the BBC spoke to him the junta's forces have also retaken Hsipaw, the last of the towns captured by the TNLA last year, restoring its control over the road to the Chinese border.\n\nThese towns fell primarily because China has thrown its weight behind the junta, backing its plan to hold an election in December. This plan has been widely condemned because it excludes Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, which won the last election but its government was ousted in the coup, and because so much of Myanmar is in a state of civil war.\n\nThat is why the military is currently trying to take back as much lost territory as it can, to ensure the election can take place in these areas. And it is enjoying more success this year because it has learned from its past failures, and acquired new and deadly technology.\n\nIn particular, it has responded to the early advantage enjoyed by the opposition in the use of inexpensive drones, by buying thousands of its own drones from China, and training its forward units how to use them, to deadly effect.\n\nIt is also using slow and  easy-to-fly motorised paragliders , which can loiter over lightly-defended areas and drop bombs with high accuracy. And it has been bombing relentlessly with its Chinese and Russian supplied aircraft, causing much higher numbers of civilian casualties this year. At least a thousand are believed to have been killed this year, but the total is probably higher.\n\nOn the other side, the fragmented opposition movement has been hampered by inherent weaknesses.\n\nIt comprises hundreds of often poorly-armed \"people's defence forces\" or PDFs, formed by local villagers or by young activists who fled from the cities, but also seasoned fighters from the ethnic insurgent groups who have been waging war against the central government for decades.\n\nThey have their own agendas, harbouring a deep mistrust of the ethnic Burmese majority, and they do not recognise the authority of the National Unity Government which was formed from the administration ousted by the 2021 coup. So there is no central leadership of the movement.\n\nAnd now, more than four years into a civil war that has killed thousands and displaced millions, the tide is turning once again.\n\nWhen an alliance of three ethnic armies in Shan State launched their campaign against the military in October 2023 - calling it Operation 1027 - armed resistance to the coup had been going on in much of the country for more than two years, but making little progress.\n\nThat changed with Operation 1027. The three groups, calling themselves the Brotherhood Alliance - the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army - had prepared their attack for months, deploying large numbers of drones and heavy artillery.\n\nThey caught military bases off-guard, and within a few weeks had overrun around 180 of them, taking control of a large swathe of northern Shan State, and forcing thousands of soldiers to surrender.\n\nThese stunning victories were greeted by the broader opposition movement as a call to arms, and PDFs began attacks in their own areas, taking advantage of low military morale.\n\nAs the Brotherhood Alliance moved down Asian Highway 14, towards Myanmar's second-largest city of Mandalay, there was open speculation that the military regime might collapse.\n\nThat did not happen.\n\n\"Two things were overstated at the start of this conflict,\" says Morgan Michaels, a research fellow at the International Institute of Strategic Studies.\n\n\"The three Shan insurgent groups had a long history of working together. When other groups saw their success in 2023, they then synchronised their own offensives, but this was misread as some sort of unified, nationwide opposition steaming towards victory. The second misreading was how bad military morale was. It was bad, but not to the extent where command and control was breaking down.\"\n\nThe junta responded to its losses in late 2023 by starting a forced conscription drive. Thousands of young Burmese men chose to flee, going into hiding or exile overseas, or joining the resistance.\n\nBut more than 60,000 joined the army, replenishing its exhausted ranks. While inexperienced, they have made a difference. Insurgent sources have confirmed to the BBC that the new recruits are one of the factors, together with the drones and air strikes, which have turned the tide on the battlefield.\n\nDrones have given the junta a decisive advantage, reinforcing its supremacy in the air, according to Su Mon, a senior analyst at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), which specialises in gathering data on armed conflicts. She has been monitoring the military's use of drones.\n\n\"The resistance groups have been telling us that the almost constant drone attacks have killed many of their solders and forced them to retreat. Our data also shows that military air strikes have become more accurate, possibly because they are being guided by drones.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she says tighter border controls and China's ban on the export of dual-use products are making it harder for the resistance groups to get access to drones, or even the components to assemble their own drones.\n\nPrices have risen steeply. And the military has much better jamming technology now, so many of their drones are being intercepted.\n\nThe TNLA is not the only ethnic army which is retreating. In April, after strong Chinese pressure, another of the groups in the Brotherhood Alliance, the MNDAA, abandoned Lashio, previously the headquarters of the military in Shan State and a much-heralded prize when the insurgents captured it last year.\n\nThe MNDAA has now agreed to stop fighting the junta. And the most powerful and best-armed of the Shan insurgent groups, the UWSA, has also buckled to Chinese demands and agreed to stop supplying weapons and ammunition to other opposition groups in Myanmar.\n\nThese groups operate along the border and need regular access to China to function. All China needed to do was close border gates and detain a few of their leaders to get them to comply with its demands.\n\nFurther south, in Karen State, the junta has regained control of the road to its second most important crossing on the border with Thailand.\n\nThe insurgent Karen National Union, which overran army bases along the road a year and a half ago, blames the new conscripts, new drones and betrayal by other Karen militia groups for its losses. It has even lost Lay Kay Kaw, a new town built with Japanese funding in 2015 for the KNU, at a time when it was part of a ceasefire agreement with the central government.\n\nIn neighbouring Kayah, where a coalition of resistance groups has controlled most of the state for two years, the military has retaken the town of Demoso, and the town of Mobye, just inside Shan State. It is also advancing in Kachin State in the north, and in contested areas of Sagaing and Mandalay.\n\nHowever, there are many parts of Myanmar where the junta has been less successful. Armed resistance groups control most of Rakhine and Chin States, and are holding the military at bay, and even driving it back in places.\n\nOne factor in the military's recent victories is that it is concentrating its forces only in strategically important areas, Morgan Michaels believes, like the main trade routes, and towns where it would like to hold the election.\n\nTellingly Kyaukme and Hsipaw are both designated as places where voting is supposed to take place. The regime has acknowledged that voting will not be possible in 56 out of Myanmar's 330 townships; the opposition believes that number will be much higher.\n\nChina's influence over the ethnic armies on its border could have stopped them mounting the 1027 operation two years ago. That it chose not to is almost certainly down to its frustration then over the scam centres which had proliferated in areas controlled by clans allied to the junta. The Brotherhood Alliance made sure shutting down the scam centres was at the top of its list of goals.\n\nToday, though, China is giving its wholehearted backing to the junta. It is promising technical and financial aid for the election, and has given visible diplomatic support, arranging two meetings this year between the junta leader Min Aung Hlaing and Xi Jinping. This despite China's unease about the 2021 coup, and its hugely destructive consequences.\n\n\"China opposes chaos and war in Myanmar,\" said Foreign Minister Wang Yi in August, which more or less sums up its concerns.\n\n\"Beijing's policy is no state collapse,\" Mr Michaels says. \"It has no particular love for the military regime, but when it looked like it might teeter and fall, it equated that with state collapse, and stepped in.\"\n\nChina's interests in Myanmar are well-known. They share a long border. Myanmar is seen as China's gateway to the Indian Ocean, and to oil and gas supplies for south-western China. Many Chinese companies now have big investments there.\n\nAnd with no other diplomatic initiatives making any headway, China's choice, to bolster the military regime through this election, is likely to be endorsed by other countries in the region.\n\nBut even China will find it hard to end the war. The devastation and human suffering inflicted by the military on the people of Myanmar have left a legacy of grievances against the generals which may last generations.\n\n\"The military has burned down 110 or 120,000 houses just across the dry zone,\" Mr Michaels says.\n\n\"The violence has been immense, and there are few people who have not been touched by it. That's why it is difficult to foresee a political process right now. Being forced into ceasefire because you literally cannot hold your front lines is one thing, but political bargaining for peace still seems very distant.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/22/us/politics/east-wing-trump-ballroom.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"23:34:55-04:00","title":"The East Wing: Before and After","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has reversed his earlier promise of a light renovation, announcing the complete demolition of the East Wing of the White House to build a new ballroom.

2025-10-22T23:36:44.324+00:00\n\nTitle: Why India’s Gen Z is not taking to the streets\n\nIndia's Gen Z is vast, restless and hyper-connected - more than 370 million people under 25, nearly a quarter of the country's population.\n\nSmartphones and social media keep them constantly informed about politics, corruption, and inequality. Yet taking to the streets feels risky and remote: fear of being branded \"anti-national\", regional and caste divides, economic pressures, and a sense that their actions may have little impact all weigh heavily.\n\nElsewhere in  Asia  and Africa, the same cohort - Generation Z, those born roughly between 1997 and 2012 - has been anything but quiet recently.\n\nIn Nepal, young protesters brought down a government in just 48 hours last month; in Madagascar a youth-led movement toppled its leader; frustrated Indonesians, worried about jobs, forced concessions from the government after protests against rising living costs, corruption and inequality; and in Bangladesh, anger over job quotas and corruption brought regime change last year. Co-ordinated through encrypted apps and amplified by social media, these uprisings are fast-moving, decentralised and frustrated over political corruption and cronyism.\n\nIn India, there have been faint sparks of discontent. In September, the disputed Himalayan region of Ladakh saw  violent clashes  between police and protesters demanding statehood for the territory, prompting activist Sonam Wangchuk to describe the unrest as a sign of \"Gen Z's frenzy\" and long-suppressed anger.\n\nThis mood found an echo in national politics. Main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi's remark on X that \"Gen Z youth will  prevent voter fraud  and save the Constitution\" came after he publicly alleged large-scale electoral irregularities in the state of Karnataka.\n\nIn response to regional unrest, particularly the Nepal uprising, Delhi's police chief has  reportedly  instructed his force to draw up contingency plans for potential youth-led demonstrations in the capital.\n\nOnline, the debate is raging and deeply divided. Some users on Reddit and X have urged India's youth to stage similar protests at home. Others, recalling the violence in Nepal's upheaval, warn against romanticising leaderless revolts. Fact-checking outlet BoomLive describes an  \"online battle\"  within the generation itself: one side views the demonstrations as legitimate calls for justice; the other suspects foreign manipulation.\n\nFrom the  anti-Indira Gandhi protests  of the mid seventies to recent campus movements, India's student activism has captured attention. Yet experts remain sceptical that it could unseat the central government like in Nepal or Bangladesh.\n\nOne reason is that India's Gen Z is fragmented. Like their regional peers, many are disillusioned by joblessness, corruption and inequality. Yet their anger flares around local issues, making a unified national movement unlikely.\n\n\"I don't see a single force uniting us,\" says 26-year-old Vipul Kumar, a journalist from Bihar.\n\n\"Power in India is much more decentralised than in Nepal, and so is the anger of its youth. While I want our federal government to be challenged, many young people  just want more government jobs.\"\n\nThis is one of the reasons why Sudhanshu Kaushik of the Centre for Youth Policy believes India will remain an \"outlier\" when it comes to a Gen Z revolution.\n\n\"Age is not the only differentiator. In India young people are also strongly aligned with regional, linguistic, and caste identities, which often put them at odds with one another.\n\n\"If a Gen Z uprising occurs in India, would it be of the Dalit Gen Z, urban or Tamil-speaking? The truth is that there are far too diverse Gen Z communities with different intersecting interests,\" Mr Kaushik, a youth activist and author of a book on Indian youth, says.\n\nIn other words, this means that urban youth might rally around issues like job opportunities and city infrastructure; Dalit - once deemed untouchable by India's hierarchical caste system - youth around caste discrimination and social justice; and Tamil-speaking youth around language, regional rights or local traditions.\n\nAlso, the triggers vary. In Gujarat and Haryana states, young upper-caste communities have protested for increased affirmative action, while in Tamil Nadu, young people have taken to the streets against a court ruling  banning jallikattu , a traditional bull-taming sport.\n\nLayered on top of these divisions is another barrier. The fear of being branded \"anti-national,\" deters even the most aware and connected young people from taking to the streets, says Dhairya Choudhary, a 23-year-old political science graduate. In India, that label is often deployed by some politicians and television anchors to discredit dissent.\n\nIt doesn't help that some of the country's top universities - once vibrant hubs of political debate - now restrict or ban protests. \"These institutions, once centres of anti-government activism, have lost that spirit,\" says 23-year-old researcher Hajara Najeeb.\n\nRecognising that youth energy persists, the government claims to make India's youth a  policy priority , seeking to channel their energy through schemes and outreach. Yet economic pressures shape many of their life choices.\n\nAs Mr Kaushik notes: \"India is generally doing a little better than the world when it comes to the economy. That being said, unemployment anxiety continues to grow… young people are taking things into their own hands, with migration abroad increasing year after year.\"\n\nIndia's young are also not voting with much enthusiasm. Only 38% of the 18-year-olds registered themselves as voters for the 2024 elections. A new  survey  by a citizen media platform found trust in traditional politics waning: 29% of young Indians avoid it altogether.\n\nMr Kaushik notes that in recent decades, many young Indians have increasingly defined themselves through religious, cultural and linguistic identities.\n\nNot surprisingly a post-election survey by CSDS-Lokniti found the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retaining  strong youth backing , with 40% support in 2019 and only a marginal decline in 2024.\n\nTo be sure, the roots of India's Gen Z's political awareness run deeper, shaped by a decade of street movements they witnessed as teenagers.\n\nThe older among them watched, as teenagers, the massive street movements of the 2010s - from Anna Hazare's  anti-corruption protests  to the mass demonstrations over the 2012  Delhi gang-rape .\n\nLater, students led major campus and street protests in 2019, including against the  revocation of Kashmir's autonomy ,  farm reform laws , and most notably, the  controversial citizenship law . The protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), largely driven by the Gen Z, were among the most significant of them all - but not without costs\n\nIn 2019, student protests at Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University led to violent clashes after police stormed the campuses. Student leader  Umar Khalid  was arrested and remains in jail five years later, accused - but denying - his role as a \"key conspirator\" in the 2019 Delhi riots.\n\n\"The government has demonised protest to such an extent... few people even think of protesting,\" says Jatin Jha, a 26-year-old youth fellow with the State Bank of India. The government claims it was only protecting law and order while portraying the protests as influenced by outside forces or \"anti-national\" elements.\n\nThis muted engagement may also reflect a deeper generational trait: as sociologist Dipankar Gupta  notes , youth energy is fleeting, and each generation tends to forge its own causes rather than inherit old ones. Recent history shows a pattern: youth can topple regimes, but lasting change or improved prospects for young people can often remain elusive, from the Arab Spring to Bangladesh, or perhaps Nepal.\n\nFor now, India's Gen Z seem more watchful than rebellious - their dissent subdued, but their aspirations unmistakably clear."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx30vnwd4do","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"00:59:06.532+00:00","title":"US axes website for reporting human rights abuses by US-armed foreign forces","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. State Department has removed the Human Rights Reporting Gateway (HRG), the only public platform allowing individuals and organizations to report alleged human rights abuses by foreign military units receiving U.S. military aid.

portal for reporting alleged human rights violations by foreign military units supplied with American weapons.\n\nThe Human Rights Reporting Gateway (HRG) acted as a formal \"tip line\" to the US government.\n\nIt was the only publicly accessible channel of its kind for organisations or individuals to inform it directly of potentially serious abuses by US-armed foreign forces.\n\nIts deletion has been condemned by human rights campaigners and by a senior congressional aide who drafted the law requiring it. The State Department insisted it was still abiding by the law.\n\nThe portal was established in 2022 following pressure on successive administrations to abide by updated provisions of the Leahy Law, named after former US Senator Patrick Leahy. These require the government to \"facilitate receipt\" of information on alleged gross violations of human rights by military units supplied by Washington.\n\nAmong the cases submitted via the HRG was the alleged excessive use of force by security forces during anti-government protests in Colombia, while several cases were due to be submitted relating to US-armed units of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the occupied West Bank, according to Amnesty International.\n\nTim Rieser, former senior aide to Senator Leahy who wrote the 2011 amendment mandating information gathering, told the BBC the gateway's removal meant the State Department was \"clearly ignoring the law\".\n\nHe added it was a further sign that \"the entire human rights architecture\" within the department was being \"rendered largely ineffective\".\n\n\"The United States will find itself supporting foreign security forces that commit heinous crimes even though nothing is done about it,\" said Mr Rieser. \"As a result there will be less incentive for foreign governments to bring people who commit such crimes to justice.\"\n\nIn response, the US State Department insisted it was continuing to receive reports regarding gross violations of human rights and was engaging with \"credible organisations\" on a full spectrum of human rights concerns.  It said: \"The Department abides by its legal requirements\".\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has overseen a sweeping reorganisation of the State Department involving widespread layoffs and eliminating some offices focused on human rights monitoring. The department this year released a slimmed-down annual human rights report which critics said omitted alleged crimes by US allies but included those by foreign leaders the Trump administration opposes.\n\nThe department has previously said its restructure made it leaner and more efficient and followed President Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy which sees some human rights promotion as ideologically driven.\n\nCharles Blaha, former Director of the Office of Security and Human Rights at the State Department, said people in the field would now have \"no established channel\" for reporting gross violations of human rights by foreign security forces.\n\nThe government's ability to deter abuses was \"severely weakened\", said Mr Blaha who is now an adviser to the Washington-based think tank Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN).\n\nThe BBC learned during the summer that the HRG site was earmarked for deletion. Its removal was highlighted by DAWN in August but has not previously been acknowledged by the State Department. The BBC confirmed this week that officials phased out the reporting channel during the department's restructure.\n\nScreengrabs of the portal taken by the BBC before its deletion show it asked for information on US-armed foreign military units involved in alleged abuses including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture and rape. It required extensive details to ensure credible reporting including unit names, identities of alleged perpetrators, specific locations and dates.\n\nBlaha had already voiced frustration that despite the HRG passing its pilot phase, the Biden administration had not done enough to publicise it, meaning the provision to \"facilitate receipt\" of information was still not being fully honoured before the Trump administration deleted the channel entirely.\n\nThe US is the world's biggest contributor of military aid to foreign countries, supplying funding, equipment, training and arms to more than 150 nations. Its vetting procedures to prevent arms going to units involved in breaches of international law have evolved over the years, with the 1997 legislation named after Senator Leahy being one its major pillars.\n\nAt the heart of the law is Congress sending a message to the administration that taxpayer funding cannot support human rights abuses abroad, says Amanda Klasing, who oversees government relations at Amnesty International USA.\n\n\"If I'm a member of Congress, my perspective is: 'I want to protect my constituents and their taxpayer funding from going to torturers or people that kill their own citizens for protesting,\" she told the BBC.\n\nKlasing oversaw the compilation and submission of several reports to the Human Rights Reporting Gateway.\n\nThese included allegations that American arms were used by Colombian security forces during mass anti-government protests in 2021, in which at least 47 people were killed and many wounded according to the group. Amnesty says among the arms were US-supplied high-capacity launchers for stun and smoke grenades.\n\nKlasing says she had also gathered evidence relating to the killing of 20 Palestinians during IDF raids in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in October and November 2023.

ex-first lady, a tycoon and a 'safe pair of hands' vie for power\n\nDancing dominates campaign rallies in Ivory Coast but the pulsing energy and fervour belies concerns about the political landscape in the world's largest cocoa producer.\n\nSaturday's presidential vote in the West African nation is as notable for the candidates who have been banned from running as for those who are vying for the top job.\n\nWhile incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, a hero to some for bringing growth over the last 15 years to a country following a brutal civil war, is facing a backlash from those who see the 83-year-old's fourth-term bid as a slap in the face to democracy - even though his candidacy is allowed by the constitution.\n\nProminent opposition leader Tidjane Thiam was disqualified in April after a court  ruled that he had forfeited his Ivorian citizenship when he became French in 1987 - a ruling that he disputed - while former President Laurent Gbagbo was barred because of a 2018 criminal conviction.\n\nIt was Gbagbo's refusal to accept defeat to Ouattara in a run-off vote in 2010 that sparked a post-election conflict that left more than 3,000 people dead and traumatised a nation vital to the global supply of chocolate.\n\nYet Ouattara, known to his supporters by his initials \"Ado\", still faces strong competition, especially from Gbagbo's former wife, and one of the country's richest man, popular with urban voters - but it is a divided opposition.\n\nThere are four candidates up against the octogenarian:\n\nDespite the economic progress under Ouattara, his opponents hope to capitalise on complaints from many of the country's poor, who are not feeling the benefits of the rapid growth.\n\n\"The economy is growing, but not for us,\" Billon, the business tycoon and youngest of all the candidates - representing the Democratic Congress (Code) - has said.\n\nDancing on stage during rallies in front of thousands of supporters in the political capital, Yamoussoukro, he has taken to doing judo moves to show he is \"ready for the job and full of energy\".\n\n\"Young people can't find jobs, and the cost of living is rising,\" says the politician, who is confident that if he gets into a second-round run-off with the incumbent, then \"Ouattara's time will be over\".\n\nBillon had been hoping to represent the centre-right Democratic Party (PDCI) of late President Henri Konan Bédié.\n\nBut in the end the party went for the now-disqualified Thiam - so without a candidate on the ballot paper, Billon feels sure he will get the backing of PDCI supporters.\n\n‎However, Simone Gbagbo, leader of the leftist Movement of Capable Generations (MGC), has also positioned herself as a voice for the disaffected - and believes those votes will come to her.\n\nAlways smiling and wearing traditional smart dresses, her energy sparks and she holds her mic like a pop star. A natural campaigner, she knows how to revitalise her supporters.\n\nThe former first lady, once dubbed \"the iron lady\" because of her reputation for toughness, is part of the CPA-CI, a coalition of opposition groups that came together earlier this year to protest against Ouattara's candidacy.\n\n\"President Ouattara has done some good things, but he destroyed education,\" she told her supporters recently.\n\nWith a background in education, academia and trade unions, her campaign has focused on rebuilding schools and offering better opportunities to young people.\n\n‎Despite such criticism, Ouattara's backers remain confident. His rallies seem a little bit less dynamic than in 2010, 2015 and 2020 - but they still attract many people of all ages.\n\nThe popular hit Coup du marteau (Hammer Blow) by Ivorian rapper Tam Paiya and featuring Team Paiya has become the unofficial anthem for his RHDP party with former prime ministers, ministers, MPs and other influential backers often seen dancing to it with energy.\n\n\"The president is in good shape and ready to serve again,\" says government spokesman Adama Coulibaly, pointing to major public works and investor confidence as proof of the country's stability.\n\nBut despite the change to the constitution in 2016 that allowed Ouattara to run for a third and fourth term, his candidacy this time round has sparked anger and the government has reacted to recent protests with a swift crackdown.\n\nMore than 700 demonstrators were arrested earlier this month following an opposition march and 50 sentenced to three years in jail.\n\n‎There is some concern that this could be the prelude to further disorder in the aftermath of the vote.\n\nThe memory of past political violence remains vivid - and to avoid any unrest, the security forces have been deployed across major cities.\n\nNevertheless many residents are taking precautions.\n\n\"We're leaving Abidjan a week before the vote,\" Ahoua Diomande, a mother of two, told the BBC.\n\n\"Each election brings fighting and deaths.\"\n\n‎‎But there are optimists too, like Charm Matuba, an Abidjan resident who originally hails from Congo-Brazzaville and has been closing following the campaign even though she cannot vote.\n\n\"I know everything will go well. Ivorians don't want to die again for politicians,\" she said.\n\n\"I just hope people will go to vote. All my friends support Simone. She's a leader, a true source of inspiration. She can create the surprise.\"\n\n‎‎Regional loyalties are likely to play a large role in this election, as they have done in the past.\n\nOuattara enjoys strong support in the north, where his base among Dioula-speaking communities remains loyal - and he opted to launch his campaign in the west where he has previously picked up votes.\n\nSimone Gbagbo also draws much of her backing from the west - and from the south-west too, historic strongholds of her ex-husband's former party.\n\nBillon appeals to urban voters and the central regions, promising to modernise the economy and foster generational change.\n\n\"He represents the young generation,\" said Salifou Sanogo, who is 19. \"It will be my first time voting and seriously, I know he will win. Ouattara is too old, tired and didn't do anything for us. We need change, we need Billon.\"\n\nThe endorsement of the excluded candidates would be significant but neither Thiam nor former President Gbagbo has backed anyone else.\n\nHowever, Simone Gbagbo is supported by Charles Blé Goudé, once a close ally of her former husband and who has opted not to put his hat in the ring.\n\n\"Bring Simone to the palace,\" the charismatic politician told thousands of his Young Patriot COJEP party supporters at one recent rally.\n\nAlong with the economy, foreign relations have also become a campaign issue.\n\nIvory Coast has taken a hard line against the military juntas in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, which now form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) and have sought closer ties with Russia.\n\nThese regimes accuse Ouattara of siding with France, their former colonial power, and pursuing a \"secret agenda\" on its behalf - which his government denies, maintaining it supports democratic governance in the region.\n\nBut the rhetoric has sharpened tensions with its northern neighbours. Some opposition candidates, including Ahoua Don Mello, have suggested that Ivory Coast should be \"open to new partnerships\" with Russia and China, arguing that the country must diversify its alliances.\n\nHis message has resonated in parts of western Ivory Coast, where anti-French sentiment runs deep.\n\nWhen fake news alleging that Ouattara had died trended on social media last march, the Ivorian authorities believe it started from the AES countries.\n\n‎‎As the noise and excitement of campaigns draw to a close, President Ouattara's supporters insist that continuity is the key to preserving stability and economic progress.\n\nHis critics argue that another term could deepen frustration and erode trust in democratic institutions - something that has dangerous echoes of the past.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/trump-white-house-demolition.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:28:25-04:00","title":"The White House Wrecking Ball","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House East Wing is being demolished to make way for a $200 million private ballroom project proposed by President Donald Trump, sparking widespread criticism from historians, architects, and politicians over its violation of historic preservation norms.

perfect backdrop for a stroll to the White House to watch the swift demolition of the East Wing.\n\nI heard it before I saw it: the thrum of construction equipment and a loud rat-tat-tat that could have been digging or drilling. As I weaved through a group of schoolchildren posing for photographs in front of the main residence, I could see the arms of two excavators bobbing around, too tall to be hidden by the thick white fence erected around the fresh construction site. Behind them, a cloud of dust obscured the clear air.\n\nIt wasn’t so long ago that Trump was promising his plan to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the grounds “won’t interfere with the current building.” In fact, my colleague Luke Broadwater reported today that the entire wing, which is historically the domain of the first lady, will be razed in the project.\n\nImages of the demolition, which began on Monday as a precursor to the construction of a $200 million ballroom, have rocketed around the globe, swiftly becoming political fodder and a perfect Rorschach test for a deeply polarizing presidency.\n\n“This is Trump’s presidency in a single photo,” wrote Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, on X, above a picture showing roof tiles and windowpanes cascading from the facade of the wing, having fallen victim to the excavators’ jaws. “Illegal, destructive, and not helping you.”\n\nThe project has left historians and architects deeply alarmed. The National Trust for Historic Preservation on Wednesday urged officials to pause until it could go through the “legally required public review process.” Last week, Trump seemed to suggest to donors that “no approvals” were required for the project.\n\nTrump’s allies insist that the images show a president shaking up Washington, just like he promised. In a sign of awareness that they could not entirely ignore the criticism of the project, though, administration officials called the uproar “manufactured outrage” in a release that detailed other renovations on the building over the years.\n\n“He’s the builder-in-chief,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said brightly on Fox News on Tuesday. “In large part, he was re-elected back to this People’s House because he is good at building things.”\n\nTrump, ever the developer, has certainly spent a lot of time building things at the White House. He paved over the lawn in the Rose Garden to create a patio. He has added gold filigree to the Oval Office and ornate chandeliers to the Cabinet Room, remaking the White House with an indelible imprint of Mar-a-Lago maximalism that is all but certain to outlast his presidency.\n\n“Thank you for having us at your home,” John Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, told Trump on Tuesday, even though the White House does not actually belong to him, while thanking him “for everything you’re doing to make this such a beautiful place.”\n\nTrump is also, arguably, pretty good at tearing things down, like longstanding alliances — something the secretary general of NATO sought to bolster on Wednesday in Washington — or the guardrails intended to hem in his impulses as he seeks revenge on his enemies.\n\n“He seems to be upending all the norms that are associated with the presidency,” Matt Smith, a tourist from Lexington, N.C., observed this afternoon after riding up to the White House on a Lime scooter. Smith, an independent voter who did not back Trump, had hoped to spend his trip to Washington visiting Smithsonian art museums; with those museums closed by the government shutdown, he settled for this particular spectacle instead.\n\n“This is him physically doing it to us,” Smith said, “just to show that he can.”\n\nWhite House officials have repeatedly said that the ballroom will be paid for privately; Trump last week hosted a private dinner for donors who may see a donation to the project as a way to curry favor with the president.\n\nBut yesterday, one busted norm seemed to collide with another as Trump suggested that he might use funds from a settlement with his own government to pay for the ballroom.\n\nAfter my colleague Devlin Barrett reported that Trump is demanding the Justice Department pay him $230 million to compensate him for the federal investigations into him — a situation with no parallel in American history in which the officials reviewing Trump’s claims are his own allies — Trump said he might use those funds to pay for his ballroom.\n\n“If I get money from our country, I’ll do something nice with it, like give it to charity or give it to the White House while we restore the White House,” he said. “We’re doing a great job with the White House. As you know the ballroom is under construction.”\n\nThe source of such compensation would typically be taxpayer dollars.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, on how Congress has ceded its relevance as the government shutdown drags on and President Trump flexes his power. By almost any measure, writes our chief Washington correspondent, Carl Hulse, Congress is failing — and flailing.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nThat’s the margin in the New Jersey governor’s race, as polls tighten in the final stretch before Election Day. Ruth Igielnik, The Times’s polling editor, explains.\n\nMikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidate, now holds a slim lead in the race for governor of New Jersey, with 50 percent of likely voters saying they plan to support her while 45 percent say they support her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, according to the latest Fox News poll taken Oct. 10 to 14.\n\nThat is tighter than the race was just a month ago, when Sherrill held a more comfortable 8 percentage point lead. Democrats have won the last two governors’ races in the state as well as every presidential election there since 1988, but Republicans are hoping to telegraph strength with an off-year victory in the race.\n\nOf concern for Democrats, Ciattarelli has gained ground with independent voters and now has the edge with the group — 48 percent to 42 percent — in the latest Quinnipiac poll. That is a reversal from a month ago when Sherrill was up slightly with independent voters.\n\nONE LAST THING\n\nPresident Trump is dismantling climate policies and moving to shift the burden of natural disaster relief and recovery from the federal government to the states.\n\nBut a group of climate researchers found that the first six months of 2025 were the most expensive start to any year on record, in terms of disaster damage, according to a tally they began after the administration stopped updating the federal database that usually records weather disasters and their costs.\n\nMy colleague Scott Dance reported that this year’s weather catastrophes have already racked up more than $100 billion in damages, mostly stemming from the wildfires that spread through Los Angeles in January.\n\nRuth Igielnik, Taylor Robinson and Ama Sarpomaa contributed to this newsletter.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/east-wing-white-house.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"02:43:46.688Z","title":"From the Roosevelts to the Kennedys: A Look at the White House East Wing Trump Is Demolishing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The East Wing of the White House, a historic structure built in 1902 and rebuilt during Franklin D.

House, which will be torn down by this weekend to make way for President Trump’s new ballroom, has been a formal entryway, the site of social functions and a base for the first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt’s time.\n\nThe two-story wing, whose demolition has provoked outrage and alarmed historians and architects, was built under President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, when it was called the East Terrace, and then rebuilt during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency to conceal a new underground emergency bunker. It also housed additional White House staff and offices and provided an entrance for guests during events.\n\nThe East Wing also included the president’s theater, a covered walkway called the East Colonnade that connects to the main residence, and the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which sits just south of the colonnade. The garden, sometimes referred to as the East Garden or the First Lady’s Garden, served as a location for outdoor receptions.\n\nDirectly below the East Wing lies the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, a bombproof underground bunker for the president that was built during World War II at the same time as the modern East Wing. It was unclear whether the ballroom construction would affect the bunker.\n\nVice President Dick Cheney was hustled to the bunker after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Trump was rushed there, too, during protests in 2020.\n\nLorenzo Winslow, the White House architect in the 1930s, designed and oversaw the construction of the East Wing and the bunker, as well as other features of the modern-day White House, including the balcony and major interior reconstruction during Harry Truman’s presidency.\n\nThe East Wing’s wartime reconstruction was met with fierce backlash as Republicans called the expenditure wasteful, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nBut its utility quickly quelled criticism.\n\nBy the 1930s, Eleanor Roosevelt began employing more staff members as the first lady became a more public figure, using the East Wing for offices, official functions and news conferences.\n\nAs media attention on the first lady exploded during the Kennedy era, Jacqueline Kennedy expanded her East Wing operations to include a press secretary and other staff. An office formally dedicated to the first lady was planned under Betty Ford and opened under Rosalynn Carter in 1977, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nThe eastern part of the White House has been evolving since the structure’s earliest days.\n\nIn the early 1800s, President Thomas Jefferson added the East Colonnade along with a matching colonnade and terrace on both sides of the main residence to serve as connections to service buildings. The original East Terrace was removed in 1866 and rebuilt in 1902 to serve as the main entrance for social events.\n\nThis precursor to the modern East Wing included a coat room, gallery and a circular driveway for guests as they passed from carriages into the elegant corridor, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\n“Betty Ford had the best quote for how special the East Wing is: ‘If the West Wing is the mind of the nation, then the East Wing is the heart,” Anita McBride, who was chief of staff to Laura Bush when she was first lady, told East Wing Magazine. “The walls may be gone, but those East Wing stories must be preserved and shared for future generations.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/nyregion/eric-adams-cuomo-knicks.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"22:29:35-04:00","title":"Cuomo Joins Adams at Knicks Game.

Is an Endorsement in the Cards?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T22:29:35-04:00\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo walked off the mayoral debate stage Wednesday night and headed straight to Madison Square Garden, joining Mayor Eric Adams courtside in what felt like the prelude to an endorsement.\n\nThe New York Knicks were on their way to defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in their season opener, and Mr. Cuomo, who is trailing in the polls, seemed to be hoping for a campaign buzzer-beater.\n\nIt was a photo op clearly meant to send a message around the city. Mr. Cuomo, who is running for mayor as an independent, still trails Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, by double digits in the polls.\n\nAfter Mr. Adams, who had also been running for re-election as an independent, dropped out of the race last month, Mr. Cuomo gained nine points in one poll. He is eager to tap into the mayor’s dwindling reservoirs of support among Black voters and in the Orthodox Jewish community.\n\nMr. Mamdani and the Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, both said during the debate that they would not accept Mr. Adams’s endorsement if it was offered. Only Mr. Cuomo said he would.\n\nMr. Mamdani posted a picture of Mr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo at the game and wrote “corruption goes courtside.”\n\nMr. Adams has not backed a mayoral candidate so far, but he posted a photo of himself with Mr. Cuomo at the game, too, and seemed to be on the verge of offering an endorsement. “We need to win for the city,” the mayor wrote. “Can’t go backwards.”\n\nMr. Adams has been critical of Mr. Mamdani, calling his proposals to freeze rent on rent-stabilized apartments and to provide free buses fantasies.\n\nBefore he dropped out of the race, the mayor rarely had a kind word for Mr. Cuomo, but on Wednesday evening, the two seemed like best buddies.\n\nMr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo are bitter rivals with somewhat similar politics. Their platforms — pro-Israel, tough on crime and skeptical of the Democratic Socialist ideals that Mr. Mamdani embraces — often overlap.\n\nMr. Adams is 65. Mr. Cuomo, 67. In the early stages of the race, Mr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo looked locked in a generational fight with Mr. Mamdani, 34, a state assemblyman who has rocketed to stardom with pledges to make the city more affordable. Both have ripped into Mr. Mamdani and accused him of socialist and extremist ideas.\n\nMr. Adams’s own shot at a second term was derailed last year when he became the first sitting mayor in modern New York City history to be indicted. Federal prosecutors charged him with five counts of corruption, including bribery and soliciting illegal campaign donations. The charges were dropped after a recommendation from the Trump Justice Department.\n\nMr. Adams has called Mr. Mamdani a “snake-oil salesman” and denounced his membership in the Democratic Socialists of America and some of his policies, such as decriminalizing prostitution and supporting the closing of the Rikers Island jail complex.\n\nLast week, Mr. Adams told reporters he was having conversations about a potential endorsement of Mr. Cuomo.\n\n“Don’t let anyone fool you to believe this race is over,” Mr. Adams said during a recent interview on “The Reset Talk Show.” “Trust me, there’s a lot of time to determine who’s going to be the next mayor of the City of New York.”\n\nIt is unclear how much Mr. Adams’s endorsement would help Mr. Cuomo. Yvette Buckner, a Democratic political strategist, said that fewer than 10 percent of voters remained undecided, and Mr. Adams’s support was already diminished.\n\n“The window for movement is small,” Ms. Buckner said. “And there’s no clear indication that Adams’s supporters would automatically migrate to Cuomo, even with an endorsement from the mayor.”\n\nBefore both the debate and game began, Mr. Adams appeared on the Knicks’ pregame show and talked up the economic benefits of having a successful professional sports franchise based in New York City. Unprompted, he joked that he was endorsing the Knicks’ star guard Jalen Brunson for mayor.\n\n“Just how much they give back to our city,” Mr. Adams said. “They are just a great team. This is a dynasty that’s being built.”\n\nDuring his opening remarks in the debate, Mr. Cuomo mentioned the Knicks and said he hoped to get updates on the score.\n\nThe Mamdani campaign aired an advertisement on ESPN during its broadcast of the game. The spot cut between footage of New Yorkers playing basketball and Mr. Mamdani on the campaign trail.\n\nMr. Mamdani has been quick to talk up his sports allegiances on the trail, mentioning his love of soccer and appearing several times with a noted Knicks superfan, the film director Spike Lee, who endorsed him recently.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/trump-sanctions-russia-ukraine.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"19:43:10-04:00","title":"Trump Imposes Sanctions on Russian Oil Companies as His Frustration With Putin Mounts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, during his second term, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy toward Russia.

Putin after a plan for the two leaders to meet in Budapest fell apart.\n\nThe new sanctions were announced just as the president sat down in the Oval Office with NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, who had flown to Washington on behalf of a coalition of European leaders desperate to keep Mr. Trump on the side of Ukraine.\n\nThe sanctions targeted Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate cease-fire,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an announcement that described the oil companies as twin engines of “the Kremlin’s war machine.”\n\nMr. Trump’s irritation with the Russian leader was evident on Wednesday. “Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,” he said. “They just don’t go anywhere.”\n\nHe explained his decision to scupper the Budapest summit that had been planned for some time in the coming weeks. “It just it didn’t feel right to me,” Mr. Trump said. “It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it.”\n\nAs for the sanctions?\n\n“I just felt it was the right time,” he said.\n\nThe sanctions are among the most significant measures that the United States has taken against the Russian energy sector since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. The Biden administration avoided levying sanctions against the companies to allow for legal purchases of Russian oil by American allies; targeting the companies could make a meaningful dent in Russia’s oil revenues.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mayoral Candidates Trade Zingers in Final Debate\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T22:28:34-04:00\n\nInterruptions, insults and innuendo peppered the second and final debate of the New York City mayoral race on Wednesday.\n\nIn their last public exchange before Election Day, the race’s three highest-polling candidates attempted to undermine their opponents and score viral breakout moments. They often resorted to personal attacks and pushed one another to take positions on issues they had avoided addressing.\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is running as an independent, focused much of his criticism on the Democratic nominee and front-runner, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. Mr. Mamdani often responded by arguing that many of the city’s current problems could be traced to Mr. Cuomo’s governorship.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, worked as an equal-opportunity attacker, criticizing the other two candidates and frequently referring to them as “my adversaries.”\n\nThe live studio audience at LaGuardia Community College in Queens also gave the candidates more opportunities for applause lines. After they landed verbal blows against their opponents, they were frequently met with cheers or jeers, or both.\n\nThe exchanges grew so heated that at one point, the moderators had to interrupt the candidates to remind them of the rules, in an effort to curb the cross-talk. In the end, the debate ran five minutes over the allotted time.\n\nHere are the best zingers from the stage:\n\nThe moderators asked how the candidates would respond to the heightened presence of federal law enforcement in the city, prompting a back-and-forth over how they would work with President Trump. Mr. Cuomo aimed to position himself as the best candidate to stand up to the president. Mr. Mamdani, he said, would falter in the face of pressure from the White House, contending that Mr. Trump does not respect the 34-year-old assemblyman.\n\nMr. Mamdani responded to Mr. Cuomo’s assertion that Mr. Trump would steamroll him by painting the former governor as a tool of the president. He has often used this line of attack in an effort to undermine Mr. Cuomo in overwhelmingly Democratic New York City, where the president is unpopular.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s social media prowess has fueled much of his rapid political rise. And even as his opponents have sought to mimic the viral success of his snappy campaign videos, on the debate stage Wednesday night Mr. Cuomo ridiculed them. In response to a question about the candidates’ relationships to Jewish New Yorkers, the former governor tried to throw cold water on the assemblyman’s comments, suggesting that his rhetoric amounted to little more than internet fodder.\n\nMany of Mr. Sliwa’s attacks on Mr. Cuomo focused on the sexual assault allegations against the former governor, which led to his resignation in 2021. Mr. Cuomo has denied wrongdoing, and reiterated his denials several times on the debate stage. But after Mr. Cuomo referred to his having “left” the governor’s mansion when answering a question about homeless students, Mr. Sliwa jumped in to correct the record about his departure.\n\nThe candidates’ frustrations with one another surfaced again during a back-and-forth about the city’s mentally ill homeless residents and the need for more psychiatric beds. As Mr. Cuomo laid out his plan, Mr. Sliwa interrupted to claim that the former governor had cut portions of the state’s budget that could be used for mental health resources while in Albany. Mr. Cuomo responded by suggesting that if elected, he would set aside a space for Mr. Sliwa in a mental institution.\n\nThe sweeping renovation of LaGuardia Airport in Queens is one of the crown jewels of Mr. Cuomo’s record as governor. But during the debate, Mr. Mamdani criticized the expense of the project in light of the need to build housing for low-income New Yorkers. While responding to a question about homeless students, he mentioned the illuminated fountain, one of the flashier upgrades at the once-beleaguered airport, as an example of what he saw as the former governor’s misplaced policy priorities.\n\nMr. Sliwa, who has delivered rhyming political slogans throughout the campaign, launched a new one at Mr. Cuomo, whom he has called beholden to the city’s wealthy interests. He made the comment during an exchange about affordable housing initiatives, as he sought to portray himself as a better champion of working-class New Yorkers than the former governor.\n\nWhen the candidates were asked whether they would accept an endorsement from Mayor Eric Adams, Mr. Sliwa emphatically said no, suggesting that Mr. Adams has committed crimes. (The mayor was indicted last year on federal corruption charges, which were later abandoned by Mr. Trump’s Justice Department.)\n\nIn one of Mr. Mamdani’s final attacks on Mr. Cuomo, he sought to undercut the former governor’s claim that his extensive experience was his primary qualification. Mr. Mamdani argued that many New Yorkers were aware of the former governor’s track record, and in fact had been harmed by it. The assemblyman then invoked the nursing home residents who died during the Covid-19 pandemic, a direct attack line he used during the first debate.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/harvard-admissions-data-black-asian-latino-students.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"07:00:05-04:00","title":"Harvard Records an Increase in Asian Students and a Drop in Black Students","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Harvard’s first-year class in 2025 shows a significant decline in Black and Hispanic students — down to 11.5% and 11%, respectively — while Asian student enrollment rose to 41%, following the 2023 Supreme Court ban on affirmative action.

It was more evidence that a 2023 Supreme Court ban on affirmative action is having a significant effect on racial diversity at the nation’s elite schools.\n\nHarvard College said that 11.5 percent of its first-year students identify as Black this fall, down from 14 percent last year and 18 percent in 2023, before the Supreme Court ban took effect. While the decline is not as sharp as some experts had predicted, it reverses a trend toward increased racial diversity that had begun in the 1960s.\n\nThe numbers, released by Harvard College, showed an even sharper drop this year for Hispanic students — to 11 percent of this year’s first-year class from 16 percent last year. The percentage of Hispanic students had seen an increase last year from 2023, however.\n\nHarvard did not release figures for white students.\n\nThe racial breakdown of students at Harvard and other schools has been closely watched because of the role these schools play in providing access to power and influence in American society. In recent months, the Trump administration has also sought to force universities to report expanded admissions data that could be used to prove whether they are giving preferential treatment to applicants based on race.\n\nThe first year of data following the Supreme Court was confusing. Some institutions saw striking drops in Black students while at others, the number remained largely unchanged, defying predictions and prompting suggestions that some schools were ignoring the decision.\n\nThis year, however, the data is showing some clearer trend lines, according to James Murphy, director of postsecondary policy for Education Reform Now, a nonprofit group that supports expanding diversity and access to higher education.\n\n“African American enrollment has dropped significantly at almost all the highly selective institutions reporting this year,” said Mr. Murphy, who has been analyzing the data that other institutions have released. “Hispanic enrollment has declined at many of the institutions, but not all.”\n\nLast year, Princeton, for example, saw little change in the demographics of its first-year class. This fall, however, the school reported that Black enrollment in its first-year class had declined to 5 percent, the lowest number since 1968.\n\nLast year, 8.9 percent of Princeton’s first-year class was Black. Asian first-year students climbed to 27.1 percent of the class this year from 23.8 percent last year.\n\nMr. Murphy said that trends are less clear across schools for Asian and white students. At some schools their numbers are increasing, while at others they’ve stayed about the same. At Harvard, Asian enrollment increased to 41 percent of the first-year class from 37 percent last year, the same percentage as in 2023.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, the nonprofit organization that sued Harvard in the affirmative action case decided by the Supreme Court, had argued that the Ivy League college’s admissions policies discriminated against high-scoring Asian students by giving “boosts” to students from racial minority groups who scored lower on admissions tests.\n\nSignificantly, this was the first year since the pandemic that Harvard had required applicants to submit standardized test scores. As a result, Harvard said, its applicant numbers declined. But applicants were still 10 percent higher than before the pandemic, when testing requirements were suspended.\n\nThe 1,675 students in Harvard’s class of 2029 represent all 50 U.S. states and 92 countries, with international students making up 15 percent of the class, about the same as last year. This year, the Trump administration had tried to restrict Harvard’s ability to enroll international students, an effort that was blocked by a federal court in Massachusetts.\n\nTwenty-one percent of the students are low-income students eligible for federal Pell Grants, and 45 percent will attend Harvard tuition free under an expanded financial aid policy the college announced this year.\n\nHopi Hoekstra, dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said in a written statement released by the college that “even amid shifting economic realities, our commitment to access and opportunity remains unwavering.” Harvard declined to comment further on the admissions numbers.\n\nColleges have been slow this year in releasing demographic information about their first-year classes, with some wary of releasing the data because of increased pressure from the Trump administration, according to Mr. Murphy.\n\nSo far, fewer than 20 highly selective schools have released demographic data, according to a compilation by Mr. Murphy. Last year around this time, it was more than 30.\n\nSome schools that experienced declines in underserved minority students last year beefed up their recruitment this year in hopes of reversing or stemming the drop. In some cases, they had turned to data tools aimed at locating high-achieving students from low-income communities.\n\nBut the Trump administration said it would be on the lookout for the use of “hidden racial proxies” as it pushes a more expansive interpretation of the Supreme Court decision. One of the tools, called Landscape, which is sponsored by the College Board, was quietly shut down this year.\n\nThe data released so far helps clarify, but still does not complete the picture of the Supreme Court decision’s impact. There are differences in how universities report the data, for example, making it hard to compare changes from campus to campus.\n\nPrinceton, for example, reported a separate category of multiracial students — 7.7 percent of the class — while Harvard said that applicants who identified as two or more races were “reflected in the percentages for each of their respective identified races.”\n\nMany students also do not report their race at all. At Harvard this year, that number was 8 percent, the same as last year.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/world/europe/russia-trump-oil-sanctions.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:38:46-04:00","title":"Russians Awake to Trump’s New Oil Sanctions and Largely Shrug","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a reversal of a recent diplomatic effort, the United States has imposed new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies—Rosneft and Lukoil—marking one of the most direct economic attacks by President Trump against Russia in his second term.

It is the most direct punitive measure that Mr. Trump has taken against Russia in his second term, after electing not to follow through on a series of earlier threats.\n\nThe sanctions, which take aim at the heart of the Russian economy, dealt one of the biggest blows so far this year to Mr. Putin’s effort to cajole Mr. Trump into forcing Ukraine to capitulate to Russia’s main demands, including the concession of territory Ukraine still holds.\n\nBut analysts who study Mr. Putin said the new sanctions were unlikely to change the Russian president’s war goals. Russian companies have long been preparing for the possibility of increased sanctions, said Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the political analysis firm R.Politik. Mr. Putin remains willing to bear enormous losses to accomplish his aims, she said, and Mr. Trump may well change his mind again.\n\n“They’ll shrug their shoulders and say, ‘OK, he’ll ripen in three months,’” Ms. Stanovaya said of Russia’s reaction to Mr. Trump’s sanctions. “For Putin, this war remains existential, and he is ready to endure a lot.”\n\nOil prices rose sharply on Wednesday in a sign of the sanctions’ potential potency, which may ultimately depend on how the penalties are enforced and how energy buyers react to them. The new measures target Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, and anyone doing business with them around the world.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Frozen Russian Assets Into Cash for Ukraine\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T03:32:32-04:00\n\nThe European Union is racing to come up with a plan to keep money and weapons flowing to Ukraine at a moment when support from the United States is uncertain and Kyiv’s needs are gaping.\n\nMeeting in Brussels on Thursday, leaders from the bloc’s 27 member nations could move forward with a novel, risky idea that centers on Russia’s assets that have been frozen since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, has circulated a rough plan to use that immobilized money to back a 140 billion euro ($163 billion) loan to Ukraine. On Thursday, the political leaders will decide whether the commission should make a formal proposal to do so, though hammering out the final details and reaching agreement could take months.\n\n“We will take the political decision to ensure the financial needs of Ukraine for 2026 and 2027, including for acquisition of military equipment,” António Costa, the president of the European Council, predicted on Thursday morning, speaking on the sidelines of the meeting. The Council sets the political direction for the European Union.\n\nIf they decide to pursue the frozen assets plan, it would mark a first step toward making what European leaders call a “reparations loan” — a political greenlight for an idea that has big potential to help Ukraine as American aid dwindles.\n\nBut there are big risks: Russian retaliation and damage to Europe’s reputation as a safe haven for foreign assets.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\nA big chunk of the Russian government’s frozen assets sits in Euroclear, a financial institution in Belgium. Europe already funnels to Ukraine the interest earned on those deposits, about $8 billion last year.\n\nUnder the new plan, Euroclear would essentially hand control of Russia’s frozen funds to the European Union, which would use the money to back the giant loan to Ukraine. Ukraine would need to repay the money only if it received reparations from Russia.\n\nThe move is a political and financial gamble. One major question is how the Kremlin would react.\n\nThe European Union contends that the setup is legal because the money would be borrowed, not confiscated, so Russia could, at some point in the future, get it back. But a Kremlin spokesman said recently, “we are talking about theft,” and Russia warned that it could prosecute individuals and countries involved.\n\nAs the home of Euroclear, Belgium fears that it would bear the brunt of any legal or financial fallout, and has been adamant that the risks need to be shared across Europe.\n\nCritics of the plan have also warned that using Russia’s assets could make other nations, like China and India, nervous about stashing their savings in European banks, worried that their own assets could be frozen and lent out if they end up on Europe’s bad side.\n\nEuropean Commission officials say those fears are unfounded.\n\n“If you don’t start a war against another country, then your assets are not at risk,” Kaja Kallas, the top E.U. diplomat, told reporters on a recent trip to Kyiv, where she and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine discussed his country’s pressing budget needs.\n\nAs they downplay any risks, officials have also emphasized why they consider the plan necessary. As the war drags on, Ukraine faces not only huge ongoing costs but also a substantial budget deficit.\n\nA major problem is that American support has dried up. From 2022 to late 2024, under the Biden administration, Congress appropriated about $174 billion in funding for Ukraine. But under President Trump, U.S. military aid to Ukraine has fallen sharply this year, according to the Kiel Institute think tank, and in recent months has been all but nonexistent.\n\nEuropean nations have given heavily to Ukraine, but in light of their own budget constraints, it is difficult for them to fill the gap as America steps back.\n\nA loan backed by frozen Russian assets could theoretically make up the difference. But because key details have yet to be decided, it is not clear whether it will exactly match Ukraine’s needs or plug the holes left by the United States.\n\nIt has yet to be decided exactly how Ukraine would be able to use the loan.\n\nSome nations, most notably Germany, have suggested that the money should be dedicated to procuring weapons. But Mr. Zelensky himself has suggested that it should also be available for other budgetary needs.\n\nAnd other practical details remain unresolved.\n\nEuropean nations could provide loan guarantees to put Belgium at ease, but it is not clear how those guarantees would be structured. Would all 27 E.U. nations have skin in the game? Would the guarantees involve any actual collateral?\n\nBelgium wants the broader Group of 7 nations to also support the plan, but it is not clear whether Washington will agree.\n\nFinally, the E.U. executive must have a legal plan to ensure that the assets remain frozen for a long time. If the freeze needs to be renewed regularly, as is currently the case, a more Russia-friendly nation like Hungary could throw the loan into chaos by refusing to keep the funds immobilized.\n\nWith such substantial questions lingering, a decision on Thursday would only kick off the process. But given Ukraine’s looming needs, finding answers quickly will be a priority.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/texas-flood-radios-public-safety.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:00:24-04:00","title":"A Costly Radio System Faltered When Texas Needed It Most","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a deadly flash flood in Kerr County, Texas, emergency responders faced severe communication failures due to a new Motorola Solutions radio system that failed to provide reliable coverage, especially in critical areas like Camp Mystic.

County in central Texas this summer, rescuers combed dozens of miles along the Guadalupe River, looking for survivors. The grueling job was made more difficult because the radio system they needed to coordinate the response was not up to the task.\n\nSome rescuers got busy signals. Others got garbled messages. At Camp Mystic, the summer camp where 25 children died in the flooding, there was little to no coverage. Temporary radio towers eventually were brought in to extend service into the disaster zone.\n\nIt was a frustrating mix of problems, made even more troubling because Kerr County had just spent $7 million to overhaul its radio communication system. But the deficiencies were  no accident: The new network installed by Motorola Solutions excluded about a quarter of the county’s sprawling territory from reliable coverage for portable radios, leaving dead zones around Camp Mystic and other areas along the river.\n\nTo identify the system’s shortcomings, The New York Times digitized proposed coverage maps for Kerr County, reviewed contracting records and obtained data about the radio network’s performance through public records law. The Times found that a nonprofit public utility had also sought to bid on the project and had proposed  more extensive portable radio coverage that would have reached more than 90 percent of the county’s territory, including the Camp Mystic area.\n\nThat alternative system proposed by the utility, the Lower Colorado River Authority, would also have offered more capacity. And it could have been cheaper. But Motorola won the contract anyway, aided by a process that was tilted in the company’s favor.\n\nA Times analysis of the two proposals found that Motorola would provide reliable portable radio coverage for about 75 percent of the county, compared to more than 90 percent for L.C.R.A.\n\nCAMP MYSTIC\n\nL.

Coverage areas reflect where reliable portable radio coverage is expected.\n\nSource: Projected radio coverage areas provided by L.C.R.A. and Motorola.\n\nThomas Gilbert, a radio system manager who was brought in by the state to help coordinate communications, said a combination of coverage shortfalls and compatibility problems proved frustrating for responders who were struggling to find victims of the flooding. Some searchers had to hike out of the search areas to communicate when they found themselves upriver with little or no radio coverage.\n\n“That was a huge gap,” Mr. Gilbert said in an interview.\n\nThe communications challenges raise questions not just about Kerr County’s new radio system, but also about the broader role played by Motorola Solutions, a company that dominates the emergency communications business in the United States, generating large profits from taxpayer-funded projects.\n\nLike other competitors that have gone up against the radio powerhouse in recent years, the public utility that proposed the alternative radio system complained that the county’s bidding process was not a level playing field. The utility ultimately dropped out, leaving Motorola as the only formal bidder.\n\nIt was a familiar scenario for Motorola, which has won a series of high-profile contracts in recent years when there were no other bidders. Local governments lament that along the way, list prices for individual radios have risen, from as much as $8,000 a decade ago to more than $12,000 today.\n\nMotorola has pointed to problems in Texas, saying that while the state has made “great strides” to improve its emergency radio networks, it can be tough for any radio network to operate there without hitches.\n\n“The vast geography can make it difficult to establish and maintain communication systems that provide full coverage and interoperability,” Lauren Kirkland, a Motorola vice president, said at a legislative hearing in Austin last year.\n\nMotorola, which declined to answer questions about the Kerr County contract, has said that the rising prices for its equipment reflect the sophisticated technology and durability of their latest offerings, which look like a cross between traditional police radios, with knobs on top, and modern touch-screen cellphones. Still, the trend of higher prices and few suppliers has posed a nationwide challenge for public safety departments, whose hefty budgets in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks lured private equity and other investors into the supply chain.\n\nThe Times reported earlier this year about soaring prices for fire engines, as Wall Street consolidated the industry. Members of Congress are investigating.\n\nWhen he was called before state lawmakers to discuss the July floods, Sheriff Larry Leitha of Kerr County acknowledged problems with search crews from other jurisdictions being unable to use the county system, creating problems with  interoperability. And he said “I still have concerns” about the limited extent of radio coverage in the western part of the county.\n\nCounty officials have not explained why they did not require broader coverage in that area, including around Camp Mystic, when they were soliciting proposals for the radio system. Despite the shortcomings, they said they were nonetheless happy with its performance.\n\n“The new system worked very, very well,” said Jeffrey Wendling, who led efforts at the sheriff’s department to implement the Motorola system. He said some communications channels were overloaded during the floods, but that it resulted in only “momentary” busy signals for emergency crews.\n\nL. C. R.

Projected radio coverage areas provided by L.C.R.A. and Motorola.\n\nA Times analysis of radio logs released under public records law showed that the system was extensively strained.  At one point on July 7, three days after the flood, one responder every 45 seconds was receiving a busy signal when they tried to get a message through. Some users had to wait more than 20 seconds to convey their message to dispatchers.\n\nSome communications breakdowns stemmed from government failures. At a hearing after the flooding, Nim Kidd, Texas’s top emergency management official, said that some San Antonio firefighters who traveled to Kerr County to provide assistance had left their own Motorola radios back home; the radios would have needed reprogramming to work in Kerr County. Instead, he said, they used “cheap Chinese radios” that were provided by an emergency task force, and those radios did not work well. “We can do better than that, and we need to,” Mr. Kidd said.\n\nOver the last two decades, there has been a nationwide push to install interoperable communications systems, spurred by the inability of emergency workers to talk to one another while responding to the Sept. 11 attacks and after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMotorola Solutions was perfectly positioned for this transition. In 2011, the company broke away from the Motorola cellphone brand to focus on emergency land mobile radio communications.\n\nThe company now has 70 to 80 percent of the market, according to financial analysts, and has expanded its offerings for emergency responders to include body-worn cameras, police drones and 911 call-center software. Motorola Solutions’ stock price has surged in the past five years, outperforming Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.\n\n“Growing is not good enough,” Greg Brown, the company’s longtime chief executive, said last year on an earnings call. “You’ve got to grow top line, you’ve got to grow margins, you’ve got to grow operating cash flow and you’ve got to take share.”\n\nIn recent years, stock of Motorola Solutions has outperformed other Wall Street tech companies.\n\nMotorola Solutions\n\nstock price\n\nMotorola Solutions\n\nstock price\n\nSource: LSEG Data & Analytics.\n\nKarl Russell/The New York Times\n\nThe company hired influential lobbyists, including a former Mississippi governor, Haley Barbour, and more recently Reed Clay, a former top aide to Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas.\n\nIt made headlines for lucrative no-bid contracts in places like North Carolina, Florida, California and Texas. Local leaders there were reluctant to try lesser-known vendors, or sometimes raced to sign deals after Motorola warned that its prices would increase if contracts weren’t locked in quickly.\n\nThe F.B.I. backtracked on a $500 million no-bid contract with Motorola in 2014 after rival suppliers sought an open competition. In June 2023, some county supervisors in Kern County, Calif., complained that they had been given little time to read a $170 million Motorola contract that ran to roughly 6,000 pages; one competitor claimed that it violated county procurement policies. This year, Ocala, Fla., signed a $5.95 million Motorola contract even though another company had submitted a bid at about half that price.\n\nAnd the prices keep going up. Mr. Brown told analysts in 2022 that the company’s backlog of orders was growing even though it had imposed “multiple price increases,” which he said “speaks to the criticality of what we do and the ability for our customers to absorb that.”\n\nMr. Gilbert said that a six-channel Motorola radio site could be put on the air seven years ago for $300,000, but now costs about $500,000.\n\n“Most of us shake our heads at their pricing,” he said. “It’s like, ‘Good grief, this stuff is expensive.’”\n\nKeith Housum of Northcoast Research, a longtime industry analyst, said that governments were wary of trying lesser-known competitors.\n\n“No police chief or fire captain wants to put their officers at risk,” he said.\n\nEven so, Motorola’s leadership in the market puts it in a delicate position.\n\n“They want to slide below the radar screen as much as possible,” Mr. Housum said. Motorola executives, he said, “don’t want to talk about market share because they don’t want a bull’s-eye on their back and people saying they are a monopoly.”\n\nIn Kerr County, records show, Motorola representatives promoted their bid by noting that the company had built the emergency radio networks for 48 of the 50 largest municipalities in the United States.\n\nThe company’s operating profits soared to a record 24.8 percent of sales last year, having grown steadily from 10.5 percent in 2011.\n\nWalt Magnussen, one of the country’s foremost experts on public safety communications, said Motorola had succeeded because it made a good product. But he noted that emergency responders in Europe are often shocked at the prices for radios in the United States.\n\nIn 2023, British regulators found that Motorola, which runs the country’s emergency communications systems, was overcharging Britain by roughly $250 million annually, and said the company was using a “virtually unconstrained monopoly position” to reap “supernormal profits.” The company argued that the government’s “failed procurement process” was to blame. The regulators imposed a price cap.\n\nNobody has benefited from the company’s expansive growth more than Mr. Brown, who has become a billionaire in nearly 15 years at the helm; Mr. Brown hired Elton John to  perform at his wife’s birthday party on Cape Cod last year, an event that was also attended by Tom Brady, the former N.F.L. quarterback.\n\nTo Motorola, the federal relief money that gushed during the coronavirus pandemic was a major opportunity. In a May 2021 call with Wall Street analysts, Jack Molloy, the company’s chief operating officer, described it as the best funding environment he had ever seen.\n\n“You give salespeople a path to money, good salespeople, and they go find it,” he said.\n\nKerr County commissioners accepted $10 million in relief money. Though in past years they had discussed plans to invest in a flood warning system, they decided to instead use much of the relief money to upgrade the county’s radio system.\n\nBrien Alexander, who leads the Kerr Area Rural Fire Association, said the county’s old system, manufactured by Motorola, was growing obsolete, and that Motorola no longer made parts to repair the equipment.\n\nMotorola submitted a proposal, but it was not the only one on the table. Another came from L.C.R.A, , which already operated a network of radio tower sites in Texas. The two competitors offered plans with varying mixes of infrastructure improvements, leases and service costs. The Times examined the proposals and found that over a 10-year period, the cost of Motorola’s plan was on track to exceed that of the authority’s plan by more than $500,000.\n\nMotorola proposed using four towers to carry radio traffic around the county. The river authority proposed using 10, including some that were already in place for other customers.\n\nThe Times digitized the coverage maps provided during the process, and found that Motorola’s proposal, as measured there, would provide reliable portable radio coverage for about three quarters of the county, compared with more than 90 percent for the river authority.\n\nThe authority’s proposed coverage could have provided more reliable communications around the community of Hunt and through the county’s river valleys, like that of the South Fork of the Guadalupe River, where Camp Mystic is located.\n\nThe river authority’s planned system would sustain up to eight simultaneous conversations. Motorola’s would offer up to three.\n\nMr. Gilbert, who helped manage radio communications during the flood, said that for the systems that he works on, he generally views six simultaneous talk paths as the minimum needed to avoid overloading during a crisis.\n\nMotorola already had a possible advantage in the bidding process. A week before the company’s presentation to the commissioners in April 2022, the county had brought in Mr. Wendling for advice. Mr. Wendling, the director of special projects for the Kerr County Sheriff’s Office, also co-chaired an “interoperable communications” committee set up by the Alamo Area Council of Governments.\n\nMr. Wendling told the Kerr County commissioners that “all of us in our committee” believed the best option for the county was to use a VHF network — a range of radio frequencies used by Motorola but not by the river authority. The authority, which has a nonvoting representative on the committee, said in a statement last week that it was aware of no such committee discussion, and did not agree that VHF was the best choice for the county.\n\nMr. Wendling did not disclose during his meeting with the Kerr County commissioners that a senior project manager for Motorola, Robert Adelman, was the committee’s co-chairman.\n\nMr. Wendling and Motorola said that VHF channels were more effective in the hilly terrain found throughout Kerr County. But experts interviewed by The Times said that many variables — such as the number of towers — affect what type of radio system would perform best in a given area. “There is no general rule of thumb on what is the best way to go,” Mr. Magnussen said.\n\nThe county then imposed another contract requirement. It said that bidders would have to guarantee that equipment purchased in future years would not rise in price more than the rate of inflation. The river authority responded that only a  manufacturer could make such a guarantee, and it complained that this tilted the bid requirements in Motorola’s favor.\n\nIn correspondence with Kerr County, authority officials expressed concern that the county’s radio specifications appeared to “be designed to favor a particular manufacturer.” They said it was “remarkable” that the committee advising the county on the contract would be co-chaired by  an employee of one of the bidders, and called the arrangement  “a clear conflict of interest.”\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Adelman said that the river authority officials were “just being sore losers,” and that Motorola’s success in numerous contracts was based on its offering a “superior product.” He rejected accusations that his role represented a conflict, saying that while he works on public safety technology for Motorola, he was not directly involved with land mobile radio products, and thus did not need to recuse himself.\n\n“I can’t help who I work for,” he said. “I do everything I can to keep a wall up, to ensure that I can say without a doubt that I don’t believe there is a conflict of interest.”\n\nIn the end, the river authority offered an alternative proposal that did not fully address all of the county’s requirements, and the county said it could not consider it a viable bid.\n\nAs 2022 wound down, the county raced to sign a deal with Motorola.\n\n“Can somebody explain why there’s a rush to get this done before the end of the year?” one commissioner asked during a public meeting on Dec. 27. A Motorola salesman replied that price increases were coming.  Judge Rob Kelly, the county’s top elected official, said this meant that more than $600,000 was on the line.,“That’s a savings I want to get,” he said. The commissioners immediately approved the deal.\n\nMotorola’s system had been up and running for several months when the July 4 weekend deluge arrived, sending a rush of water down the Guadalupe River in the middle of the night.\n\nAs the scope of the disaster became clear, crews from across the region rushed in to help.\n\nMr. Gilbert arrived two days after the floods. At the emergency operations center, he immediately found crews who were aggravated by persistent radio problems. Kerr County’s system was so new that other agencies had not yet entered the county’s network protocols into their own radios. Mr. Gilbert said he set up an assembly line for programmers to update the radios of workers arriving from other jurisdictions.\n\nThen, as Mr. Gilbert began driving along the river to some of the areas of heaviest flooding, he found different problems. In upriver regions, responders from outside the county who came in with radios that were programmed to work on the river authority’s existing networks could communicate, but others, including those trained to use Kerr County’s new Motorola system, could not.\n\nMr. Gilbert brought in two mobile towers to help provide service in the upriver areas where communications were most difficult. One was placed in Hunt, where the river authority had planned to build a tower but Motorola had not. The other was placed on a hill at Camp Mystic. Coverage improved immediately.\n\n“It was night and day,” Mr. Gilbert said, adding that the two mobile towers handled some 8,000 radio calls over the following days.\n\nThe river authority declined to comment for this article on its contract proposal, beyond its public communications with the county. It is not clear whether the authority’s proposed network, with more towers, would have solved all the problems that the county experienced during the floods.\n\nThe temporary radio towers erected during the flood have since been removed. Mr. Wendling acknowledged that a new permanent tower might be needed to improve coverage. “There’s all kinds of things for everybody to learn,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/world/middleeast/rubio-israel-gaza.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:21:41-04:00","title":"Rubio Says U.S. May Seek United Nations Mandate for Gaza Security Force","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the Trump administration is considering seeking a United Nations mandate for a temporary international security force in Gaza, aimed at securing areas vacated by Israeli troops, preventing weapon shipments, and training a Palestinian police force.

The idea was for that force to secure the areas where Israeli troops have withdrawn, prevent munitions from entering the territory, facilitate the distribution of aid and train a Palestinian police force.\n\nBut several countries have been skittish about the idea of contributing troops to such a force because its exact mission in the devastated Palestinian enclave is unclear, and because of concerns that it might bring troops into direct conflict with Hamas fighters.\n\nMr. Rubio said that “going to the U.N. potentially and getting the international mandate” was a step toward “building the international defense security forces.”\n\nHe was expected to land in Israel shortly after Vice President JD Vance leaves the country — back-to-back visits by top U.S. officials that underscore the administration’s keen interest in preserving the cease-fire. Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, have also been in Israel this week.\n\nMr. Trump visited the country earlier this month to celebrate the cease-fire agreement. But several Trump administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, have recently said there was concern within the administration that Mr. Netanyahu might vacate the deal.\n\nBefore departing for Israel, Mr. Rubio also said that American diplomats will soon be assigned to monitor the fragile cease-fire at a new civil-military coordination center in southern Israel.\n\n“There’s a lot of work to be done,” said Mr. Rubio. “But we certainly wanted to make sure that we were there and ensuring that we had the right people in place at the coordination center, which is key to holding this all together.”\n\nMr. Vance, who visited that coordination center earlier this week, said the administration knew that it was “not going to be easy” to secure a lasting peace.\n\nSeveral thorny issues have yet to be addressed — including a stipulation in the president’s 20-point peace proposal that calls for the disarming of Hamas, which the militant group has long opposed.\n\nThe cease-fire agreement that went into effect earlier this month led to an Israeli military pullback within Gaza, and saw the last 20 Israeli hostages held in the enclave exchanged for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n\nIt faced fresh challenges this week from Israeli lawmakers, who approved a preliminary measure for the annexation of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a move that is explicitly prohibited under the terms of Mr. Trump’s peace plan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Rubio said he did not support Israeli annexation of the territory and called the measure “potentially threatening to the peace deal.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/22/climate/china-us-nuclear-energy-race.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"22:00:01-04:00","title":"How China Raced Ahead of the U.S. on Nuclear Power","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China is rapidly surpassing the United States in nuclear power capacity and construction efficiency, with nearly as many reactors under construction as the rest of the world combined.

two new U.S. nuclear reactors in a generation. Atomic energy was back. Or was it?\n\nSeven years late and $17 billion over budget, the reactors became two of the costliest ever built. Once again, nuclear power seemed hopeless, at least in the U.S.\n\nYet over the same period, China built 13 similar reactors, with 33 more underway. And Beijing’s nuclear ambitions are global.\n\nChina is quickly becoming the global leader in nuclear power, with nearly as many reactors under construction as the rest of the world combined. While its dominance of solar panels and electric vehicles is well known, China is also building nuclear plants at an extraordinary pace. By 2030, China’s nuclear capacity is set to surpass that of the United States, the first country to split atoms to make electricity.\n\nMany of China’s reactors are derived from American and French designs, yet China has overcome the construction delays and cost overruns that have bogged down Western efforts to expand nuclear power.\n\nAt the same time, China is pushing the envelope, making breakthroughs in next-generation nuclear technologies that have eluded the West. The country is also investing heavily in fusion, a potentially limitless source of clean power if anyone can figure out how to tame it.\n\nBeijing’s ultimate objective is to become a supplier of nuclear power to the world, joining the rare few nations — including the United States, Russia, France and South Korea — that can design and export some of the most sophisticated machines ever invented.\n\nA dome being placed on the Unit 1 reactor building of the Zhejiang San’ao nuclear power plant on Zhejiang Province, China, in 2022.\n\n“The Chinese are moving very, very fast,” said Mark Hibbs, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace who has written a book on China’s nuclear program. “They are very keen to show the world that their program is unstoppable.”\n\nAs the United States and China compete for global supremacy, energy has become a geopolitical battleground. The United States, particularly under President Trump, has positioned itself as the leading supplier of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. China, by contrast, dominates the manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, seeing renewable power as the multi-trillion-dollar market of the future.\n\nNuclear power is enjoying a resurgence of global interest, especially as concerns about climate change mount. That’s because nuclear reactors don’t spew planet-warming emissions, unlike coal and gas plants, and can produce electricity around the clock, unlike wind and solar power.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to quadruple U.S. nuclear power capacity by 2050, even as it ignores global warming, and it hopes to develop a new generation of reactor technology to power data centers at home and sell to energy-hungry countries overseas. Officials fear that if China dominates the nuclear export market, it could expand its global influence, since building nuclear plants abroad creates deep, decades-long relationships between countries.\n\nYet in the race for atomic energy, China has one clear advantage: It has figured out how to produce reactors relatively quickly and cheaply. The country now assembles reactors in just five to six years, twice as fast as Western nations.\n\nWhile U.S. nuclear construction costs skyrocketed after the 1960s, they fell by half in China during the 2000s and have since stabilized, according to data published recently in Nature. (The only two U.S. reactors built this century, at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Waynesboro, Ga., took 11 years and cost $35 billion.)\n\nNote: Reactors are placed according to the date they entered or are expected to enter commercial operation. Chart shows inflation-adjusted overnight costs, which exclude interest payments. Trend lines show linear regression slope.\n\n“When we first got this data and saw that declining trend in China, it surprised me,” said Shangwei Liu, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who led the paper.\n\nThe big questions, Mr. Liu said, are how China got so good at nuclear power — and whether the United States can catch up.\n\nA modern nuclear power plant is one of the most complex construction projects on Earth.\n\nThe reactor vessel, where atoms are split, is made of specialized steel up to 10 inches thick that must withstand bombardment by radiation for decades. That vessel, in turn, is housed in a massive containment dome, often three stories high and about as wide as the U.S. Capitol dome, made of steel-reinforced concrete to prevent dangerous leaks. Thousands of miles of piping and wiring must meet exacting safety standards.\n\nFinancing these multibillion-dollar projects is staggeringly difficult. Even minor problems, like needing regulator approval to modify a component midway through, can lead to long delays and can cause borrowing costs to skyrocket.\n\nConstruction on a transmission tower of the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant in Jiangsu Province in 2023.\n\nIt starts with heavy government support. Three state-owned nuclear developers receive cheap government-backed loans to build new reactors, which is valuable since financing can be one-third of costs. The Chinese government also requires electric grid operators to buy some of the power from nuclear plants at favorable rates.\n\nJust as importantly, China’s nuclear companies build only a handful of reactor types and they do it over and over again.\n\nThat allows developers to perfect the construction process and is “essential for scaling efficiently,” said Joy Jiang, an energy innovation analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, a pro-nuclear research organization. “It means you can streamline licensing and simplify your supply chain.”\n\nThe fact that the Chinese government has a national mandate to expand nuclear power means that companies can confidently invest in domestic factories and a dedicated engineering work force. In a sprawling complex near Shanghai, giant reactor pressure vessels are being continuously forged, ready to be shipped to new projects without delay. Teams of specialized welders move seamlessly from one construction site to the next.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, U.S. nuclear construction slowed to a trickle as interest rates rose and regulators frequently tightened safety rules, causing delays. Worries about the disposal of nuclear waste and fears after the 1979 partial meltdown of a reactor at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania, didn’t help. At the same time, private developers kept experimenting with new reactor designs that required different components and introduced fresh complications. U.S. nuclear power died from a lack of predictability.\n\nDemonstrators at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979.\n\nThe contrast became glaring in the late 2000s, when U.S. utilities tried to revive nuclear power with a new reactor model called the AP1000, with improved safety features. Developers struggled with the novel technology, leading to repeated delays and soaring costs. By the time the two reactors in Georgia were finished last year, most utilities were hesitant to try again.\n\nAs it happened, China built AP1000s at the same time. It, too, faced severe challenges, such as difficulties in obtaining coolant pumps and unpredictable cost spikes. But instead of giving up, Chinese officials studied what went wrong and concluded they needed to tweak the design and develop domestic supply chains.\n\n“What the Chinese did was really smart,” said James Krellenstein, the chief executive of Alva Energy, a nuclear consultancy. “They said, we’re going to pause for a few years and incorporate every lesson learned.”\n\nChina is now building nine more copies of that reactor, known as the CAP1000, all on pace to be completed within five years at a drastically lower cost, an Energy Department report found.\n\nSatellite image from Feb. 15, 2025. Source: Airbus DS via Google\n\nNuclear proponents in the United States sometimes argue that overly strict safety regulations drive up costs.\n\nChina’s safety requirements are similar. But in China the approval process is more predictable, and opponents have fewer ways to challenge a project. Most reactors in China break ground weeks after receiving final approval from the safety regulator, according to research by Ms. Jiang. In the United States, by contrast, projects often need additional permits from state governments that can take months or years.\n\n“China is practiced at building really big things, everything from dams to highways to high speed rail, and those project management skills are transferable,” said David Fishman, a power sector consultant at Lantau Group, a consulting firm.\n\nAs China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, seeks to curb pollution, it is counting on nuclear power to play an important role.\n\nSolar and wind power are growing fast and account for most of China’s clean electricity, but the country also burns enormous amounts of coal to supply power when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. More nuclear power could help backstop renewables and displace coal.\n\nNote: “Clean” includes low-carbon sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectricity and bioenergy. “Fossil fuels” includes coal, natural gas, and oil.\n\nChina’s nuclear expansion still faces hurdles. One of China’s plants suffered a smaller radioactive leak in 2021, and a bigger accident could trigger a public backlash. The country is still figuring out where to bury its nuclear waste, and some cities have seen impassioned protests over plans for waste reprocessing plants. Beijing has also blocked new reactors in much of China’s interior over concerns about their water use. If that moratorium persists, it could limit the industry’s growth.\n\nFor now, though, the country is barreling ahead, with plans to build hundreds of reactors by midcentury.\n\nIn the United States, nuclear power is one of the rare types of energy that has support from Republican and Democratic politicians alike, especially as demand for electricity rises. Even environmentalists like Al Gore who once fretted about catastrophic accidents and radioactive waste are warming to the technology.\n\nYet the U.S. is pursuing a starkly different path to nuclear expansion, one that leans more heavily on private innovation than government backing.\n\nDozens of start-ups are working on a new generation of smaller reactors meant to be cheaper than the hulking plants of old. Tech companies like Google, Amazon and OpenAI are pouring billions into nuclear start-ups like Kairos Power, X-Energy and Oklo to help power their data centers for artificial intelligence. Early projects are underway in Wyoming, Texas and Tennessee, though few, if any, new reactors are expected before the 2030s.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to accelerate this work by reducing regulations at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which certifies the safety of reactors before they are built. The agency’s critics say it has become too hidebound to handle advanced reactors that are less prone to meltdowns.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright speaking during the 69th annual International Atomic Energy Agency meeting in Vienna last month.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright said that the administration is betting that the private capital flowing into nuclear projects will spark American ingenuity and catapult the U.S. ahead of China. “Entrepreneurial capitalist competition is where the U.S. thrives, and I think it’s an advantage over China,” he said in an interview.\n\nYet some worry that the United States is betting too heavily on technological breakthroughs instead of focusing on the financing, skills and infrastructure needed to build plants, as China has. The U.S., for instance, has lost almost all of its heavy forging capacity to make large reactor components. A new generation of advanced reactors could also take years to perfect, leaving America behind.\n\n“You look at the number of designs, particularly in the U.S., you think, Oh, God, help us,” said Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “I would think narrowing down is the sensible thing to do.”\n\nWhile the Trump administration has moved to speed up nuclear permitting and increase domestic supplies of nuclear fuel, some important government tools for advancing new reactors, such as the Energy Department’s loan office, have been hampered by staffing cuts. Efforts to slash safety regulations could be contentious. There is also a risk that interest by tech giants could fizzle if the A.I. boom slows.\n\n“There’s no reason the United States couldn’t expand nuclear power,” said Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “But are we just going to see a few small reactors power a few data centers, or are we going to see a serious whole government approach to bring back nuclear power as an essential source of electricity?”\n\nA core module of a ACP100 multi-purpose, small modular pressurized water reactor — also called the Linglong One — a new nuclear power prototype rolling out facility in Liaoning Province in 2023.\n\nChina’s fast-paced nuclear program is a prelude to a larger goal: dominating the global market. Chinese companies have already built six reactors in Pakistan and plan to export many more.\n\nAt the same time, China is working to surpass the United States in technological innovation. China has built what it calls the world’s first “fourth generation” reactor, a gas-cooled model that can provide heat and steam for heavy industry in addition to electricity. The Chinese are also pursuing technologies that use less uranium, such as thorium reactors, or recycle spent nuclear fuel. It’s a recognition that China doesn’t have enough domestic uranium for a massive build-out of traditional reactors.\n\nEven if U.S. companies and labs remain at the forefront of innovation, one recent report warned that China was 10 to 15 years ahead of the United States in its ability to deploy next-generation reactors widely.\n\nIt’s a familiar story: The United States invented solar panels and batteries, only to watch as China scaled those technologies and now controls global markets.\n\n“Maybe we can convince some of our allies not to buy Chinese reactors, but there are going to be plenty of other countries out there with growing energy demands,” said Paul Saunders, president of the Center for National Interest, a conservative-leaning think tank. “And if America isn’t ready, we won’t be able to compete.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/world/middleeast/mass-burial-gaza.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:48:04-04:00","title":"At a Mass Burial in Gaza, Palestinians Mourn the Unknown Dead","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 22, 2025, 54 unidentified Palestinian bodies were buried in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, following their transfer from Israeli authorities.

And flailing.\n\nThe government is shut down for the 22nd day, with many federal workers not being paid, agencies and museums closed, and top lawmakers making no serious effort to resolve the disruptive impasse. Congressional staff members have begun referring to themselves as volunteers.\n\nThe House has, quite literally, ground to a halt. The chamber has not voted since Sept. 19 and Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to call members back, preventing them from doing any legislative work. He has refused to seat a new duly elected Democratic member from Arizona one month after her victory, though he encouraged her to return home and work for constituents she does not yet officially represent because he won’t administer her the oath of office.\n\nAs the Trump administration shifts billions of dollars around to take care of its priorities during the shutdown with scant input from lawmakers, ignoring Congress’s clear constitutional supremacy over the power of the purse, Republicans in control have done nothing to push back.\n\nNor have they made any move to exercise oversight of President Trump’s legally questionable military moves off the coast of South America, his imposition and threats of tariffs, or anything else that has challenged the authority of their beleaguered institution.\n\n“The Congress is adrift,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. “It’s like we have given up. And that’s not a good signal to the American public.”\n\nSince assuming office in January, Mr. Trump and his top aides, seasoned from their first stint in the White House, have aggressively and enthusiastically usurped congressional power with little resistance from G.O.P. leaders in the House and the Senate. In many instances, they have willingly ceded their prerogatives and cheered on the president.\n\nEven as administration policies threaten economic harm to huge swaths of rural America that they represent, congressional Republicans have been mainly silent as Mr. Trump has unilaterally imposed and threatened tariffs to achieve his own strategic, political and economic goals. Never mind that the Constitution gives Congress chief responsibility for levying tariffs.\n\nThe administration has embarked on deadly military operations off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia without the consent of Congress and no call from Republican lawmakers to scrutinize any oversight of the activities, even as the Pentagon cracks down on media coverage and communications with Congress.\n\nDespite deep bipartisan support for sanctions on Russia over its war with Ukraine, Republicans have again reversed course and delayed legislative action because of mixed signals from Mr. Trump, who only days ago exhibited a willingness to restrain Moscow before he again pulled back.\n\nMr. Trump himself suggested this week that Congress had little left to do after passing its sweeping domestic policy and tax bill this year since Republicans had packaged all of his top priorities into the special filibuster-proof measure adopted solely with G.O.P. votes.\n\n“We don’t need to pass any more bills,” Mr. Trump told Senate Republicans at the White House on Tuesday as they reveled in their unity in the shutdown fight over a cheeseburger-and-fries lunch. “We got everything in that bill.”\n\nLawmakers in both parties worry that the steady erosion of congressional prerogative they are witnessing daily could inflict permanent damage on the institution at the forefront of representative government.\n\n“There is a real danger that self-inflicted wounds by this institution will imperil it,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “I think people are shaking their heads that Congress has reached this point in America.”\n\nDemocrats have been largely steamrolled by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies all year. They have relied on the courts to hold the line against illegal actions by the White House, a hope that has met with mixed success.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, and his members are now employing what little leverage they do possess by denying Republicans the 60 votes they need to pass a short-term spending bill to fund the government. They are demanding that Republicans join them in extending pandemic-era Obamacare insurance subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year to avoid big premium increases on millions of people.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, refuse to negotiate with Democrats until they approve the short-term spending bill, creating the impasse that has shuttered much of the government.\n\nAnd Republican leaders have made it clear that they view their role as subordinate to the president, saying they won’t open talks with their Democratic counterparts unless Mr. Trump allows them to do so.\n\n“Leader Thune and I visited with President Trump this afternoon and he confirmed he is ready and willing for the three of us to meet with Leader Jeffries and Senator Schumer as soon as Schumer reopens the government,” the speaker wrote on social media, referring to Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader.\n\nThe current shutdown has been distinguished from past ones by a marked lack of urgency to resolve it, with senators repeating the same failed votes for days on end in a “Groundhog Day” exhibition before flying home for the weekends. The House chamber, on the other hand, has remained entirely empty except for occasional brief pro forma sessions in an extraordinary display of absenteeism.\n\nMr. Johnson has said he wants lawmakers to stay away to keep the pressure on Democrats. But there is a belief among both Democrats and Republicans that he doesn’t want to take the risk that fractious House members could convene and make his job holding the line more difficult.\n\nHe has also used the excuse of the House being out of formal session to refuse to swear in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, who was elected in September in a special election to replace her late father, Raúl.\n\nThere are evidently some limits to what Congress will swallow. Republicans this week pressed the White House to withdraw the nomination of Paul Ingrassia to head the Office of Special Counsel after Politico disclosed a series of racist and offensive texts he sent.\n\nSenate Republicans also raised the alarm on behalf of cattle ranchers who have been battered in recent years after Mr. Trump suggested that he might increase imports of Argentine beef to bolster markets there. The administration showed signs of heeding their calls.\n\nBut the funding impasse now has top Republicans talking about the possibility of a yearlong extension of current federal spending. That would further undermine Congress’s authority, shifting the power to shape spending from the once formidable Appropriations Committees to the White House and its budget director, Russell T. Vought.\n\nAt the White House luncheon on Tuesday, Mr. Trump happily celebrated Mr. Vought as “Darth Vader,” for the fear provoked by the man behind the administration’s determined drive to strip spending power from Congress.\n\n“You’re doing a great job, I have to tell you,” Mr. Trump declared of Mr. Vought.\n\nThen Senate Republicans gave a round of applause to the man eager to render them irrelevant.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/world/asia/chinese-trump-impersonator.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"00:01:24-04:00","title":"He’s Never Been to America.

at the submarine that had been used to carry drugs with a defeated look in his eyes, exhausted from endless interdiction efforts that seem to go nowhere, his sailors risking their lives while the cocaine keeps flowing.\n\nDrug smugglers, he said, were always many steps ahead.\n\nThe Ecuadorean Navy has two submarines in its fleet. And the cartels? No one really knows, but definitely many more.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Ecuador has captured about a dozen fully and semi-submersible vessels. The American authorities say they believe just a tiny fraction of such vessels have been intercepted worldwide.\n\nWe were in the sprawling naval base along waterfront of Guayaquil, Ecuador’s most populous city, looking at drug-trafficking ships seized by the navy, some with the help of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. It was a graveyard of sun-baked fishing boats, semi-submersible vessels and one hulking metal submarine.\n\nThe array of vessels was a testament to the savviness of the cartels as they come up with ways to transport drugs around the world.\n\nThe U.S. military last week attacked a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean that it claimed was ferrying cocaine. Two people were killed, but there were two survivors, including an Ecuadorean man who was repatriated.\n\nThe strike is part of the Trump administration’s campaign to destroy vessels it claims are smuggling drugs. (On Wednesday, it said it had struck a boat off the coast of Colombia, the first time such an attack had taken place in the Pacific.)\n\nMany experts say the U.S. strikes violate international law.\n\nRickety fishing vessels and speedboats still carry significant amounts of cocaine from South America to the United States, but semi-submersible vessels emerged in the 1990s as a way to try to evade U.S. authorities.\n\nTypically, most of the boat sits below the water’s surface with a fiberglass cockpit just above to allow for navigation. The boats usually have a crew of up to four, are roughly 50 feet long and can hold two tons of cocaine, the Ecuadorean Navy says.\n\nThe Ecuadorean coast guard estimated that one semi-submersible it seized had cost about $1 million to build. A ton of cocaine, by comparison, can fetch about $25 million in the United States.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, navies across South America began to see full-fledged submarines, like the hulking, 30-yard-long vessel sitting at the navy base in Guayaquil. It was found in 2010, cost about $2 million to build and could carry up to 10 tons of cocaine, the coast guard commander said.\n\nAfter some law enforcement forces began using thermal imaging cameras to detect vessels underwater, drug traffickers began covering them in lead and equipped them with cooling devices to help obscure their heat signatures, according to Insight Crime, a research organization.\n\nThe power and range of the submarines has also grown over the years. At first, they were able to smuggle drugs only from South America to Central America. Now, they can traverse the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and reach as far as Europe, Africa and Australia, traveling several thousand miles without refueling.\n\nEcuador has become a major player in the global drug trade. Some 70 percent of the world’s cocaine flows through the country. It is not a production hub, but Ecuador borders Colombia, the world’s largest cocaine producer, and Guayaquil’s busy ports, which send bananas, fish and shrimp to the world, provide a lucrative opportunity for cartels.\n\nEcuador’s coast and the Pacific in general is where most of the world’s cocaine flows, not the Caribbean, U.S. and U.N. data shows. Cocaine has also fueled a surge in violence there, turning Ecuador from Latin America’s safest country to one of the most dangerous.\n\nAs I interviewed the coast guard commander — whose name The New York Times is withholding for security reasons — fireworks went off in the near distance.\n\n“They do that every time a shipment reaches its destination,” he said with a sigh, referring to the gang that controls the neighborhood bordering the base.\n\nA modest brick wall topped with floppy barbed wire was the only thing separating Ecuador’s largest navy base from the sprawling impoverished neighborhood, which is controlled by Los Lobos, one of the country’s most powerful drug trafficking groups. The gang works closely with Mexican cartels and Albanian and Italian organized crime groups to smuggle cocaine across the world, U.S., European and Ecuadorean officials say.\n\nLast month Los Lobos was designated as a terrorist organization by the State Department.\n\nI asked the coast guard commander if he was nervous being next door to the very enemy his forces were fighting, if he ever worries that members of Los Lobos would scale the walls to attack his sailors or sabotage their equipment.\n\n“Sometimes,” he said, shrugging it off with a ‘well-what-can-you-do?’ look on his face.\n\nJosé María León Cabrera contributed reporting from Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/22/travel/motels-history-100-years.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:11:59-04:00","title":"100 Years of the Motel","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article traces the 100-year history of the motel in the United States, from its origin in 1925 with the opening of the Milestone Mo-Tel in San Luis Obispo, to its evolution, cultural significance, and modern revival.

2025-10-21T17:11:59-04:00\n\nThe Starlite Motel in Mesa, Ariz. Video by Ash Ponders for The New York Times\n\nThe motel might seem like an ageless fixture of the American landscape, but in fact, this roadside mainstay didn’t exist before Dec. 12, 1925.\n\nThat’s when Arthur and Alfred Heineman, two brothers with a successful Southern California architecture practice, opened the Milestone Mo-Tel, the first “motor hotel,” in San Luis Obispo, roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nAt the time, motorists had limited options. Their dust-covered clothes hardly suited the highbrow standards of most hotels, and parking in cities could be challenging. So many drivers stayed in autocamps, roadside resting places that sometimes offered basics like firewood and communal bathrooms, pitching tents off their running boards and cooking underneath the stars.\n\nIn contrast, the brand-new Milestone featured novel comforts like hot showers and private garages. “There were orange trees in front of every door,” said Thomas Kessler, the executive director of the History Center of San Luis Obispo County, adding, “The idea of being able to reach out and pick an orange from out your window — you know, they talk about that in ‘The Grapes of Wrath.’ It’s such a concept of the American dream.”\n\nLike those trees, motels blossomed, giving a century’s worth of asphalt explorers a place to park their cars, lay their heads and contemplate what’s down the road, and fulfilling a promise perhaps best expressed in the words of those once-ubiquitous ads for Motel 6:\n\nThe first official motel, the Milestone Mo-Tel (later renamed the Motel Inn) opened on Dec. 12, 1925, in San Luis Obispo, Calif.\n\nFord introduces the Model T, a mass-produced car aimed at the middle class.

One of those future highways, Route 66, from Chicago to Santa Monica, Calif., will come to symbolize driving through the Southwest.\n\nThe Milestone Mo-Tel, the first official motel, opens on Dec. 12. The property, later called the Motel Inn, got its name, according to local lore, because the sign painter determined that the words “Motor Hotel” would not fit in letters of the desired size.\n\nA Wigwam Village location in Kentucky, one of seven motels the chain eventually operated.\n\nThe stock market crashes, fueling the Great Depression, in which large numbers of Americans take to the roads, seeking work and a better life.

What Do Democrats Have?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T05:05:15-04:00\n\nThe Conversation convenes this week with the Opinion columnist David Brooks, the contributing Opinion writer E.J. Dionne Jr. and the former host of NPR’s “All Things Considered” Robert Siegel to discuss and debate Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral run, gerrymandering and what the No Kings protests achieved.\n\nBelow is a transcript of an episode of “The Opinions.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nRobert Siegel: I’m Robert Siegel, now a contributor to Times Opinion. I’m in conversation with two old friends, both of The New York Times. Columnist David Brooks: How are you?\n\nDavid Brooks: How are you?\n\nRobert Siegel: And contributing Opinion writer E.J. Dionne.\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr.: Great to be with you, always.\n\nSiegel: Once again, we’re together to talk about politics — and there is no shortage of things to talk about. Last month we started off with the question of authoritarianism. Do all the various claims of new presidential powers amount to a loss of fundamental liberties? Well, it seems that several million Americans think so.\n\nThey turned out all around the country to protest against kings. So let’s start there.\n\nE.J., what did you make of the No Kings protests? What did you see in it? And what did you make of the reactions to it?\n\nDionne: Well, I went down to the one here in D.C., and what I saw was patriotism.\n\nThe symbol that was most on offer everywhere along the march route was the American flag. There was even one part of the march where a bunch of people respectfully held out a very large American flag, and little kids were running underneath the flag — because there were a lot of kids there with their parents. It was a very, if I may say so of a march in D.C., a Middle American march.\n\nI think you saw that in a lot of parts of the country. And I think it put the lie to something that I found really disturbing from Speaker Mike Johnson — and others on the Republican side said this — they referred to it as the Hate America rally. It couldn’t have been more different than that.\n\nSince we are on authoritarian watch here, I think it was such a disturbing thing for him to say, because if you are opposed to his party or opposed to the president he supports, that means you hate America. One party, one leader, one country is something that our soldiers fought against in many wars. That’s not a conception of Americanism.\n\nA lot of those people who were marching were very aware of the acceleration of the move toward authoritarianism. You think of the prosecution, the indictments of James Comey, Letitia James, John Bolton — the first two utterly without reason, except that the president hates them.\n\nI think the people at this march weren’t ideological. They were just deeply concerned about the direction of the country.\n\nSiegel: Well, David, you called for a national movement as what we need — first in a column back in the spring, and most recently in a longer piece in The Atlantic. Is the No Kings movement the movement you had in mind? Does it fit the bill?\n\nBrooks: It’s getting there. It’s weird for me; I’m not a movement guy — I’m more conservative than not, and now I find myself reading Saul Alinsky and all these lefties. I’m going, “Yeah, power to the people.” So I’m going total revolutionary here.\n\nDionne: It’s about time, David. [Laughs.]\n\nBrooks: What I liked about No Kings rallies was just what E.J. mentioned: that people like me, who are kind of center right, would feel completely at home there.\n\nIf it starts looking like Occupy Wall Street, then I think: Good for you people, but it’s not for me. I’m hanging around Occupy and my hair starts falling out. But around No Kings, I just feel it’s pro-American. It’s basically in line with the cultural DNA of this country. So I’m very impressed by it.\n\nI think a couple of reservations I have — not criticisms, but things that are not yet there — if you look back at social movements that have succeeded, they’re decentralized. They happen all over, but there are always central collaborating committees. You look at the civil rights movement and they had the N.A.A.C.P., all these acronyms of all these organizations who were leading.\n\nSecond, I do think you need leaders, and I think sometimes, like Occupy, people are averse to having one person at the top. But without that, you can’t control your message. You can’t really conduct a strategy.\n\nThe civil rights movement conducted a soap opera every day. They told the story every day about segregation, and through that repeated storytelling, you really built the movement. You gave the segregators an unwinnable proposition. When you control the streets, either they cede the streets to you or they crack down on you and look like monsters. And that’s a way to achieve civic power.\n\nThe final thing that I think No Kings is so far not making is a vision. Donald Trump has a vision. Trump is a culture. He has a core story: The elites have betrayed you. But he doesn’t only have that story. He has a culture of MAGA, a culture of what a man looks like, what a woman looks like. He has a religion, basically, if you looked at the Charlie Kirk memorial service. He gives you identity. He gives you belonging.\n\nIt takes a counterculture to best the culture that Donald Trump is leading. And so far, the Democrats don’t have that; they have a bunch of tax credits. And so far, the No Kings movement doesn’t have that.\n\nDionne: There was a lot of stuff in your piece I appreciate. I particularly like the line where you said Trumpism is seeking “to amputate the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, science and the pursuit of justice, and supplant those virtues with greed, retribution, ego and appetite.”\n\nThere’s some very good stuff here.\n\nBut I’ll tell you where I take issue with you. You talked about a miasma of passivity that seems to have swept over the anti-Trump ranks. I don’t think that’s true at all. I think that you’ve seen this movement grow.\n\nI think that what is making things difficult is, in our history, I think it’s fair to say that we have never confronted a government that was willing to break the law as freely — not just break norms, which they haven’t cared about for a long time, but break the law as freely.\n\nWe haven’t seen a situation where all of the institutions of government are behaving in a partisan way. The Congress is behaving in a partisan way. And on many of these cases, most so far, the Supreme Court is behaving in a partisan way.\n\nSo people are trying to find purchase here. Where we partly agree is on this need for a strong movement across the country.\n\nI read a very good book this week by Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown called “Rural Versus Urban.”\n\nI think that you need to revisit organizing all the way down in the country, and you need to put pressure on Republicans. Because until some of the Republicans who clearly know better are willing to say so, it’s going to be very hard to break this power that Trump is amassing.\n\nBrooks: Well, he has the core story that people believe in: The elites have betrayed you. The passivity I was talking about was not so much at the bottom, though. I do think it’s there. It’s at the top.\n\nDionne: There, I agree with you.\n\nBrooks: It’s the head of the companies, it’s the head of universities, the head of law firms. They’re just lying low — in part because they’re intimidated, in part just because of the collective action problem. Who’s going to step out first?\n\nI had a friend, a business leader, who went to Europe and he said, “We’ve lost faith in the United States forever.” And I said, “It’s like Taylor Swift: ‘We are never getting back together.’”\n\nAnd the European said something interesting: It’s not because you elected Trump. We all have Trumps in our countries, so any country could do that. It’s because you didn’t rise up.\n\nHe’s looking at his business leaders, and he’s seeing them say something in private about how awful things are going, and then in public speaking a very different language. And you can measure the amount of authoritarianism in a country by how high the price is to oppose it.\n\nDionne: Totally agree about a lot of business leaders, but let’s look at some real pushback. Some law firms went over to Trump, but a whole lot of law firms said: We are not going there.\n\nThey went after Jimmy Kimmel, a whole lot of people protested, and Jimmy Kimmel was put back on the air.\n\nA lot of universities are saying no to what Trump is doing. So I totally agree with you that I want more pushback from people at the very top of the economy, but I think you’re seeing seeds of revolt that are very useful.\n\nSiegel: But let me ask you both this: David, your article made me think back to the civil rights movement and my extremely minute role as a onetime member of the Stuyvesant High School Friends of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\nDionne: God bless you.\n\nSiegel: The civil rights movement achieved a major Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, constitutional amendment against poll taxes. After the restoration of the Medicaid tax break, I don’t know what the agenda of the No Kings movement is. I assume they can’t enact it now, but I don’t even know what would be on the wish list.\n\nBrooks: I think that’s the wrong way to think about it, with all due respect to my friend. You went to Stuyvesant High School. That shows you’re smarter. [Laughs.]\n\nBut I don’t think the anti-Trump forces understand the nature of the fight, which is that Trumpism didn’t emerge overnight. It started, in some ways, back in the 19th century, with Know Nothing.\n\nBut it really started with people like Sam Francis and Christopher Lasch with his book “The Revolt of the Elites.” There was a big intellectual movement, and Trump just picked up everything Christopher Lasch wrote in that book in 1995. So what you need is a whole movement and a vision, and it has to be intellectual first.\n\nWhat I think Democrats need to do is understand that they can’t go back to their core narratives. Democrats have had some great narratives. The New Deal: We’re going to soften capitalism and make it more humane. In the 1960s: We’re going to take people who’ve been marginalized and we’re going to give them respect. Those are great narratives, but they’re not narratives right now.\n\nThe final thing I’d say is there’s a Bulgarian political scientist who made the observation that once the revolution happens, everybody changes. So, it’s not just the Republican Party. He makes a point that the Democratic Party is going to change just as much as the Republican Party. And then he makes the point that once the revolution happens, you can’t go back to who you were.\n\nHe phrases it this way: “You can have Kerensky before Lenin, but you can’t have Kerensky after Lenin.” And Kerensky, for those who didn’t go to City College in the 1930s, was a sort of a Democrat before the Russian Revolution. Once Lenin comes along and creates the revolution, you’re not going to go back to the moderate Kerensky.\n\nSo I just emphasize how radically different people have to think about where we’re going to be in five years.\n\nSiegel: Well, on that note, let’s turn to the races that are on the ballot in November. The odd-numbered year after the presidential election always draws our attention to New Jersey and Virginia, which elect a governor in that year, and of course New York City, which elects a mayor in that year.\n\nAnd this year, there’s a special interest in a California referendum on congressional redistricting. David, which of these races do you find especially interesting?\n\nBrooks: I’m going to go to where E.J. wants to go, because I am a good friend: Mamdani.\n\nI’m profoundly impressed by how much the Democrats want to be the party of rich people. If you look at how Mamdani did against Cuomo in the primary, Cuomo did very well among working-class voters and Mamdani did very well among workers making $200,000 a year.\n\nHe is a perfect candidate for educated elites. His dad is a professor. His mom’s a filmmaker. Nothing wrong with that. My dad was a professor. He has the cultural values and progressive politics that go over well in Prospect Heights or in Park Slope — these are neighborhoods in New York — and would go over well in Santa Monica, would go over well in various affluent places.\n\nBut to me, the core problem for the Democrats is they need to win the working class back. And if he’s their face, which he is about to be, I just think that’s a setback to the core problem for the Democratic Party.\n\nSiegel: But isn’t he running against the high cost of living? No one can afford an apartment at the rate things are going.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, but he’s doing things that are outside the mainstream. Our colleagues on the editorial board produced a data-strewn editorial, and it was basically about something called the center voter theory — that you run to the center and you win by running to the center.\n\nThat may not be true in New York, because New York has a lot of rich progressives, but it’s generally true. So running to the center is probably a smart thing to do.\n\nDo Mamdani’s ideas appeal to me? No. I don’t think government knows how to run a grocery store. New York already has a lot of great family grocery stores. That’s one of the beauties of New York: There are bodegas everywhere. His ideas sound good if you haven’t lived through socialism, but socialism is still socialism.\n\nDionne: I find it amazing, David, that you’re saying that the richest people in New York support Mamdani.\n\nI wish I could do a really good Bernie, but “the millionaires and the billionaires” are all supporting Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. I looked at the great map The New York Times had of the primary — every precinct facing Central Park except one little one way up in the northwestern corner.\n\nBrooks: I didn’t say the millionaires and billionaires. I said $200,000. That’s his sweet spot.\n\nDionne: It’s sort of $50,000 to $200,000. And I think that what’s interesting about Mamdani — two things.\n\nOne, let’s celebrate the paperback of your new book, “How to Know a Person,” and Mamdani acts like he read your book.\n\nHow did he start his campaign? He went to the Bronx when he was at 1 percent in the polls and went to precincts where Donald Trump did well or better than a Republican had done in a long time and he asked people: Why did you vote for Trump? Or: Why didn’t you vote at all?\n\nWhat did they tell him? They said they were worried about the cost of living. How did he orient his campaign?\n\nYou can argue with this or that proposal, but the entire campaign has been oriented around not cultural issues — he’s a cultural progressive, but that’s not what he talks about. He talks about the high cost of housing, he talks about the high cost of child care, the high cost of groceries, the high cost of transportation. He has run an economically based campaign to say New York should be affordable to everybody.\n\nAnd I wrote a column in The Times saying that he was a “sewer socialist,” which to many people might sound like I’m running him down, but I was actually building him up. Because the kinds of socialists who have succeeded in American history — there was a big movement for municipal socialism; Dan Hoan was mayor of Milwaukee for 24 years as a socialist — focused on fixing problems: fixing the sewers, which are making people sick in working-class neighborhoods.\n\nBernie Sanders, who was a mayor, talked about making sure the snow was picked up in working-class neighborhoods. So, it’s snow socialism to sewer socialism. I think he is very grounded and down to earth, and he is running, in an odd way, a campaign that’s quite related to that New York Times editorial that you referenced, even though its underlying message was rather different from Mamdani’s.\n\nBrooks: Look, I love pragmatic leaders. Mike Bloomberg, he was my version. I think New York worked a lot better after Mike Bloomberg.\n\nThere was a guy in Detroit — Duggan I think was his name, Mayor Duggan. And he was the least charismatic guy on Earth. But he said: If you want your streetlights to work, I’m your guy. He was just a boring administrator. I love those guys. And so if Mamdani was like that, I’d be all for it.\n\nAnd I should say he’s a great campaigner. He’s one of the more interesting people in American politics right now. So I don’t take that away from him. But he is an ideological person. There’s a reason he’s a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has gone further left. A lot of the people I’d like to run the D.S.A. have all quit.\n\nThen the final thing to be said is he’s got to explain why New York is so unaffordable.\n\nHouston doesn’t have this problem. If you look at where people are moving, almost every fast-growing state is a Republican state with low taxes and low housing regulations. So people are moving to Tennessee, to Texas, to Florida, to South Carolina, because they create a positive business climate.\n\nNew York has spent all of our lifetimes — and I grew up there like you; we were in the same housing project — it’s had the rent control. It’s had horrible zoning regulations. It’s just super hard to build. I think the vacancy rate in New York apartments is like minus zero, so there’s just not enough housing.\n\nThis is something I think about all the time. I love a book called “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” by Jane Jacobs. Growing up, we were all told she was a hero. She saved the West Village, and that guy Robert Moses, who was putting in all these highways, he was the villain. But now it’s looking like Jane Jacobs taught everybody that if you block the government, you can stop them from doing anything.\n\nSiegel: This is to block the Lower Manhattan Expressway from going through.\n\nBrooks: Suddenly, the story looks a little more complicated, because we’ve had 50 years of blocking all development. And this is the point our colleague Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make in their book “Abundance,” or Yoni Appelbaum in a book named “Stuck.”\n\nThe abundance movement is an effort to get some of the zoning regulations reduced, not out of some Reaganite policy, but just because we need to be able to build things anymore. And I have my doubts that somebody that ideological is going to reduce the grip that the government has on the housing market.\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: What’s ironic is that Mamdani actually did an interview with Derek Thompson where he endorsed some of the core principles of abundance, and argued that you judge a government by whether it can deliver, and that he thinks that abundance raises questions that people who want government to work and want government to work on behalf of working people need to address.\n\nSiegel: OK, one other question about Election Day coming up, which is about the California referendum. My question to each of you is: Is gerrymandering OK if the other guy did it first?\n\nDionne: Well, I think the answer is — the logic of what I’m going to say is yes.\n\nSiegel: Yes is what you’ll say.\n\nDionne: I’ll give you the answer straight up and then get there. I am, like a lot of people who are for the commissions like the one California cast, I think it would be better ——\n\nSiegel: You’re against politicians selecting their voters rather than voters selecting their politicians.\n\nDionne: Yes. And so, if you had a commission system or some sort of nonpartisan plan of making districts in every state of the country, that would be great. That’s what I’m for.\n\nIn the absence of that, when one party — on the order of the president or the request of the president — goes and redraws its district lines in Texas to say “We’re going to arbitrarily create five more congressional districts” and then other states start following and say, “Well, we’ll create more Republican districts,” then the other side can either say, “Gee, this is terrible, but we’re still for commissions,” or they can do what the Democrats and Governor Newsom did in California, which is say, “We’re still for commissions, but we’re going to draw lines to offset those five so we have a fighting chance in the election.”\n\nAnd Barack Obama — who is somebody who’s been fighting partisan redistricting and is one of the most effective advocates out for Prop 50 in California precisely because he liked nonpartisan redistricting — in this circumstance, he regards it as an emergency.\n\nBrooks: You know, there was an essay written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan years ago — I’m hitting all your sweet spots — that was called “Defining Deviancy Down.”\n\nThis is what it looks like: Donald Trump defines deviancy down. We’re redistricting. We’re just going to pick our voters. And then Gavin Newsom matches them.\n\nAnd the people who should be offended, by the way, are the voters of California and Texas. If you live in those two states, you are basically being disenfranchised because you will be living in a district where the election outcome is predetermined.\n\nThere should be outrage about this. People fought for their vote, to have the right to vote, and now people don’t care. To me, the worst example of defining deviancy down is what we’ve come to tolerate, just in how our politicians speak and in the crooked ways they rig the map, and suddenly nobody’s bothered by this. Where’s your dignity, people?\n\nThen the question I would ask E.J. is: Who was right, Obama or Newsom? And I mean Michelle Obama.\n\nShe had this famous comment years and years ago: “When they go low, we go high.” Gavin Newsom, maybe it’s unfair to him, but the other alternative is: When they go low, we go lower. Put aside morality. What’s the smart thing for Democrats to do? It’s not obvious to me that sinking to the moral level of MAGA is the right answer here.\n\nIt seems to me, if people want to turn the page on this moment, they’re going to want to turn the page in the way — and this is not a great example — of Jimmy Carter after Watergate. They’re going to want to say: I want somebody so clean, somebody who respects government, somebody who plays by the rules, who will uphold the norms that I remember. And it seems to me that’s actually a smarter play for Democrats.\n\nNow, I understand the temptation. You can’t hand away the House in 2026. So I understand the temptation. But it seems to me the long-term play here is to go high when they go low.\n\nDionne: Just for the record — in Texas, the State Legislature is imposing those districts on the people of Texas. In California, they are going to the voters. The voters of California themselves are going to decide in this referendum whether they think this is a necessary thing to do now or not.\n\nMy friend here, of course, always quotes Moynihan for his purposes, but I think that what Moynihan counseled very much throughout his career was political realism. This is not about some abstract argument of who goes lower or higher.\n\nOf course, there’s stuff Trump does that no one should do. But in a straight-up political fight where power is at stake and where the authoritarianism we talked about earlier in our conversation really needs somebody to check it, winning that next fight really matters.\n\nAnd again, this proposal they put in California acknowledges that this is not the ideal way to do it. It’s a temporary expedient.\n\nBrooks: If I could just say, I’ve heard this argument that in California the voters get to decide — and I just don’t understand it. There are multiple forms of democracy. We happen to live in a republic, where we elect people to make decisions for us.\n\nCalifornia has this system of referendum where it’s a direct democracy. I happen to think that’s an inferior form of democracy than electing people who get to make decisions. But it strikes me that Texas is not undemocratic. They’re both versions of democracy.\n\nDionne: You started talking about the people, and the people here — individual voters in California — will have a say on this question in a way they didn’t in Texas. I agree we need a mixed system.\n\nBrooks: We elect congressmen; do I have no say in what my congressman does? No, we elect people.\n\nSiegel: Well, I think we’ll just have to accept you guys differ.\n\nDionne: Would you vote for Prop 50?\n\nBrooks: No comment. [Laughs] I would be sorely tempted, to be honest, just in this one case.\n\nSiegel: A great many people cast their votes, not on the basis of either foreign policy or culture war battles but on kitchen table issues — what’s happening with the price of food, price of groceries, with the price of gasoline at the pump.\n\nLife is pretty rough for a lot of Americans right now, and yet the stock market stays in record territory. It keeps setting records. Is the U.S. riding for a fall, and if not, why not?\n\nDionne: It’s funny, we were talking this weekend — transparency for our listeners and viewers — about the fact that we wanted to talk about this. And right after I hung up the phone, I looked at my email and I had an email from Adam Roberts, an editor at The Economist. It was a newsletter which begins with the words “You are probably more exposed to a looming market crash than you think.”\n\nI think there are a lot of people who are extremely nervous. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the market. I’m a congenital bear who’s predicted 10 of the last two downturns. But I do know that there is a real disconnect between what the market has been telling us and the experience of Americans.\n\nTwo really good stories in The Times this week, Sydney Ember wrote a story with the headline “Lower-Income Americans Are Missing Car Payments,” and she points out that this is one of the clearest indications that low- and middle-income families — the economy’s foundation — could be starting to buckle.\n\nThe day before that, Ben Casselman and Colby Smith had a really good piece about how wealthier Americans, buoyed by the stock market, have continued to spend freely, while lower-income households are hit by inflation and weakening of the job market are pulling back.\n\nSo I don’t think you can have a successful economy if the middle and the bottom are falling out. The wealthy alone cannot prop up an economy.\n\nCall me nervous, not just about the economy itself. I, again, don’t know what’s going to happen in the stock market, but this is a very unhealthy situation that explains why so many Americans are discontent.\n\nBrooks: I don’t believe in timing the market, but I have been tempted for the past year to call my broker ——\n\nSiegel: Go to cash [laughs] ——\n\nBrooks: And pull the vast Brooks fortune out of the market. It’ll hurt the market when you lose that much money [laughs]. But I haven’t done it, and I’m glad I haven’t done it because I’ve been wrong.\n\nThere are some really solid fundamentals. G.D.P. growth is about 3, unemployment around 4, wage growth around 4, rent inflation is going down. So, there’s some good things in the economy. And yet, partly for the reasons E.J. said, and then the economic numbers, and then you look at consumer sentiment — consumer sentiment is in the basement because people feel rotten about the country.\n\nThen the big issue here, which is that everybody is suddenly talking about if we’re on the verge of an A.I. bubble. The reason for thinking we’re on the verge of an A.I. bubble are pretty damn obvious: the combined bill. All these big companies, Meta and OpenAI, they’re spending on the order of $400 billion or $500 billion a year. The total consumer spending on A.I. is $12 billion.\n\nWhat? You’re spending $500 billion next year. And where’s the revenue? Then you add the fact that you can’t just build a chip plant the way you built a Ford plant, where you can use the machinery for 10 years. It’s obsolete in 10 months.\n\nSo you think: Wow, they’re just vastly overspending, as they did in the railways, as they did in the early car. We’re going to have a big crash, and then A.I. will be fine.\n\nThe counterargument to that is that A.I. revenues, while small, are really going up fast. The second thing is, A.I. is not like any other technology. It’s not like the railroads. It’s like inventing omniscience. And maybe this is a remarkable opportunity. They all think so, because they’re all investing zillions of dollars, but it feels a little bubble-ish to me.\n\nSiegel: Well, I’ve heard comparisons to the 2000s and the dot-com crash, the bubble. In an article in The Economist, the Harvard professor Gita Gopinath writes that a stock market decline comparable to the 2000 dot-com crash would wipe out, she estimates, $20 trillion in wealth for American households. That’s the equivalent of about 70 percent of last year’s gross domestic product, and there’s just a lot of money out.\n\nBrooks: I am going to call my broker after. [Laughs.]\n\nDionne: Tell him Robert told you to.\n\nSiegel: Well, look, I think we should wrap up, as we did last time, by finding in the midst of all of this angst some joy, some experience that each of us has had recently, that might be a good antidote to stuff we follow in the news. David?\n\nBrooks: Because my wife likes people, we entertain a lot. I’ve actually found not as many people have people over anymore. We’ll have three or four dinner parties a week sometimes, and I’m exhausted by it. I do a lot of dishes. But I found hospitality is maybe my hobby.\n\nIt’s certainly a great pleasure to me, and one of the things we do is — she has a lot of friends who are musicians. And one of my golden rules of life is never turn up the opportunity to hang around with musicians. So we’ve had a ton of music in the house, and it’s been great — and exhausting. [Laughs.]\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: I agree with David on all of that.\n\nTwo things. One, this a great time of year for sports fans. You’ve got the World Series, the N.B.A. starts, middle of football season. That’s fun.\n\nBut this weekend I’m going up to New York, and our youngest daughter — not the one I mentioned the last time — I’m going to go up to celebrate her birthday, and also walk with her when she early votes in that election in New York that we talked about. And when you can bring together love and democracy, that’s utopia for me.\n\nSiegel: I spent Saturday in New York at my grandson’s bar mitzvah. I am, to use a technical term, still kvelling. And what added to the joy, actually, were other things that happened to be happening at that synagogue that same morning: the welcoming of two people who just converted to Judaism, and the naming of a newborn. I thought it was a celebration of life at some of its richest moments, and I felt very enriched.\n\nDionne: Mazel tov, that’s great.\n\nSiegel: I also feel enriched by hearing from you guys again. E.J. Dionne, David Brooks, Thanks so much.\n\nDionne: Thank you.\n\nBrooks: Thank you.\n\nThoughts? Email us at [email protected].\n\nThis episode of “The Opinions” was produced by Vishakha Darbha.

Financial Assistance as Shutdown Drags On\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T05:02:04-04:00\n\nWith the government shutdown continuing into its fourth week, thousands of federal employees are facing their usual pile of monthly bills without their regular paychecks.\n\nSome workers’ most recent paychecks were already missing a few days of pay, but, depending on where they work, they will miss their first full direct deposit on Friday.Many financial institutions are offering interest-free loans, fee waivers, deferred payments and other forms of temporary relief to help keep workers afloat while the political gridlock drags on.\n\nSome financial institutions already know who you are, and may be proactively providing some assistance in the background. JPMorgan Chase, for example, is refunding service and overdraft fees for customers with direct deposits made by the federal government.\n\nBut if you’re on track to miss a payment, or need more help, you’ll need to make the first move (and sometimes provide some kind of proof of where you work). If you’re not a federal employee, don’t call seeking a deal anyway. Customer service agents will probably face high call volumes if the shutdown persists, so let the people with real need get to the front of the line.\n\nHere’s a look at what type of help is available and from whom.\n\nMany financial institutions are offering a pause on payments known as forbearance, though interest will still continue to accrue. Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and U.S. Bank, for example, said they would initially provide up to three months of forbearance.\n\nPennymac, which collects payments from borrowers for a large number of mortgage loans, is also offering forbearance. It requires a conversation with customers so they know how the process works and what options they’ll have when the shutdown ends, like repayment plans or loan modifications.\n\nEach loan investor — like the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Housing Administration, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — has its own guidelines around forbearance. Once a homeowner seeking forbearance contacts the loan’s servicer, the servicer will check these guidelines and walk the homeowner through the options.\n\nForbearance or other types of deferred payment won’t hurt your credit standing, according to the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit bureaus. But if your balances begin to mount, that could pose a drag on your score.\n\nBank of America and Capital One will allow customers to defer payments for up to one month, with no late fees or additional penalties, which will not be negatively reported to the credit bureaus. Interest will continue to accrue.\n\nAlly Financial, one of the nation’s largest lenders, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBank of America, Capital One, Citi, and JPMorgan said they would waive late fees and allow customers to defer minimum payments, though interest would continue to accrue. Most banks are letting workers skip one month (without being considered late), and will re-evaluate their policies if the shutdown persists.\n\nWorkers can request forbearance through their federal student loan servicer to postpone payments. (You won’t accrue credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness while payments are paused, though you may be able to “buy back” that time later, advocates said.)\n\nFederal borrowers might also consider income-driven repayment plans, which tie the monthly payment amount to borrowers’ income and household size, depending on their circumstances. This is probably better for people who have been laid off — when your income drops to zero, so do your payments. But if the drop is only temporary, you may not get the relief you’re seeking.\n\nVerizon is offering “payment deferral options,” according to its website. There, it encourages people to request help before allowing a bill to become past due.\n\nAT&T will allow customers to push their payment beyond any due date and has posted additional information on its website.\n\nT-Mobile’s media relations department sent an email, signed “Michelle,” saying, “We always look after our customers, and that’s the same now.” Michelle did not provide more specific information.\n\nSome financial institutions will let you pause payments on existing loans. Others are going a step further: Many credit unions are extending low-cost loans to their customers, particularly those who use direct deposit.\n\nUSAA, open to members of the military, veterans and their families, will provide a no-interest loan equal to one net paycheck, up to $6,000. (The loan generally must be repaid within three months.)\n\nNavy Federal, PenFed, Coastal1, Altura, and the Congressional and U.S. Senate Federal Credit Unions, among others, are offering similar programs. And for those who are required to work without pay, the Maryland Labor Department is offering no-interest loans of $700 that must be repaid in 45 days after the shutdown ends.\n\nEligibility requirements and repayment terms will vary — and some no-interest periods expire — so be sure to read those details carefully.\n\nU.S. Bank is offering customers what it calls a Simple Loan, but it comes at a cost: It provides up to $1,000 for a $6 fee for each $100 borrowed. If you borrow $400, you’ll pay a $24 fee — that means the total borrowing cost, when translated by U.S. Bank into an annual percentage rate, is nearly 36 percent, exceeding what many credit cards charge.\n\nAm I eligible for unemployment insurance?\n\nPotentially. If you’re a furloughed federal worker, you can apply for Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees, a program specifically for federal workers, while federal contractors can apply for regular unemployment insurance. Workers should apply through the state where they work.\n\nBut since employees are likely to receive back pay, they’ll need to pay the money back. Federal employees who are still working — but not being paid — are not eligible.\n\nStates are supposed to pay benefits within two to three weeks, but they may have trouble performing routine verification checks because of the shutdown. If the process is lagging, workers should ask to file an affidavit with the unemployment office, using a form called ETA-935, said Michele Evermore, a senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance.\n\nHow will all of this affect my credit? Is there anything I can do?\n\nContacting your providers and getting into forbearance or a deferred payment plan is the best way to avoid damaging your credit score. Those measures alone won’t hurt your credit profile, though rising balances could pose a minor temporary drag — but not nearly as large as a hit from a missed payment.\n\nThe three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — will allow you to add a short note to your credit report explaining your circumstances, which lenders will see when they pull your file. The notes can be added directly through the bureaus’ websites.\n\nIt may be wise to pull copies of your credit reports as soon as possible so you’ll have a point of comparison if this situation persists. The best place to pull your reports is at annualcreditreport.com; you can try to find a free score through one of your existing providers.\n\nAre there other helpful resources?\n\nThe American Bankers Association has compiled a list of institutions and how to contact them on its website, and Senator Bernie Sanders has a list of additional resources on his website, too.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/style/leslie-jones-life-part-2-comedy.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:04:06-04:00","title":"Leslie Jones Wants to Make Everybody Laugh","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Leslie Jones, a comedian, actress, and political commentator, shares her journey from early stand-up beginnings to becoming a household name through her bold, politically charged comedy.

know what’s so crazy? I’m famous,” says the comedian Leslie Jones, clad in a black sparkling “Heart Breaker” T-shirt and ever-present towel in hand (for her hot flashes) on her new comedy special “Life Part 2.” “Why would they give fame to me? Why?” she asks. “I still go to 7-Eleven in my pajamas.”\n\nMs. Jones’s incredulity may make sense when you consider that, though she’s been doing stand-up for over 30 years — a journey that began when her college friend, Denita Abernethy, entered Ms. Jones, then a student at Colorado State University, in the “Funniest Person on Campus” competition (she won) — Ms. Jones didn’t break out until she was 47 when she joined the cast of “Saturday Night Live,” shortly after having been hired by the show as a writer. Not that she’s complaining: Ms. Jones, who at 58 now divides her time between Los Angeles and New York City, contended that she wasn’t ready for fame or success when she was younger.\n\n“I didn’t even know who the president was when I was in my 20s,” she said. “It’s like, all I wanted to know was, where’s the free tequila?”\n\nMs. Jones wasn’t apathetic; she was carrying a lot of trauma. She said she was sexually abused by a babysitter when she was a toddler. Her parents — Willie Jones Jr., an electronic engineer, and Sundra Diane Jones, a cable company employee who suffered a stroke at 38 — were struggling. Her younger brother, Rodney (who went by his middle name, Keith), dealt drugs and had trouble extricating himself from that life. And, at 19, she had been chastened by the up-and-coming comedian Jamie Foxx who offered her some salient, if harsh, advice after she bombed during a set at The World. “Go live your life and make some material — because right now you have none,” she recounts him saying in her memoir, “Leslie F*cking Jones.”\n\nSo Ms. Jones quit comedy for six years, taking on a variety of odd jobs including stints as a justice of the peace, and a bartender, hostess, waitress and cook for the same restaurant. She also worked at two Scientology-owned businesses in Glendale, Calif. (she is not a Scientologist) and, perhaps most rewardingly, was a summer league basketball coach for 10- to 12-year-old kids at the local Y.W.C.A. The kids were among the chorus of people who encouraged Ms. Jones to return to comedy. Now she had material.\n\nMs. Jones supported her developing comedy career, in which she was performing at places like the Comedy Act Theater and Maverick’s in Los Angeles, by working at restaurants including Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles. Around 2005, she chased Chris Rock as he walked to his car at an L.A. comedy club and begged him to hook her up with his vast network of contacts. In her version of the story, she said that Mr. Rock told her she wasn’t ready.\n\nMr. Rock, however, has affectionately disputed her account. “Leslie is hilarious,” he said in a phone interview. “She was always ready. The world wasn’t ready for Leslie Jones.”\n\n“Leslie writes these well-crafted jokes and makes it seem effortless when she’s performing,” he added. “She’s really genuine, so you leave her shows with the sense that you got to really know her.”\n\nBut around 2010, Ms. Jones first performed a provocative joke she wrote in 1997 that came to be called “The Slave Joke.” It was a hit, but also demonstrated that the risks she was taking were paying off. Mr. Rock put her on the top of a short list of the funniest Black women he kept when industry people asked him for recommendations — people like Lorne Michaels.\n\nMr. Rock told Mr. Michaels to audition Ms. Jones, who’d never performed nor written sketch comedy. Mr. Michaels heeded Mr. Rock’s advice and hired her as a writer in 2014, eventually bringing her on as a cast member. (That part took some negotiating — she said Mr. Michaels asked if she’d “go down to feature pay” but she demanded to be paid for both roles, per her contract. Mr. Michaels obliged.)\n\nBeing on “S.N.L.” was initially a daunting challenge for Ms. Jones, especially joining as the oldest member of the cast. “I didn’t understand until I got there that being 47 was ‘older people,’” she said, laughing about being on a show where one of the older cast members was Kenan Thompson, who was 11 years younger than her. “I was not the grown-up in the room. I never was. Kenan was the grown-up in the room. The only thing that I did was show them that at my age, you’re not old.”\n\n“Leslie is a force of nature and truly like a sister to me,” Mr. Thompson wrote in an email.\n\nShe became known for her confrontational and occasionally self-deprecating persona, managing to skewer the antics of awful men and cop to occasionally getting mixed up with them. The qualities she brought to the table lent themselves extremely well to her political commentary, which she honed on “Weekend Update,” and which she has recently brought to “The Daily Show,” where she’s been serving as a regular contributor since March 2024.\n\nAfter earning three Emmy nominations during her five-season tenure on “Saturday Night Live” (2014-2019), she’s now on her third comedy special, has starred in movies (e.g., “Coming 2 America,” and the female reboot of “Ghostbusters”), has had recurring roles in TV series, and has hosted award and game shows. In 2023, she published her best-selling memoir, which recounts not only her complicated path to stardom, but her experiences with racism, rejection and profound loss. She has, through force of will, become a household name.\n\n“My dream was to be like tourists come up to me and go, ‘Leslie, picture, please!’” she said. “If you want to be a really good artist, you’re supposed to play to the masses.”\n\nSome of the experiences that helped Ms. Jones find the courage and the focus included the loss of her parents, within six months of each other from heart-related illnesses. But it was the death of her younger brother, in November 2009, that devastated her. It led her to soul-searching, concluding there had been no foundation to her standup — it was all about getting laughs.\n\nMs. Jones worried her “smart jokes were too smart” for her to perform; she’d written them with other comics in mind, like her idols Whoopi Goldberg or Marsha Warfield. Or, for herself for “when I got really funny.”\n\nMs. Jones found herself gripped by an existential crisis.\n\n“I said at the time, the worst thing to me is not even death; it’s losing someone, you know,” she said. She recalled the words of her late father, who wanted nothing more than to see his daughter thrive. He told her she’d have to “become undeniable.” Ms. Jones said, “I pulled out the jokes that I’d been saying, ‘Hey, am I smart enough to do this?’”\n\nOne bit was “The Slave Joke,” which she’d conceived of in 1997 while angrily devouring a leftover container of cold fried rice after a bad day. The joke features Ms. Jones — a six-foot-tall former college basketball player — imagining herself as a much sought-after enslaved woman in the Antebellum South.\n\n“I was pissed off when I wrote it because I was like, the choices I have in men is disgusting,” Ms. Jones said. “And I’m glad I waited because when it was time for me to pull it out, I was ready to do it. I was doing everything I could to hurt myself or get myself in trouble, or get where somebody wanted to fight me — in that mode of ‘somebody pinch me. Is my brother dead for real?’”\n\nAt first, recalled Ms. Jones, “People came after me. They told me I was praising slavery,” which rattled her. She told them, “You’re not really listening.”\n\nThe conflict was one of the joke’s greatest virtues, she realized, because, “I was doing comedy that’s making people talk in their living rooms.” Ms. Jones’s subversion of the power structure by making subjugation benefit her persona in some way, is one of the hallmarks of her comedy. Though, she admitted with a cackle, “Ultimately, it’s about getting a guy.”\n\nMs. Jones revisits minefield territory in “Life Part 2” — a show in which she imagines her ideal funeral, and calls out straight men for their terrible physical and mental hygiene (Ms. Jones is a strong advocate of therapy) — with a MeToo joke that treads very close to the line.\n\nMs. Jones dealt with a great deal of racist and sexist abuse online after the all-female reboot of “Ghostbusters” was released in 2016, but as disturbed and upset as she was, she contended, “I still can’t hate nobody, because when people come at me, I just feel sorry for them. To me, the fact that racism still exists is just maddening, because at this point, racism is being uneducated.”\n\nMs. Jones speaks from lived experience. Born in Memphis, she grew up as an Army brat at Fort Bragg, and said she witnessed the way parents socialized their kids to be racist. She said all the young kids, white and Black, were playing together rather innocently. When her mother discovered that the white parents were using racist epithets for Ms. Jones, they had to have a brutal conversation about racism that rocked Ms. Jones’s world.\n\nShe knew her father, who had grown up in the Jim Crow South, had endured racist violence, and had to come to “hate white people” — but she did not. She surmised that, at least in theory, if racism could be taught it could be untaught, which is where her comedy might step in. If they’re laughing, they’re listening.\n\nEarlier this month in Manhattan, while hanging out with friends in front of the Village Underground, where Ms. Jones loves to work on new material, a young woman asked the comedian for a selfie. Soon, more people — Zoomers to Boomers of various racial and ethnic backgrounds — recognized the comedian, and requested their own selfies. It was her dream come true.\n\n“You know, I have a lot of MAGA people that are my fans because I speak their language,” said Ms. Jones. “My demographic of people is, like, from 18 to 74. I have humor for everyone — I, at least, try to. When I’m writing my jokes, I write them like a human woman, because if it makes me laugh, it’s gonna make everybody laugh. I want to make everybody laugh.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/nyc-canal-street-fear-anger.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"03:00:18-04:00","title":"Fear and Anger Fill New York’s Canal Street After Immigration Raid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 22, 2025, a federal raid by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE targeted over 50 vendors on Canal Street in Lower Manhattan, primarily West African and Chinese street vendors selling counterfeit luxury goods.

The strip had turned quiet. Most of the vendors were gone. Tourists had been asking where they were, some shopkeepers said.\n\nA day earlier, more than 50 federal agents had descended on a stretch of the street that is famous for the African men and Chinese women who illegally sell bootleg luxury merchandise to tourists.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday that its agents had arrested nine men accused of living in the United States illegally. The men, mostly from West Africa and some with prior arrests, were targeted in an operation “focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods,” the department said. The agents also arrested four protesters.\n\nPeople across New York City appeared on edge after the raid, seemingly bracing for the activation of President Trump’s threat to deploy military personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to New York City, which he often casts as lawless and dangerous. Mr. Trump has already moved to send troops to other Democratic-led cities — Chicago, Washington, Memphis, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the depth of the anger over the raid was evident as several hundred demonstrators rallied at 26 Federal Plaza, the New York City headquarters of ICE. Lifting placards and their voices, the demonstrators chanted, “Vendor power!”\n\nThe demonstrators marched north from Foley Square to Canal Street, filling about five blocks as they walked, before turning onto Broadway. One woman climbed on a police car in front of the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse.\n\n“It’s important to be here,” said Philip Clay, 45, an English tutor and visual artist from Queens who was demonstrating. “No ICE.”\n\nEarlier, Bethany Li, the executive director of a civil rights organization, said that many people in and around Chinatown felt afraid but ready to resist. Her organization, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, is blocks from where the raid took place.\n\n“People have been scared by the fact that the federal government is coming in and harming and threatening residents in immigrant neighborhoods,” Ms. Li said. “But then I think there’s also this mood of defiance. It’s like: ‘No, ICE can’t come in and terrorize our communities in this way. Not in New York.’”\n\nSome vendors who lingered on Wednesday condemned the raid as demeaning and racist.\n\n“How many white people pass here?” said Mohamed Touré, 46. “All of them have papers? No.”\n\nMr. Touré said he was stopped by federal officers on Tuesday afternoon and asked for his papers. “We need a little bit of respect, too,” he said, adding that agents were going up only to Black vendors.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sent a tweet Wednesday hailing the raid. “Everyone does not, in fact, like counterfeit products being sold. Nor do they like violent illegal aliens,” the agency’s tweet said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, had defended the raid during an interview on Fox News and promised an increase in arrests.\n\nIn New York City, elected officials and human rights advocates denounced Tuesday’s sweep.\n\nThe New York attorney general, Letitia James, announced that she had launched an online portal to collect photos and videos of ICE officials to determine whether they were breaking the law during enforcement actions.\n\nFor generations, Canal Street has been a gathering point for merchants of Asian descent, especially those from China. But when migrants began to arrive in New York City by the tens of thousands three years ago under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., West African vendors flocked to the area to sell their wares.\n\nAndrew B. Wolf, an assistant professor of global labor and work at Cornell University who researches street vending, said that it is common for ethnic groups to specialize in certain industries after the first arrivals gain a foothold and begin to channel in newcomers.\n\n“There’s the one person actually making money in the community, and then the other people come,” Mr. Wolf said.\n\nHe noted that the Police Department regularly conducts operations in the neighborhood, arresting vendors and confiscating their property. He said that the city’s real estate, retail and restaurant groups had lobbied to make it difficult for vendors to get licenses, making them a frequent target of law enforcement.\n\nPolice officers raided the Canal Street area in August 2023, focusing on Wooster and Lispenard Streets. They arrested eight vendors, seizing millions of dollars in merchandise. In January, they conducted another sting, arresting several vendors and recovering suitcases and black trash bags filled with watches and other goods.\n\nResidents said that they were used to seeing police officers — not federal agents — arresting vendors.\n\n“This is definitely not normal,” said Barrett Maguire, 64, a building superintendent in TriBeCa. Mr. Maguire has walked down Canal Street since the 1980s, encountering sellers hawking fake designer bags and sunglasses.\n\nJean-Claude and Aurore Csont, visiting New York on their honeymoon from Toulouse, France, were in a double-decker tourist bus that had rumbled along Canal Street days before the raid. They saw the street teeming with vendors, their wares displayed on sheets and in little carts.\n\n“They have to live, you know,” Mr. Csont said. “They’re not really bothering anyone.”\n\nMs. Csont said that they had seen vendors like them in Rome and Paris, and she viewed them as “part of the charm.”\n\nJack Tchen, a historian who studies New York’s Chinatown, said that the raid had paralyzed activity in a part of the city where Chinese immigrants had worked for decades to build a home. Mr. Tchen said that the raid followed a pattern of discrimination against people of Chinese descent in America.\n\n“Anti-Chinese attitudes have been in this country for a long time,” said Mr. Tchen, whose work focuses on what he describes as antiracist and anti-colonialist stories. “Whereas, oftentimes Chinese-made goods were very welcomed. The elites — you know, porcelain, silks, furniture — and cheap stuff — fortune cookies. Everything has been has been readily consumed in the American commercial culture.”\n\nThough street vendors have sometimes irritated shopkeepers because they block doorsteps and create a crowded environment, they also can bring in more business. Some competitors lamented their absence.\n\n“There’s nobody out here,” said Awa Ngam, who has been selling sweatshirts and T-shirts with a license at Canal and Lafayette Streets for more than a decade and who has seen West African vendors there for years. “I don’t like it today.”\n\nNate Schweber contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/gavin-newsom-marc-benioff.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"23:46:58-04:00","title":"Newsom Says Benioff Is Still ‘Family’ Despite the National Guard Remarks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Governor Gavin Newsom of California reaffirmed his personal bond with Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, despite political fallout caused by Benioff’s controversial remarks in favor of deploying the National Guard to San Francisco.

2025-10-22T23:46:58-04:00\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Wednesday that Marc Benioff remains like family to him, even after the tech titan touched off a political firestorm this month when he said that President Trump should send the National Guard to San Francisco.\n\nMr. Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, and Mr. Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, are longtime friends. Their families are so close that Mr. Benioff is the godfather of Mr. Newsom’s oldest child, Montana. And, the governor said, Mr. Benioff’s mother “has a special place in my heart.”\n\n“Marc’s family,” Mr. Newsom said in an interview Wednesday with The New York Times after an economic development conference in Stockton, Calif.\n\nThe two were allies in a different San Francisco era, years before each had a meteoric rise in their chosen fields. Mr. Benioff and his wife have donated to Mr. Newsom’s political campaigns over many years.\n\nSo the governor was surprised when he read that Mr. Benioff had told The New York Times this month he wanted troops sent to San Francisco to tackle crime. Few things might have set the friends further apart.\n\nMr. Newsom has attacked Mr. Trump ever since the president deployed troops to Los Angeles in June, warning Americans of his threat to democracy in a nationally televised speech and trolling the president on social media. He sued the Trump administration over the troop deployment to Los Angeles and said this week that he would sue the president again if the National Guard was sent to San Francisco.\n\nMr. Benioff was long seen as a more progressive voice than his tech billionaire counterparts and hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential run. He has been praised for his hefty donations to San Francisco institutions, including liberal causes. But he has surprised Democrats this year by aligning with Mr. Trump.\n\nThough Mr. Benioff has made a rightward turn, his comments stung leaders in San Francisco — and Mr. Newsom — because they felt the city had been unfairly maligned by conservatives for years.\n\n“It was disappointing,” Mr. Newsom said. “But that doesn’t change the way I feel about him as a human being, and his family.”\n\nThe governor said he had reached out to his friend after reading the Times article in which Mr. Benioff said that he had thrown his support behind Mr. Trump and thought the president should send troops to San Francisco.\n\nThey engaged in “a lot of back and forth,” Mr. Newsom said, declining to share details about their conversations.\n\nMr. Benioff told The Times that he had never been as progressive as some believed and that he had been registered to vote as a Republican before he became an independent. He said that he was concerned about crime in San Francisco and that the city needed to hire more police officers.\n\nA week after Mr. Benioff’s initial comments were published, he publicly apologized and said that he no longer believed the president should send the National Guard to San Francisco. He said he had made the comments with a sense of caution as the city prepared to welcome 50,000 visitors for his company’s annual Dreamforce conference.\n\nAs Mr. Newsom spoke on Wednesday afternoon, Customs and Border Protection agents were heading to the San Francisco Bay Area for an immigration enforcement operation that the governor said he believed would soon lead to a deployment of troops. Immigration raids are likely to draw protests, which the president will use as a pretext to send in the National Guard, the governor predicted.\n\nIt is part of an “authoritarian playbook,” Mr. Newsom said.\n\nHe said he thought that Mr. Trump would have sent federal agents to the Bay Area regardless of Mr. Benioff’s comments, because the president has been saying for several weeks that San Francisco was among the several cities to which he wanted to send military forces. But Mr. Newsom said it was possible that Mr. Benioff’s remarks “may have accelerated something.”\n\nStill, the governor called his friend “a good human being.”\n\n“We just do not see the world with the same set of eyes,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-ice-agent-arrest.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"22:59:37-04:00","title":"Pelosi Says Police May Arrest Federal Agents Who Violate California Law","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of anticipated federal immigration raids in the San Francisco Bay Area, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Kevin Mullin have urged that local law enforcement in California may arrest federal agents who violate state law — including through excessive force — during such operations.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested on Wednesday that local police could arrest federal agents if they break California law while conducting immigration raids that are expected this week in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWith Border Patrol agents due to arrive, Ms. Pelosi issued the stark warning along with Kevin Mullin, a fellow Democratic representative, who represents the small slice of San Francisco that Ms. Pelosi doesn’t. President Trump has said several times in recent weeks that he wanted to send federal forces to the city.\n\n“While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,” they wrote in a statement on Wednesday. “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.”\n\nA spokeswoman with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe idea appears to have come from Brooke Jenkins, the San Francisco district attorney. Ms. Jenkins said in an interview on Wednesday that she came up with the strategy after seeing federal agents repeatedly roughing up people in Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nIf federal agents came to her city and did the same, District Attorney Jenkins decided, she would treat them like anybody else breaking the law and would seek to prosecute them.\n\nHit people with batons? Beat them up? Not on her watch, she said.\n\n“I had lead time to think about what authority I have and what I can do,” she said. “This is something I felt very strongly about, and I had my office research it.”\n\nDistrict Attorney Jenkins said she had communicated with the San Francisco Police Department about arresting federal agents for “clear, excessive use of force” and that the agency was on board with the concept. A spokesman for the department did not return a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nDistrict Attorney Jenkins said she did not envision police officers handcuffing federal agents in full view on city streets. Instead, she said, local law enforcement could review camera footage of beatings, if they occur, and try to identify the agent involved. Then, she said, she would ask a judge to sign a warrant for the agent’s arrest and seek to prosecute the agent in court.\n\n“For me, this is about San Francisco and what I need to do for San Francisco,” she said.\n\nThat could be much easier said than done. Many federal agents are operating in masks and without badges or other identification; a California law barring agents from wearing masks does not take effect until January and even then is quite likely to face legal challenges. And the Trump administration could seek immunity for its officers or ignore the warrants altogether, Ms. Jenkins acknowledged.\n\nShe said she had not discussed her idea with other prosecutors in California or around the country.\n\nDistrict Attorney Jenkins shared the idea on X earlier this month after Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, said that he would support President Trump sending National Guard troops to San Francisco. (Mr. Benioff later recanted and apologized for his statement on the Guard.)\n\nThe ability of states to arrest federal officers is murky, and without much legal precedent, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. A state cannot unduly interfere with the ability of a federal agent to enforce federal law, he said, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have the legal right to apprehend individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.\n\n“As long as the ICE agents are acting legally, the state can’t prosecute them and hold them liable, even if it dislikes what they’re doing,” Mr. Chemerinsky said.\n\nBut immigration agents who overstep their legal bounds — for instance, by using excessive force — could be sued in California, he said.\n\n“I think the ICE agents can be sued, for battery, for excessive force, in state court, and I think they can be similarly prosecuted,” Mr. Chemerinsky said. “If ICE agents act beyond their legal authority, and violate state law in doing so, they can be prosecuted.”\n\nIn their statement, Representatives Pelosi and Mullin made clear that they believed federal immigration agents had overstepped their authority in other situations.\n\n“Reports of a planned mass immigration raid in the Bay Area are an appalling abuse of law enforcement power,” they wrote. “Broad sweeps that target families and terrorize law-abiding residents betray our nation’s values and waste resources that should focus on real threats to public safety.”\n\nSpokespeople for both Democrats declined to further explain how they believed local or state police should arrest federal agents.\n\nRepresentative Sam Liccardo, a Democrat who previously served as the mayor of San Jose, said he had spoken with colleagues and local law enforcement officials about such an action.\n\n“All law enforcement must comply with the Constitution,” he said, “and to the extent that there’s a violation of federal or state constitutional protections or civil liberties, there’s certainly a basis for asserting a violation.”\n\nIn other cities where the federal government has escalated immigration enforcement, local authorities have complained that federal agents have bent the law and abused civilians.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna, another Bay Area Democrat, has pushed for a requirement that immigration agents wear body cameras and visibly display their names during operations.\n\n“The issue is, a lot of these ICE agents are harassing American citizens,” he said. “They’re acting in a lawless way.”\n\nShawn Hubler contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/business/oil-prices-russia-sanctions.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:59:30-04:00","title":"Oil Price Jumps on Trump’s Russia Sanctions","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oil prices surged after President Trump announced sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, reflecting a significant shift in U.S. policy toward pressuring Russia over its war in Ukraine.

Putin over the war in Ukraine mounted.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, rose about 5.4 percent to almost $66 a barrel. European natural gas prices also rose more than 3 percent as the European Union approved its own package of sanctions on Russia, which include a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas from 2027.\n\nRichard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a research firm, said Mr. Trump’s actions would have both a symbolic and a real impact on a market that has become accustomed to the Trump administration avoiding moves against Russia.\n\n“Just the decision to make this announcement is going to send quite a shock wave through the market,” Mr. Bronze said. “It feels like the president has finally reached the point where he recognizes that Putin is not going to make concessions or engage in meaningful diplomacy without facing significant pressure first.”\n\nAlthough Russia’s natural gas flows have been crimped, Moscow has been able to maintain oil exports through sales, often at discounted prices, to countries like India and China. The question, analysts say, is whether Mr. Trump has the appetite to squeeze Russia further.\n\nMr. Bronze said Mr. Trump’s moves, coupled with actions by Britain and the European Union, would probably “have quite a significant impact, particularly on Russian flows to India.”\n\nMr. Bronze said that Reliance Industries, India’s top oil refiner, had a large contract for Russian crude, and it and other Indian buyers would “likely all pause purchases until they get a stronger sense of how these sanctions will be enforced.”\n\nIndia is the second-largest buyer of Russian crude, taking 1.6 million to 1.8 million barrels a day. Mr. Bronze also said China, Russia’s largest customer, and Turkey, the third largest, might also slow their purchases in the coming weeks. These pauses could lead to more oil being stuck on tankers.\n\nMr. Trump’s actions threaten to restrict one of the world’s main sources of crude supplies. Russia exports around 4.5 million barrels a day, Mr. Bronze estimated.\n\nThe two companies that are the focus of the U.S. sanctions, Rosneft and Lukoil, are Russia’s largest oil producers. They have taken an increased role in exports after two other oil companies, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, were sanctioned in January by the Biden administration.\n\nThe sanctions are likely to ripple through the market as buyers of Russian crude shop for alternatives. Mr. Bronze said that prices for Brent crude could approach $70 a barrel.\n\nOil prices have recently come under pressure because of worries that supply may greatly exceed demand in the coming months. A group of eight producing countries that belong to the OPEC Plus cartel have been adding oil to the market, compounding the concerns.\n\nThere is uncertainty, however, over how much surplus crude could come onto the market. With OPEC Plus having increased production, there is now relatively little spare capacity or extra oil that can be easily produced.\n\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there have been extensive efforts by the United States and Europe to reduce Moscow’s revenue from sales of oil and natural gas that are considered crucial to sustaining its war effort.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/world/middleeast/egypt-good-sahel-evil-sahel.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"00:01:15-04:00","title":"Can a Beach Really Be Evil?

Ask the Sun-Seekers in Good Sahel.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T00:01:15-04:00\n\nThere’s no sign, as you drive the sun-broiled highway down Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, that announces where the Good Coast ends and where the Evil Coast begins. Good or Evil, the waves are the same pure turquoise, the sands the same flawless white.\n\nBut for Egyptians who summer on the North Coast, migrating there from Cairo just as New Yorkers converge on the Hamptons and Michiganders go up north, there is no mistaking which is which.\n\nThere’s Sahel el-Tayeb, or the Good Coast, as Egyptians call it.\n\nSimple, wholesome vacations, with little to do but play in the sea, read and relax. Body-covering burkinis and hijabs on most women. Unpretentious hotels and rental houses. Simple beachside cafes with plastic chairs and a few fresh seafood joints dotting the coastal highway. Every few minutes, hawkers pass the beachgoers’ colorful umbrellas with honeyed wafers called fresca and trays of clams, the time-honored snacks of Sahel summers.\n\nAnd then there’s Sahel el-Shireer, or the Evil Coast.\n\nMillion-dollar beachfront villas and Louis Vuitton bags by the sun loungers. J. Lo concerts and raves where Peggy Gou is D.J. Waterfront outposts of Cairo’s most upscale restaurants and boutiques. Bikinis, designer sunglasses and boho-chic cover-ups on most women. Less than an hour’s drive west from Good Sahel, the same fresca wafers and clams cost more than twice as much, and for the price of a weekend stay, you could splurge on a trip to St.-Tropez.\n\n“It used to be: take four or five outfits and flip-flops and no makeup, that’s it,” said Aziza Shalash, 24, a graduate student who grew up going to Good Sahel until her family bought a place in Almaza Bay, the biggest influencer magnet of Evil Sahel. “Now when you go to the beach, you have to have your hair done and wear makeup and take pictures of yourself.”\n\nThe Good/Evil divide — two stretches of near-identical coastline distinguished mainly by money, bikinis and booze — mirrors a fundamental division in Egypt, where social class is tightly braided with attitudes toward Western-style social freedoms. But as economic crises have widened the gulf between Egypt’s upper class and everyone else, the accelerating exclusivity of status spots like Evil Sahel has prompted even some expensively groomed eyebrows to rise.\n\nEVIL SAHEL (Sahel el-Shireer)\n\nGOOD SAHEL (Sahel el-Tayeb)\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\nGreen Beach\n\nBy The New York Times\n\n“It’s ‘evil’ because they spend a lot of money,” said Mohieddin el-Ashmawy, 83, a retired naval officer who has summered in Good Sahel since before there was an Evil Sahel. “With every step there, money talks.”\n\nThe class gap became harder than ever to ignore in 2022, when Egypt’s already rickety economy crashed. Three years later, what’s left of the middle class can barely afford school fees and meat, let alone beach vacations.\n\nAround the same time, exclusivity in Evil Sahel was escalating to outright exclusion. Replacing a more informal system that allowed people to invite friends or family to the beach, gated communities began requiring QR codes issued only to property owners or renters for entry. Some demand another code for beach access.\n\nThe codes have become such a hot commodity that people sell them online, generating mild controversy and, in due course, a TikTok trend.\n\nDevelopments in Good Sahel are also gated, but the rules are nowhere near as strict.\n\n“It’s like a border, seriously,” said Dalia el-Ghoneimy, 46, who was visiting Almaza in July for the first time. “The beach shouldn’t be like this. The beach, it’s for everyone.”\n\nDecades ago, it was.\n\nRich or not, many Egyptians used to go to beaches around the Mediterranean city of Alexandria in summer. Many poorer Egyptians still do.\n\nBut private developers have raced westward down the shoreline more recently, first opening modest resorts, then unveiling ever trendier developments farther west. These days, they also market to wealthy tourists from the Persian Gulf, Europe and anyone else who can afford it. (A one-week rental in peak season can run to $6,000 or more.)\n\nThe developers’ glossy billboards loom over Cairo’s dusty streets and the coastal highway, selling a vision of immaculate summers: “Seazen — Find Your Zen.” “Forever by the Sea — Ras El-Hekma.” None of the smiling women cover their hair or arms; every ad is in English, a language that comes easily to Egypt’s international-school-educated elite.\n\nFor affluent, liberal Egyptians, the appeal is obvious.\n\nGated Sahel communities like Almaza or Marassi, an ultrawealthy enclave built by a Dubai developer, are the summer version of the manicured suburban compounds where affluent Cairenes live, work and play the rest of the year: luxurious havens where they can do and wear what they want without judgment.\n\nMost Egyptians are much more conservative, pushing such behavior behind closed doors elsewhere in the country. As one popular meme has it, there is the “Egypt” of English-speaking, socially liberal elites, and the “Masr” — Arabic for Egypt — of everyone else.\n\nOver in Good Sahel, any mention of the nightlife and scanty cladding down the coast tends to provoke instant disapproval.\n\n“These girls have parents!” Mr. el-Ashmawy, the longtime Good Sahel-goer, cried with dismay, as he recounted a national scandal in which two girls at an Evil Sahel concert were caught on video kissing the Lebanese singer on the cheeks.\n\n“It’s super, super free, and I don’t like it,” said Doaa Reda, 25, a teacher who was feasting at a fish restaurant next to the coastal highway, citing social media videos she had seen. “Egypt is a Muslim country. Parties and bikinis, this stuff really isn’t Egyptian society.”\n\nMany Evil Sahel-goers openly say its exclusivity is necessary to keep such moralizing at bay. The QR codes ensure that only “select people” — people who “have the same culture” — are allowed in, said Mahmoud Abdoun, 56, who works in interior design.\n\nHe and his wife were sitting under an Almaza cabana facing the sea, which lapped the sand in warm, mesmerizing waves of celadon and turquoise. At a beach club to their right, pop music shimmered as waiters bent over loungers with frozen margaritas, yuzu avocado toasts and platters of fresh mango. A royal-purple motorboat that looked exactly like a racecar tore up the water; a parasail drifted by.\n\nSome parents cited the safety of a gated community.\n\n“You want to be able to relax and have your kids running around,” said Sherif Seif, 48, a marketing executive who was presiding over his son’s birthday party under a nearby cabana.\n\nMr. Seif noted that Sahel was hardly the only place in the world where people pay a premium for privacy and security. “It’s a private compound with private residences,” he said.\n\nDisentangling such opinions from class is never easy in stratified Egypt, and there are more than a few Egyptians, well-to-do and not, who see the restrictions as little more than institutionalized snobbery.\n\nAt Green Beach, a gated community in Good Sahel, Radwa, a translator sitting with a book and wearing a mauve burkini, said she had never visited Evil Sahel. “I know I’d judge them,” she said. “But if I went there, they’d judge me because I dress like this.” (She declined to give her last name, not wanting to stir up social tensions.)\n\nYet the Sahel divides, like Egypt’s, are not always as clear-cut as they may appear.\n\nThere are many Egyptians who can afford the Evil Sahel hot spots but still prefer the simpler pleasures of Good Sahel. Some unveiled women sunbathe in Good Sahel; some women in burkinis swim in Evil Sahel.\n\nMr. Seif recounted seeing a man dressed in religious garb pass him on the beach one morning. The man’s phone was blaring Quranic verses for all to hear.\n\nMr. Seif didn’t mind, he said. Like many other Egyptians who try to balance fun with faith, he himself prays on days that he is not drinking, fasts during Ramadan and attends Friday Prayer, he said.\n\n“That’s why I have a problem with ‘Evil Sahel, Good Sahel,’” he said. “Because it’s all about you and what you do.”\n\nHe took a swig of his vodka, and grinned.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/opinion/democrats-rich-poor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:59:04-04:00","title":"How Democrats Became the Party of the Well-to-Do","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article argues that the Democratic Party has undergone a significant class realignment, shifting from its traditional identity as the party of the poor and working class to one that now primarily represents higher-income, wealthier voters.

Federal demographic and campaign-finance data from the past two decades reveal that the class alignment of the two parties has flipped: Americans who live in wealthier parts of the country and earn above-average incomes now mostly vote for Democrats, while Americans who make less money and live in poorer areas now mostly vote for Republicans.\n\nMedian household income\n\nof congressional districts\n\nMedian household income of congressional districts\n\nThese charts show just how far, and how quickly, the Democratic Party’s base has strayed from its working-class roots. In 2009, the average Democratic congressional district had a median household income, after adjusting for inflation, of about $67,000 — less than the roughly $70,000 median income in Republican districts. By 2023, though, the average Democratic district’s median income had risen to $81,000, while that of the average Republican district had fallen to $69,000.\n\nAmericans who lived in wealthier areas used to have mostly Republican representatives. But since 2016, the top 50 percent of districts by income have been mostly Democratic. Astoundingly, Democrats held more than two-thirds of the top quarter of districts by income in 2023.\n\n111th Congress, 2009\n\nDemocratic district\n\nRepublican district\n\nIncome rank\n\n111th Congress, 2009\n\nDemocratic district\n\nRepublican district\n\nIncome rank\n\n111th Congress, 2009\n\nDemocratic district\n\nRepublican district\n\nIn 2009, Democrats represented\n\nmost of America’s less affluent districts.\n\nIncome rank\n\n111th Congress, 2009\n\nDemocratic district\n\nRepublican district\n\nIn 2009, Democrats represented most\n\nof America’s less affluent districts.\n\nIncome rank\n\n118th Congress, 2023\n\nDemocratic district\n\nRepublican district\n\nRecently, richer districts have voted for Democrats.\n\nIncome rank\n\nWhile Republicans have made inroads into working and middle class districts.\n\n118th Congress, 2023\n\nDemocratic district\n\nRepublican district\n\nRecently, richer districts have voted for Democrats.\n\nIncome rank\n\nWhile Republicans have made inroads into working and middle class districts.\n\nEach rectangle on this chart represents a congressional district at the start of 2009. The districts are ranked from left to right by median household income.\n\nDuring President Obama’s first term, many of the country’s poorest districts were represented by Democrats.\n\nBy 2023, the Democratic Party’s political base had shifted to the rich. Working class districts, meanwhile, were largely represented by Republicans.\n\nNow, it is the Republican Party that represents the middle-class and poor regions of the country that were once the Democratic base. In 2010, Democrats represented 81 of the poorest 25 percent of districts, and Republicans just 30. Last year, Republicans held 65 of those districts, compared with 46 for Democrats.\n\nIf Democrats don’t reverse course, they may soon find themselves unable to win presidential elections. Increasingly, the party is made up of urban professionals who graduated from four-year universities and command relatively high salaries. Having more of these supporters has been a boon to the party’s finances, but electorally, the shift has been a disaster.\n\nThe electoral power of high-income voters is limited: Not only are they a smaller demographic, but they are also concentrated in a handful of coastal states that do not decide presidential elections. By contrast, the lower-income voters lost by Democrats are dispersed across the battleground states that increasingly determine the Electoral College outcome. Under this system, no candidate can win the presidency today without galvanizing the working class.\n\nFor most of the past century, that was the Democratic Party’s political playbook. So what changed?\n\nFrom the 1930s to the mid-1990s, Democrats mainly held power in Washington by helping the little guy, including by creating Social Security and other safety-net programs, raising the minimum wage and promoting organized labor (sometimes even with support from Republicans).\n\nCentral to the party’s working-class support was its hostility to free trade policies. By opposing agreements with China, Japan, and Mexico until the 1990s, Democrats showed American workers that they were willing to fight for American jobs.\n\nBut in the early 1980s, an obscure California congressman, Tony Coelho, took over the fund-raising operations for House Democrats and urged them to make friends with corporate lobbyists. Within a few years, Democrats were drawing as much money from corporate PACs as Republicans.\n\nNot surprisingly, Democrats began to embrace policies championed by industry, including free trade agreements that benefited corporations over the workers who made up the party’s base. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton bucked the party’s allegiance to labor when he signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law and expanded trade with China, Vietnam and others.\n\nWhen Barack Obama ran in the Democratic presidential primaries against Hillary Clinton in 2008, he declared that some of Mr. Clinton’s trade deals had “put special interests over workers’ interests.” But in office, Mr. Obama and his administration pushed to expand trade with the Trans-Pacific Partnership over the opposition of labor leaders, declined to pursue an antitrust case against Google Inc. and enacted health care and financial-services laws that the business lobby largely accepted or actively supported.\n\nBy this point, Democrats had already made inroads with higher-income voters, while lower-income ones had started to gravitate toward Republicans. By 2016, the Democratic Party had become sufficiently disconnected from its blue-collar foundations to create an opening for Donald Trump to swoop in and steal the party’s 100-year-old playbook, riding to victory with greater-than-expected support from working-class Americans. Last November, Mr. Trump increased his margins with working-class white, Black and Latino voters, while wealthy and corporate America flocked largely to Ms. Harris.\n\nTo have any chance of winning back the presidency, the Democratic Party needs to reclaim the banner of the little guy from the Republican Party.\n\nWhatever the path forward, a necessary step is for congressional Democrats to stop aligning themselves with the country’s economic elite. A prime example: In the 2020 election, Joe Biden and just about every other Democrat running for president campaigned on repealing Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans. After Mr. Biden won and Democrats took control of Congress, party leaders didn’t hold a single vote to do so. Though Mr. Biden governed as the most pro-labor Democrat in a generation, a small group of pro-business Democrats in Congress stymied much of his agenda.\n\nThe same rift within the party was on display this summer when, during the congressional skirmish over Mr. Trump’s domestic policy legislation, some Democrats from wealthy parts of New York and California worked with Republicans to lift the so-called SALT cap, which limits the amount of state and local taxes that wealthy people can deduct from their federal returns. The higher cap will primarily benefit six-figure households in places like New York and California, while doing nothing for working-class voters whom Democrats need to win key battleground states.\n\nRight now, Democrats don’t have the power in Congress to deliver the kind of transformative economic policies that might help to reverse this class realignment. But they do appear to be confronting the urgency of regaining standing with their legacy constituency. In explaining the government shutdown, Senate Democrats have cited a near-doubling of Obamacare insurance premiums next year and cuts to Medicaid and other health programs under Mr. Trump’s domestic policy law. Mr. Trump and Republicans have tried to redefine that law as a boon to blue-collar Americans by, for example, reducing taxes on tips and overtime. But Democrats have the better argument: The signature policy achievement of Mr. Trump’s second presidency benefits big business and the rich while cutting health care coverage, food aid and student loan programs for the poor.\n\nIt is too soon to tell which message will win out, but recent polling and town hall confrontations between G.O.P. lawmakers and their constituents indicate that Republicans were already bearing blame for cuts to safety-net programs before the shutdown. If Democrats can persuade voters that Mr. Trump’s agenda is doing more to harm regular Americans than to help them, it would be an important start toward reclaiming their place as the party of the working class.\n\nNote: Data from U.S. Census Bureau.
