They also say the horses are overworked and live in inadequate stables, and that their drivers flaunt city regulations, including leaving behind piles of horse manure.\n \n\n   \n  “Horses have collapsed, even dropped dead on the streets recently. Multiple horses have had violent runaway spooking incidents, crashing into vehicles, sending New Yorkers to the hospital, and nearly trampling others,” New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets, or NYCLASS, said  in a Friday statement .\n \n\n   \n  New York City Mayor Eric Adams said city lawmakers ignored the opinions of the “vast majority of New Yorkers” who want the industry ended. The outgoing Democrat  threw his support  behind the proposed ban in recent months and issued  an executive order  stepping up enforcement of the industry,\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a shame that the City Council has once again refused to follow the will of our citizens, while simultaneously endangering pedestrians, drivers, and animals alike,” Adams said  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  The council’s Democratic leadership has long resisted calls to hold a public hearing and vote on the proposal, which calls for winding down the industry as early as next summer.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s vote was instead instigated by the bill’s sponsor, who invoked a procedural rule to force a committee vote.\n \n\n   \n  “This was one of the most undemocratic displays I have ever witnessed in the New York City Council,” Council Member Robert Holden, an outgoing Queens Democrat, said in a statement after his bid was denied. “The Council could not care less what New Yorkers think.”\n \n\n   \n  Benjamin Fang-Estrada, a spokesperson for City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, suggested Holden simply failed to do the “legislative work of building support” among his colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “The Council recognizes that this is a difficult and emotional issue, and any path forward requires a sponsor bringing all parties together in a constructive way,” he said in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Central Park Conservancy, the influential nonprofit that manages the 843-acre park, also came out in support of an industry ban, citing its outsized impact on public safety and road infrastructure in the increasingly crowded park.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/michelle-obama-woman-president-not-ready","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"14:55:00Z","title":"Michelle Obama Says U.S. Is Not Ready for a Woman President","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former First Lady Michelle Obama stated during a Brooklyn event promoting her book 'The Look' that the United States is not ready for a woman president, citing Kamala Harris’s loss in the 2024 election as evidence.

It spilled into a messy exchange of blows as the controversy around Epstein again took center stage in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene,” Trump said in a  post  to social media, adding that Greene, who is running for reelection in 2026, has “gone Far Left.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene has publicly warned in recent weeks that Trump has been too focused on foreign policy and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home – taking her message to outlets like CNN and  ABC’s “The View.”  Greene, who arrived in Congress in 2021, has until recently been an ardent and outspoken Trump supporter.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican responded to Trump in a  social media post  Friday, writing, “Of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  She added on Saturday that she is facing threats against her, which she said Trump “fueled and egged on.”\n \n\n   \n  “I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected,” Greene wrote  on X .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Friday, Trump defended his efforts to engage with foreign leaders and travel abroad amid Greene’s criticism, suggesting that his relationships on the world stage have benefited her district and expressing openness to endorsing a potential primary challenger.\n \n\n   \n  “Marjorie Taylor Greene said, ‘Oh, gee, I’m spending too much time overseas. So let’s say I don’t meet with China. You know what’s happened right now to Georgia? To every other state?” Trump said aboard Air Force One.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “They’re not working because your magnets and your rare earths would’ve kicked in, and there wouldn’t have been a factory in the world working if I didn’t have a relationship overseas with China.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that he is in the United States “95, 98% of the time.”\n \n\n   \n  “The last thing I want to do is travel 22 hours in an airplane, as nice as this plane is,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump warned that Greene has “changed” politically in recent weeks as the Georgia congresswoman has publicly lambasted the White House’s messaging on the government shutdown and Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that her constituents aren’t going to be happy. Already, I have people calling me. They want to challenge her to a race in her district in Georgia,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  He also said he was open to endorsing a rival GOP candidate in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  Greene is one of four House Republicans who signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on release of Justice Department documents pertaining to the Epstein case, but CNN has reported that the number of House Republicans who could break from Trump and vote for the files’ release could be greater. Trump has repeatedly and emphatically described calls for transparency around his ties to Epstein as a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  But Greene’s message has also extended more broadly to target Trump’s economic policies, suggesting that the White House needs to improve its messaging on affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  Greene fired back in her social media post on Friday with a pair of screenshots of text messages that appeared to be sent to Trump and his aide Natalie Harp.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans, she wrote, “wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to a contact in her phone labeled “DJT,” Greene encouraged Trump to “lean into” Epstein’s ties to other high-profile figures and what she described as the “deep state.” In a separate message to Harp, she voiced her support for Trump but said the White House must “stop ignoring the women. … Them being raped as teenagers is not a hoax.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with comments from Rep.

in eastern Congo.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, M23 seized Goma and Bukavu, two key cities in eastern Congo, in a major escalation of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Backed by  neighboring Rwanda,  M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups fighting for control in Congo’s  mineral-rich  east. With 7 million people displaced, the conflict in Congo has been described by the United Nations as “one of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth.”\n \n\n   \n  The agreement signed in Doha on Saturday, following mediation by  Qatar  and the United States, is not yet a final peace agreement, but rather a framework outlining the measures required to reach one, the head of the M23 delegation, Benjamin Mbonimpa, said in a video posted on X.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be neither any change in the situation on the ground, nor any activity whatsoever, until the measures are debated, negotiated and discussed one by one and a final peace agreement is reached,” Mbonimpa said.\n \n\n   \n  The Congolese government said in a statement the framework agreement signed on Saturday includes eight measures that serve as a basis for a peace deal. Two of the measures — agreements on the release of prisoners and the creation of a ceasefire oversight body — were already signed in September and October.\n \n\n   \n  The six other measures, which in part include the restoration of state authority in rebel-controlled areas, humanitarian access, and the resettlement of refugees, will be subject to discussion and negotiation in the next two weeks, the Congolese government said.\n \n\n   \n  Qatar has hosted multiple rounds of talks since April between the Congo and M23, mainly to set preconditions for a peace deal and agree on confidence-building steps, but both sides still accuse each other of violating peace terms and fighting has continued.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Congo and M23 signed a signed a declaration of principles in Qatar to end the conflict and commit to a comprehensive peace agreement. They agreed to finalize the deal by Aug. 18 but missed the deadline, blaming each other for breaches of the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Massad Boulos, senior adviser to  US President Donald Trump , attended the ceremony in Doha on Saturday and called the framework agreement a “starting point.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is only the beginning, but we know the final outcome will be very fruitful,” he said, calling it a “historic” opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also led mediation efforts between Rwanda — which is accused of backing M23 — and Congo, leading to the signing of a peace deal between the two countries in June.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/europe/leo-hollywood-vatican-cinema-intl","dateOfPublication":"1115-11-15","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00.000-05:00","title":"Cate Blanchett and Spike Lee join Pope Leo as he hosts star-packed Vatican meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant cultural and religious event, Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, hosted a star-studded meeting at the Vatican with prominent film stars including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee, Monica Bellucci, Adam Scott, and Sergio Castellitto.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:07 PM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump suggested he has made up his mind on a course of action in Venezuela following multiple  high-level briefings  this week and a mounting US  show of force  in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Officials briefed Trump this week on options for military operations inside Venezuela, four sources told CNN, as he weighs the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign to potentially oust President  Nicolas Maduro . The US military, meanwhile, has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded “Operation Southern Spear.”\n \n\n   \n  The president indicated Friday he was drawing closer to a path forward on his attempts to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — and the possibility of regime change.\n \n\n   \n  “I sort of have made up my mind — yeah. I mean, I can’t tell you what it would be, but I sort of have,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked directly about those meetings and whether he had made a decision.\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump been briefed on?\n \n\n   \n  A small group, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, briefed the president on Wednesday. A larger national security team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top officials, met with Trump in the Situation Room on Thursday, according to a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team reviewed target options during both meetings.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including air strikes on military or government facilities and drug trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine production facilities and drug-trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action. Trump said last month he had  authorized the CIA  to operate in the country, but administration officials  told lawmakers last week  that the US didn’t have a legal justification that would support attacks against any land targets — though it is possible they could generate one. Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  The president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n    What assets are in the region?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,   the US has amassed its naval forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration has launched  at least 20 strikes  on alleged drug-trafficking boats, an effort officials say is meant to disrupt the flow of drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the region earlier this week. In addition to the aircraft carrier itself — described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform” — the US has amassed roughly 15,000 military personnel in the region, alongside more than a dozen warships, including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship, amphibious assault vessels, and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela, in turn, has said  it is launching  a “massive mobilization” of military personnel, weapons and equipment.\n \n\n   \n     What is Maduro saying? \n \n\n   \n  Experts have warned that if Trump ordered strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, the US president could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency,\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Caracas on Friday, Maduro warned that US military intervention could lay the groundwork for what he described as “another Gaza,” a “new Afghanistan” or “Vietnam again.”\n \n\n   \n  Offering a direct message to the US, he said, “Stop the insane hand of those who order bombing, killing and bringing war to South America, to the Caribbean. Stop the war. No to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Extended US military involvement also runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars. Both Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth served in the military during the Iraq War and have since expressed skepticism about entangling the US in foreign conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/ukraine-russia-assassination-attempt-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00Z","title":"Ukraine attacks key Russian oil hub as deadly strikes pound Kyiv","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine conducted a major strike on Novorossiysk, a key Russian oil export terminal, using Neptune cruise missiles and drone systems, damaging critical infrastructure and igniting a major blaze.

an attack acknowledged by officials from both countries that highlights Kyiv’s escalating efforts to target a key source of war revenue for Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian General Staff said damage was caused to “valuable” infrastructure at the port and oil terminal, as well as a launcher from Russia’s S400 air defense system.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian weapons were used in the attack on Novorossiysk, including long-range Neptune missiles and various types of strike UAVs, the General Staff said. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had launched the domestically produced long-range Neptune cruise missiles at Russian targets, without specifying where.\n \n\n   \n  “This is our entirely justified response to the ongoing Russian terror,” Zelensky said in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said this week that Ukraine was “increasing the effectiveness” of the use of domestic long-range weapons, including Neptune and Flamingo missiles, as well as jet drones.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, a source within the Security Service of Ukraine said forces struck the “second-largest oil export center in Russia,” damaging oil tankers, pipeline infrastructure and pumping stations.\n \n\n   \n  The operation ignited a “major” fire at the facility, which remained burning on Friday morning, according to the source, who added that anti-aircraft missile systems were also hit.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratiev, confirmed the attack on the oil depot in Novorossiysk, claiming that fragments of downed Ukrainian drones had hit the oil depot.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kondratiev, at least four people were wounded as a result of Ukraine’s attack on the port city, adding that at least four apartment buildings and two private homes had been damaged.

The Russian strikes on Ukraine’s capital killed at least seven people and injured dozens more, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  A married couple, aged 71 and 73, were among those killed, Kyiv police said.\n \n\n   \n  Also killed was the widow of the first victim of the Chernobyl disaster, according to the  Ukrainian agency  that manages the ruins of the nuclear power plant. In a post on Facebook, the agency said 73-year old Natalia Khodemchuk died from burns sustained during a Russian strike on her apartment building. Her husband, Valeriy, was a senior operator of the main circulation pump when an explosion tore through Chernobyl’s No. 4 reactor on April 26, 1986, causing the world’s worst nuclear accident.\n \n\n   \n  Two more people were killed in a Russian attack on the Black Sea city of Chornomorsk on Friday morning, according to the head of the Odesa regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n    Foiled assassination plot\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Russia’s security service has claimed it foiled a plot by Ukraine to assassinate a high-ranking Kremlin official inside Russia as the alleged target visited a graveyard.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian special services were planning to target the unnamed man, described as “one of the highest-ranking officials of the Russian state,” while he was visiting the graves of his relatives at a cemetery outside Moscow, according to a Friday statement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n \n\n   \n  The FSB also claimed in its statement that Ukraine is planning similar attacks inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  CNN could not independently verify Russia’s claims.

It’s good to move around in fog because it’s harder for drones to hit you, but it’s also hard for us, and it all turns into some kind of backgammon (game) on this land,” said one Ukrainian soldier in the area.\n \n\n   \n  The fog has helped a Ukrainian assault regiment carry out raids in recent days into parts of Pokrovsk where Russian forces are present “darting across the rail lines that bisect Pokrovsk,” according to military analyst David Axe.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian drone operator Yevhen Strokan wrote on X Thursday: “Firefights are breaking out in the most unexpected places (especially after fog).”\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainians usually use surveillance drones to track Russian troops’ movements but the weather is interfering with that.\n \n\n   \n  “Fog, wind and rain significantly degrade drone operations, enabling Russian infiltration through Ukrainian positions,” analyst Michael Kofman, who has recently visited Ukraine, posted on X Friday.\n \n\n   \n  On a porous and fluid frontline, Axe said on his Substack Trench Art this week, “the bad weather and resulting gaps in overhead surveillance” by Ukrainian as well as Russian drones “only intensify the confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  That can help the Russians, he added, whose goals “require them (to) probe and advance until they eventually gain firm control of new territory,” but it can also benefit the Ukrainians when they want to conduct raids into Russian-held territory or rescue surrounded units.\n \n\n   \n    Russia’s ‘numerical superiority’\n \n\n   \n  The weather has also helped the Russians in the Ukrainian region of  Zaporizhzhia , where, according to a statement from the Russian defense ministry Saturday, they have seized the village of Yablukove as well as two nearby villages.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military said Saturday that there had been intense assault operations and massive artillery shelling by the Russians in parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions in southern Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  It said there had been nearly 40 clashes over the past day, adding that “enemy losses amounted to nearly 300 personnel and 58 vehicles.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian units had been withdrawn from one village in Zaporizhzhia “to positions more favourable for defense,” the Ukrainian military said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the situation in parts of the south had significantly deteriorated, with the enemy “taking advantage of its numerical superiority in forces and resources” to take three villages.\n \n\n   \n  Russian troops are now about 90 kilometers (55 miles) from the regional capital, the city of Zaporizhzhia, and within 10 kilometers of the town of Huliaipole, whose capture has been a long-standing goal for Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  The town’s military administration said another 34 civilians had been evacuated Friday. “There is danger at every turn, but people are risking their own lives to help with the evacuation,” it said on Facebook.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/business/federal-reserve-kugler-trading","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"15:34:00-05:00","title":"Former Fed official Adriana Kugler violated trading rules, disclosure report shows","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Federal Reserve Board member Adriana Kugler resigned in August 2025 after being found to have violated the central bank’s blackout trading rules by purchasing stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Caterpillar (CAT), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) during a prohibited period just before a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dr. Adriana Kugler, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors who abruptly announced her resignation in August, broke the central bank’s trading rules, according to a  report released  Saturday by the US Office of Government Ethics.\n \n\n   \n  That disclosure shows violations of purchasing stocks and making those trades in 2024 during a “blackout period,” which is ahead of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings when officials are prohibited from trading securities.\n \n\n   \n  An official from the Federal Reserve told CNN that the ethics report Kugler filed had detailed financial transactions that explicitly violated the central bank’s policy. In advance of July’s FOMC meeting, which Kugler did not attend, she requested a waiver from the Fed’s “blackout trading restrictions” — intended to ensure Federal Reserve officials don’t profit off of monetary policy decisions that can have large impacts on stock performance — to address “impermissible holdings.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell denied the waiver, and Kugler resigned.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, Kugler had been given training after another issue led Fed ethics officials to refer Kugler to the Office of the Inspector General, the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed announced new trading rules in October 2021 following a controversy over trades made by senior officials. The rules banned policymakers and senior staff from buying individual stocks and bonds and restricted active trading. The Fed also sought to increase the frequency of reporting and public disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the stocks that Kugler invested in include Apple ( AAPL ), Caterpillar ( CAT ) and Palo Alto Networks ( PANW ).\n \n\n   \n  Kugler signed the public financial disclosure report on September 11. The report also notes, “Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler’s spouse, without Dr. Kugler’s knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.”\n \n\n   \n  Kugler did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. The Federal Reserve has not commented on the report released by the Office of Government Ethics.\n \n\n   \n  Kugler was appointed by then-President Joe Biden in 2023, and her term was slated to end in January 2026. The Fed did not cite a reason for her departure at the time of her resignation on August 1.\n \n\n   \n  After Kugler announced her exit, President Donald Trump said he was “very happy” about having an open spot on the Fed Board. Trump filled the seat by tapping Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers. Miran has participated in two Fed meetings and  broken ranks  with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.\n \n\n   \n  Kugler previously served in the Obama administration as the chief economist to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and is a professor at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts released a statement Saturday calling for stronger ethics rules to prevent Fed officials from improper trading.\n \n\n   \n  “Independence does not mean impunity, and Congress needs to pass bipartisan legislation to make the Fed more transparent and accountable,” said Warren, who is a ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. “The American people should be able to trust that the Fed’s decisions are driven by the best interests of the American people, and not the personal interests of individual officials or the political interests of Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n   This is story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/us/ely-s-parker-lawyer-ny-bar","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"10:34:00-05:00","title":"Native American Leader Ely S.

Parker, a Tonawanda Seneca from western New York, never took no for an answer.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the Civil War, Parker’s offer to enlist was rejected outright by another New Yorker, Secretary of State William H. Seward, who – according to historians – told the Seneca leader the war dividing America “was an affair between white men and one in which the Indian was not called on to act.”\n \n\n   \n  “Go home, cultivate your farm, and we will settle our own troubles among ourselves without any Indian aid,” Seward told Parker, who also unsuccessfully petitioned Congress to grant him US citizenship so he could enlist. Native Americans would not be made citizens until 1924.\n \n\n   \n  But Parker had connections: He was a close friend of future Union Army Commander Ulysses S. Grant, who eventually intervened and endorsed his commission as captain. He would become a top aide to the Union Army’s most revered general.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, in a ceremonial courtroom in downtown Buffalo, supporters and direct descendants of Parker gathered for a celebration of his resiliency, with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, Fourth Department posthumously admitting him to the bar – 176 years after he had been denied because Native Americans were not considered US citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “The posthumous admission to the bar is fitting and deserving of a man who lived his life with integrity,” said C. Joseph Genetin-Pilawa, an associate professor of history at George Mason University who has written extensively about Parker. “He didn’t give up. He continued to fight for what he believed in.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the first Native American posthumously admitted to the bar in US history, according to legal experts. The petition for admission was made on behalf of his great-great-great-grandniece,  Melissa Parker Leonard , whose father, Alvin, often played the chief in historical reenactments. The effort dates to 2020, when former Texas appellate Justice John Browning, a law professor at Faulkner University, first approached Alvin Parker, who died in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite all the odds, all the adversity, the Seneca people still reside in western New York,” Parker Leonard, a 42-year-old educator and vice president of The Buffalo History Museum, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s recognition not only for Ely, but for anyone who had a role in keeping us here … I really believe my relatives back then, 200 years ago, were desperately trying to maintain their land because they were thinking of us and the generations to come.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Weight of his community was on his shoulders’\n \n\n   \n  At the Erie County Court Building on Friday, the bar admission ceremony opened with a  recitation of the Thanksgiving address  – an invocation within Indigenous Haudenosaunee communities that gives thanks to the earth and its abundance.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, the day has come,” said Justice Gerald Whalen, presiding judge of the appellate division, calling the moment “the last steps on the long road to correcting a historic injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  “Despite his exclusion, Ely Parker served his community, his nation and this country in a manner that will serve as an inspiration to generations to come,” Whalen said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker was born in 1828 on the Tonawanda Seneca Reservation in New York. His birth name was Ha-sa-no-an-da, which means “Leading Name,” according to the bar admission petition and other biographical information. During his formative years, in 1838, their ancestral land was taken from the Senecas through a treaty historians have called fraudulent.\n \n\n   \n  He studied at a Baptist mission school, where he adopted the name of a minister named “Ely.” The petition said Parker excelled in debate and oratory in White schools. He learned to defend himself in more ways than one.\n \n\n   \n  “Once or twice I have been severely abused,” he once wrote in a letter to a friend, according to the  Historical Society of the New York Courts . “But I returned blow for blow with savage ferocity. Whether I gained the upper hand of my antagonist I leave the public to decide. For mind you, these quarrels were public. Bad business, but it could not be helped.”\n \n\n   \n  He was just a teen, the petition said, when Parker began using his mastery of English to serve as “translator, scribe, and interpreter” during meetings in Washington between government officials and Tonawanda Seneca leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “He wrote letters back home and it’s clear that this was very emotionally draining,” Genetin-Pilawa told CNN. “It was taxing on him. I think that he felt like a lot of pressure from his community, like the weight of his community was on his shoulders.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s law studies started when he was 18 with a law firm in Ellicottville, a village south of Buffalo. With no formal licensing requirements at the time, most lawyers received their training “reading the law,” preparing arguments and sitting in on proceedings, according to the petition – which said Parker was “well-educated and steeped in the law” by the age of 21.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Parker was denied bar admission. New York’s highest court had “ruled that only natural-born or naturalized citizens could be admitted to practice and, as a Seneca, he was neither,” according to the  Historical Society of the New York Courts .\n \n\n   \n    ‘His best changed the course of our history’\n \n\n   \n  Parker instead turned to studying civil engineering, which led to work on projects such as the Erie Canal and the construction of a customs house and post office in Illinois, where he befriended Grant, according to historians. But he continued to use his legal training to serve the Seneca people, embarking with another lawyer on a 20-year battle to win the Tonawanda Seneca ancestral lands, the petition said. The effort secured two “rare victories for Native American rights in the High Court.”\n \n\n   \n  During Friday’s bar admission ceremony, one speaker lamented Parker is largely remembered for his role as a top aide to Grant during and after the Civil War. He was part of Grant’s inner circle and was present at Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox. He is credited with drafting the articles of surrender.\n \n\n   \n  “After today, Ely’s legacy will no longer appear as a mere footnote in the story of Ulysses S. Grant,” said Lee Redeye, a Seneca attorney and deputy counsel for the Seneca Nation of Indians, who, along with Browning, filed the petition for Parker’s admission. “From this moment forward, Ely’s life will stand tall on its own merits, an example for all native people aspiring to do great things.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “I wish that I could declare that the battles Ely fought in his lifetime are relics of the past, but even now, in this so-called modern age, Indigenous people face a relentless onslaught from external forces determined to erase our way of life.”\n \n\n   \n  When Grant was elected president, Parker became the first Native American appointed to the post of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, according to the petition. He experienced financial troubles later in life and worked as a clerk with the New York City Police Department until the time of his death in 1895.\n \n\n   \n  Ely Parker’s posthumous admission is the eighth in US legal history, according to Browning. Previous cases involved Asian American and Black American aspiring attorneys from the 19th and early 20th centuries who were also denied admission due to the color of their skin.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is deeply personal for our family. It allows Ely to rest in the knowledge that he did his best and that his best changed the course of our history,” Parker Leonard said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/americas/us-military-drills-venezuela-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:51:00-05:00","title":"US to hold new military drills in Trinidad and Tobago amid tensions with Venezuela","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is conducting new five-day military drills in Trinidad and Tobago, beginning on November 16, 2025, involving its 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.

coming for your holiday wine \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Choosing the right wine to pair with your Thanksgiving meal can be as stressful as cooking the turkey. And this year, it’s going to be worse.\n \n\n   \n  Shoppers can expect higher prices and possibly slimmer selections at their local wine shops, as importers are facing steep tariffs and shopkeepers are dealing with declining demand.\n \n\n   \n  Bottled wine prices have risen nearly 20% over the past 25 years and 8% over the past decade, according to the latest government data.   Several reasons are to blame, including  climate change , inflation and rising production costs.\n \n\n   \n  Wine prices at  McCabes Wine & Spirits  shop in Manhattan are between 5% to 12% higher this year because “it’s the reality of the tariffs, shipping, manufacturing and labor,” said owner Daniel Mesznik.\n \n\n   \n  His shop, like others in the United States, are working to strike a delicate balance. They’re dealing with higher upfront costs due to a hodgepodge of tariffs from President Donald Trump’s administration — notably, a 15% tariff on European Union imports — while trying not to pass too any of those costs to their customers\n \n\n   \n  “We’re doing our best to keep those increases to a minimum for our guests,” he told CNN. “But, I think folks understand that this is the current reality and they’re receptive to it and they’re understanding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs are affecting the bottom line even more for importers of wine. Elenteny Imports, a logistics and distribution company that works with 9,000 retailers and restaurants, said wine sales are down 13% year over year.\n \n\n   \n    Wine woes\n \n\n   \n  Wine volume consumed   in the United States declined 3% between 2019 and 2024, and it’s expected to fall another 4% from 2024 to 2029, according to IWSR, an alcohol data insights firm.\n \n\n   \n  “For casual drinking occasions, wine has often been the choice for drinkers who prefer not to drink beer. But wine can be expensive and only comes in larger bottles,” said Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR.\n \n\n   \n  For the past few years, drinkers have been shifting their preferences to spirits and canned cocktails.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen wine volumes consistently decline year after year, while ready-to-drink beverages, which are less expensive, come in convenient sizes and packs, and benefit from continual flavor innovations, are growing rapidly,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  2025 is another gloomy year, according to data from Elenteny. Order volumes for imported wines show that year-to-date bookings are down nearly 30%.\n \n\n   \n  Demand has sunk following a “post-pandemic frothiness,” Elenteny CEO Alexi Cashen told CNN, but said “absolutely that tariffs are the persecutory issue here.”\n \n\n   \n   Domestic wines , which Trump thought the tariffs would help, aren’t selling any better this year, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Mesznik’s shop, which recently reopened following a 16-month renovation, has shifted some of its focus from wine to tequila. He added 40% more brands and types and moved them to the front of the shop.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, tequila and mezcal are exempt from tariffs since both fall under the 2018 free trade agreement Trump signed with Mexico during his first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Tequila are in the most beautiful bottles. It’s the category in my business that everyone gravitates to right now and I want that to be front and center,” Mesznik said.\n \n\n   \n  Wine used to be roughly 70% of his annual sales but will drop to 65% this year because of growth in other categories, like agave, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Smaller selections?\n \n\n   \n  With drastically smaller orders coming in from overseas, including a 50% drop from France and 66% decline from Italy, per Elenteny’s data, shoppers might see that reflected on store shelves.\n \n\n   \n  “Many retailers, distributors, and restaurants have streamlined their wine offerings in response to the falling overall demand for alcoholic beverages ,  including wine,” Mike Veseth, the  Wine Economist , told CNN. “Consumers might have to search more than usual to find a particular brand.”\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the uncertainty, Veseth said, is the  upcoming Supreme Court decision  about the legality of tariffs, “which discourages wine business from making investment or taking decisive action on prices.”\n \n\n   \n  In particular, Cashen said mid-priced wines between $40 to $50 wines “struggle the most,” while low-end bottles and premium wines are selling well, further  underscoring the “K-shaped” economy. \n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Mesznik said his shop is ordering “smarter” compared to years’ past, buying from fewer wholesalers that offer deals when buying more cases.\n \n\n   \n  “For example, we have a Pinot Noir from Argentina this month that’s on sale. Whereas I may only buy normally 1 or 3 cases of that, I’m ordering 5 and 10 cases,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/weather/southern-california-storm-flooding-risk-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:45:00-05:00","title":"A Strong Pacific Storm Increases Risk of Life-Threatening Flooding in Southern California","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A strong Pacific storm fueled by an atmospheric river is bringing heavy rainfall to Southern California, increasing the risk of life-threatening flooding, mudslides, and debris flows—especially in burn scar areas like the Palisades, Hurst, Sunset, Eaton, and Bridge.

bringing soaking rain to Southern California, increasing the risk of life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders are in effect for “vulnerable properties” within the Palisades, Hurst and Sunset burn scars, according to a Friday news release from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n \n\n   \n  The threat is tied to a multi-day storm that began Thursday in northern and central California. Widespread  rainfall totals  of 1 to 2 inches fell along the coast into Friday morning, with isolated amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the coastal mountain ranges.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco received nearly an inch and a half of rain Thursday, almost  75% of November’s average. November marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  The flood threat has intensified since then as an  atmospheric river  feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The first round of rainfall soaked the same region Friday, but Saturday’s rain is expected to be heavier, with rainfall rates likely reaching an inch per hour at times.\n \n\n   \n  This second round of rain has the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Friday night into Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through Saturday evening. The National Weather Service warns that the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads.\n \n\n   \n    Burn scar areas on alert\n \n\n   \n  Areas burned by recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows.\n \n\n   \n  Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders in effect from Friday evening to Sunday morning cover parts of the Palisades, Hurst and Sunset burn scars, but those are not the only areas at risk of dangerous debris flows.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the Eaton and Bridge burn scars also have a high threat of “significant” debris flows, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest rain should ease late Saturday, but the region isn’t in the clear right away. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won’t take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/middleeast/ceasefire-gaza-israel-hamas-tunnels-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:34:00-05:00","title":"Weeks into the Gaza ceasefire, scores of Hamas fighters remain stuck in tunnels under Gaza","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Weeks after the October 10, 2025 ceasefire in Gaza, scores of Hamas fighters remain trapped in underground tunnels beneath Rafah, just east of the yellow line dividing Israeli-occupied and Hamas-controlled zones.

Dahman, Oren Liebermann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:34 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Deep underneath the wreckage of Rafah, southern  Gaza,  the war is not over.\n \n\n   \n  Scores of Hamas militants, split up into independent cells, are trapped in tunnels underground behind Israeli lines, as mediators try to find a solution that doesn’t collapse the  month-old ceasefire in Gaza. \n \n\n   \n  The issue of how to deal with up to 200 Hamas militants in Israeli-occupied territory in Gaza, is more than just a tactical problem for Israel’s military. It is a sensitive diplomatic matter with no clear way out.\n \n\n   \n  These cells – and it’s unclear exactly how many there are or their precise locations – have fortified themselves in these tunnels since the ceasefire divided Gaza along the so-called yellow line one month ago: Israel occupies territory east of the line while Hamas reasserts power west of it.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear he has no intention of simply letting the Hamas cells walk out of the tunnels and return to the Hamas-controlled part of Gaza. Hamas has said its militants will never turn themselves in and hand over their weapons.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is pushing Israel to make progress towards some sort of viable solution, according to two Israeli sources, and Trump’s son-in-law - US envoy Jared Kushner - brought up the issue with Netanyahu in meetings earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The Americans want to move ahead to the next phase and close the Rafah prisoners file,” one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The second phase of the ceasefire involves the creation of an international security force in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the further withdrawal of Israeli forces. Every element requires challenging negotiations with multiple countries, And the Hamas militants in Gaza are one more piece of an increasingly difficult diplomatic puzzle.\n \n\n   \n  One idea was to deport the militants to a third country, with Turkey considered a possible option, the other source said. But no such solution has materialized.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the week, Netanyahu’s office issued several denials regarding various reports about the release of what Israel sees as terror cells. “The prime minister did not commit to the Americans to release the prisoners from Rafah,” a senior Israeli official said in statement on Tuesday, adding a few hours later that “contrary to reports, no agreed-upon solution exists.”\n \n\n   \n  Without a resolution, the cells are a ticking time-bomb. With little or no access to food and water, the Hamas militants are left with a simple choice: surrender or fight. Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations,  previously told CNN  that “Hamas doesn’t even know how many are there that are still alive.”\n \n\n   \n  And the impasse has already proven a threat to the overall ceasefire that took effect on October 10.\n \n\n   \n  It is likely that these isolated cells – removed from Hamas command and control – were responsible for recent attacks on Israeli forces that prompted massive Israeli retaliation and twice threatened the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  On October 19, after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israel unleashed strikes that killed at least 44 Palestinians. Just over a week later, Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including dozens of children, after another Israeli soldier was killed in Rafah.\n \n\n   \n  In the current environment – with diplomacy stuck between the first and second phases of the ceasefire – neither Israel nor Hamas is budging.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Hamas’ military wing issued a statement saying that “there is no such term as surrounding or handing oneself over to the enemy.” The Al Qassam Brigades said, “We place the mediators before their responsibilities, and they must find a solution to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire.”\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of a solution, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have clashed with these Hamas cells underground. Twice within just a few hours on Wednesday, the IDF said its troops were operating to “dismantle underground infrastructure” when they identified “four terrorists” in areas occupied by Israel. In both cases, Israeli troops opened fire.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said the actions were in accordance with the US-brokered ceasefire agreement, which allows for the destruction of military and tunnel infrastructure in Gaza. But Hamas views them as a clear violation of the 20-point plan.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu has already come under pressure from Israel’s right-wing to refuse any agreement that will grant the militants safe passage to Hamas-controlled territory. On Tuesday, former Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said on X, “For the terrorists who murdered IDF soldiers after the ceasefire was declared, there must be only two options: surrender and imprisonment or death.”\n \n\n   \n  That political pressure limits Netanyahu’s realistic options for an acceptable solution,  knowing he will face criticism if he is perceived to be giving into Hamas’ demands.\n \n\n   \n  According to the US plan, the Hamas militants could be granted amnesty if they give up their weapons and commit to “peaceful co-existence.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of the underground militants is unlikely to derail the entire ceasefire effort on its own - and the US is investing tremendous effort and political capital in making sure the plan moves forward - but it is one more difficult roadblock for the mediators as they try to sustain the truce.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/jay-clayton-sdny-epstein-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:51:00-05:00","title":"Epstein investigation is latest test for US attorney Jay Clayton","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jay Clayton, President Donald Trump’s appointee to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, is now overseeing a federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged connections with prominent Democrats and financial institutions such as Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, and JPMorgan Chase.

It came hours after Trump directed Bondi, on Truth Social, to investigate Epstein’s relationship with “Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him.”\n \n\n   \n  The assignment is the latest test for a US attorney’s office to carry out Trump’s political desires, further blurring the line that historically separated the White House from the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Alumni of the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York audibly groaned and expressed exasperation at the news of the investigation and potential controversy it will likely bring when contacted by CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Some US attorneys have carried out Trump’s politically driven mission. But not everyone has. Trump’s US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert, a career prosecutor backed by the district judges, resigned under pressure to bring cases against two of Trump’s perceived enemies.\n \n\n   \n  Clayton will now have to manage the politics of the Epstein story, his bosses in Washington, and the prosecutors in the office. It isn’t clear whether Clayton learned of the assignment from the X post or had agreed to take it on.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for SDNY declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  The Southern District, which has long held a reputation for its independence from Washington, will have its independence tested again, but the office is very familiar with the Epstein issue.\n \n\n   \n  SDNY prosecutors during Trump’s first administration prosecuted Epstein and his accomplice and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking minors. They interviewed dozens of survivors and did not find evidence to support charges against anyone else, people familiar with the investigation said.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking girls with Epstein in the early 2000s. She is serving a 20-year sentence. During her interview this summer with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Maxwell did not implicate anyone in sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Geoffrey Berman, who was US attorney for SDNY when it brought charges against Epstein, told CNN’s Jake Tapper in 2022, “The Southern District of New York doesn’t pull punches. And I can assure you if there was a chargeable case against anybody else it would have been brought,” He added, “If the Southern District didn’t bring a case there was no case to be brought.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors also had  sought  to interview Epstein’s long-time friend Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former British prince, who had been accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexual assault, but were rebuffed by his lawyers. The former prince denied any involvement but settled with Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  Clayton, a former partner at New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell who has served on several corporate boards, was selected by Trump earlier this year to lead the office. While the Senate did not advance his nomination, in August, the district judges  voted  for him to serve in the role.  His relationship with Trump dates back several years — they’ve golfed together and Clayton served as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Since taking over SDNY, Clayton has kept a low profile. He assumed the position after the office weathered a public exodus of experienced prosecutors, including the interim US attorney after the Justice Department, who revolted when the Justice Department dropped criminal public corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n \n\n   \n  This summer, Clayton faced his first firestorm when the Justice Department officials in Washington  fired Maurene Comey, an experienced and well-liked prosecutor in the office and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Comey, who was one of the prosecutors who worked on the Epstein and Maxwell investigations, has sued the Justice Department over her termination. Clayton flew to Washington to try unsuccessfully to save her job, one person with knowledge of the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  At a securities regulation conference last week, Clayton used the forum to tout a case aligned with the Trump administration’s agenda, a take-down of drug dealers in New York’s Washington Square Park.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has struggled to tamp down the Epstein story. The House Oversight Committee released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate this week unleashing a wave of headlines. Some Republicans are expected to break ranks and vote next week for a bill calling for the Justice Department to release its Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, DOJ’s Blanche accused Epstein’s estate of hiding documents, which they called “inaccurate.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department hasn’t explained why it directed Clayton to open the investigation into those specific associates of Epstein and JPMorgan Chase.  In July, the FBI and Justice Department  issued a statement  saying they conducted a “systematic review” of the case files and “We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n \n\n   \n  By reopening the investigation, it could give DOJ grounds to stop the public release of its Epstein case files since they may now relate to an ongoing investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Former prosecutors say the statute of limitations has likely run out on any possible crimes other than sex trafficking of minors.  The latest trove of records, which included emails between Epstein and Summers and other emails that reference Trump and Clinton, did not suggest any of them were involved in criminal activity.\n \n\n   \n  Previously JPMorgan Chase was sued for ignoring red flags and continuing to bank with Epstein even as they filed suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department.  The bank terminated the relationship in 2013, several years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023 the bank paid $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein who alleged the financial institution turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions they allege enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. JPMorgan Chase also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase, said, “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks. We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/health/peptides-unregulated-influencers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-05:00","title":"The trend of unproven peptides is spreading through influencers and RFK Jr. allies","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The trend of injecting unapproved peptides—such as BPC-157 and TB-500—is spreading rapidly through social media influencers and allies of Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. , who has built a  national following  among Americans who are deeply skeptical of health experts, pharmaceutical companies and traditional medicine.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the  Food and Drug Administration  has been trying to crack down on the space, sending  warning letters  to clinics that promote the products and adding more than two dozen peptides to a list of ingredients that should not be made by specialty pharmacies that often custom mix the formulations.\n \n\n   \n  That approach may be coming to an end.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has vowed to end “FDA’s war” on peptides and other  alternative treatments  that are embraced by many in his  Make America Healthy Again  movement.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Kennedy’s friends and  associates  are among the biggest proponents, including self-described “biohacker” and “longevity expert” Gary Brecka, who sells peptide injectables, patches and nasal sprays through his website for $350 to $600 each.\n \n\n   \n  In a May appearance on Brecka’s podcast, Kennedy again promised to “end the war at FDA” on peptides,  stem cells ,  psychedelics  and other fringe therapies.\n \n\n   \n  “Music to my ears,” Brecka replied.\n \n\n   \n  Brecka declined to be interviewed for this story.\n \n\n   \n    Peptides are now part of the ‘circus’ of unproven wellness products\n \n\n   \n  Peptides are essentially the building blocks of more complex proteins. Inside the human body, peptides trigger hormones needed for growth, metabolism and healing.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA has approved a number of peptides as medications, including  insulin for diabetics  who don’t naturally produce it and human growth hormone for children with developmental disorders caused by low levels of the hormone.\n \n\n   \n  But many other peptides promoted online have never been approved, making them technically illegal to market as drugs. Under current FDA guidance these peptides also are ineligible for  compounding  — the process in which pharmacies mix made-to-order medications for patients.\n \n\n   \n  That hasn’t stopped celebrities and influencers from touting them.\n \n\n   \n   Joe Rogan , for example, has repeatedly praised BPC-157, a peptide derived from acids found in the gut.\n \n\n   \n  “I had tendonitis in my elbow, I started using BPC-157 and it was gone in two weeks,” Rogan told his podcast audience last year.\n \n\n   \n  He is among the celebrity clients listed on the website of Ways 2 Well, a Texas-based company that offers peptides,  stem cells ,  vitamin infusions  and other alternative treatments.\n \n\n   \n  It’s all part of “the circus of unproven, expensive and possibly dangerous” offerings promoted by  wellness and longevity clinics , said Topol, who has written about the industry.\n \n\n   \n  For $99, Ways 2 Well offers a “peptide consult” with a physician, after which the company ships the peptide vials along with a “full kit with dosing, instructions and syringes,” according to its website.\n \n\n   \n  Company founder Brigham Buhler is a former pharmaceutical sales rep. He did not respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Peptides are often pitched as a ‘natural’ alternative to modern medicine\n \n\n   \n  Andrea Steinbrenner, a consulting executive, said she became intrigued by peptides after hearing about their benefits for “longevity, repair, anti-aging and energy,” from an acquaintance who runs a clinic outside of San Diego.\n \n\n   \n  Steinbrenner and her husband now receive monthly infusions at the clinic, in addition to daily supplements.\n \n\n   \n  “I think peptides are popular right now because we are the aging generation and we are looking for alternatives to modern day medicine,” she said. “I absolutely believe in modern day, western medicine— it’s necessary. But there’s a lot of other things in the universe that the earth supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Peptide proponents often suggest their products are safe because they are based on substances found in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, peptides are naturally recognized by your body,” Brecka told his more than 2 million Instagram followers in February.\n \n\n   \n  Critics point out that the peptides for sale are often imperfect synthetics and are taken at doses much higher than any peptides in the body, raising the risk of allergic reactions and other harms.\n \n\n   \n  Brecka sells more than a half-dozen peptides, including ipamorelin and CJC-1295 — both of which the  FDA has flagged  for serious safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  Like other peptides sold on Brecka’s website, the ipamorelin vials carry the labeling: “research use only.”\n \n\n   \n    Research claims are often a ploy to dodge regulators\n \n\n   \n  The “research use” language is pervasive across the peptide space, even in forums where users trade tips for buying, dosing and “stacking” different drug combinations.\n \n\n   \n  One Facebook group instructs members what words to avoid: “instead of ‘taking’ you are ’researching’ peptides.”\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers who work in the field say the language is an attempt to skirt FDA regulations. The agency does not oversee chemicals that aren’t intended for human use.\n \n\n   \n  It’s often unclear whether such peptides are being produced in the U.S. by pharmacies and mislabeled for research, or whether they are being purchased from chemical manufacturers, many located in China and not subject to FDA drug quality standards.\n \n\n   \n  “Research-grade peptides are going to have junk in them,” said Paul Knoepfler, a cellular biologist at the University of California Davis. “They’re going to have chemicals used in the purification process and fragments of peptides that you don’t want.”\n \n\n   \n  On platforms like TikTok, companies in China and other countries offer to ship dozens of peptide varieties to the U.S. for as little as $5 a vial.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s actually in there?” Knoepfler said. “If someone injects it under their skin, what are they getting?”\n \n\n   \n    FDA has worked to restrict peptides for years\n \n\n   \n  During the  COVID-19 pandemic , the FDA issued over a half-dozen  warning letters  to businesses promoting peptides with “immune-boosting powers.”\n \n\n   \n  Then in 2023, the agency added nearly 20 peptides to a list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety risks. Pharmacies violating the measure risk fines, legal action or potential loss of their state licenses.\n \n\n   \n  That triggered pushback from wellness entrepreneurs and compounding pharmacies, including lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  One coalition, Save Peptides, warned its followers: “Our basic human rights to access alternative medical care using regenerative peptides is being stripped away by the FDA.”\n \n\n   \n  A lawsuit brought by a large compounding pharmacy alleged that regulators had skipped legally required steps when adding peptides to FDA’s list of high-risk substances. The litigation forced the agency to backtrack, and the FDA late last year agreed to convene two public meetings of outside advisers to review several peptides flagged for safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  In each case, the experts agreed with the FDA, voting that the substances were too risky to be compounded.\n \n\n   \n  Some in the industry disagree.\n \n\n   \n  “Physicians should have every available arrow in the quiver to treat illness and, because of the FDA’s inaction, they don’t,” said Lee Rosebush, who helped bring the lawsuit against FDA and represents a group of large compounding pharmacies.\n \n\n   \n    Changes may be coming\n \n\n   \n  The FDA, under Kennedy’s authority, recently removed a number of experts from the compounding advisory panel.\n \n\n   \n  That could pave the way for appointing more peptide-friendly experts who might vote to allow some of the drugs that the FDA previously barred. Alternately, the FDA could simply release a list of peptides and tell pharmacies and clinics that the agency won’t enforce bans against them.\n \n\n   \n  For now, doctors say they are fielding more questions from patients excited about peptides and seeking prescriptions.\n \n\n   \n  “Patients should be really asking their health care professionals: Are these medications safe long term?” says Dr. Anita Gupta of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who served on FDA’s compounding committee until earlier this year. “That’s the question I would ask if I was a patient.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-latino-voters","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"Republicans Have Lost Ground with Latino Voters After Trump’s 2024 Gains","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Trump’s 2024 re-election, which initially showed strong Latino support despite a 38-point deficit in 2016 and 33-point deficit in 2020, his approval among Latino voters has sharply declined, dropping from 41% in early 2024 to just 20% in late 2025.

have lost ground with Latino voters after Trump’s 2024 gains \n       \n  By Edward Wu, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A year after President Donald Trump’s re-election, Republicans are already seeing their gains among Latino voters erode, recent election results and polling suggest. Here’s what’s changed and what it could mean for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    Economic angst drove Latino voters toward the GOP in 2024\n \n\n   \n  Trump made  considerable inroads with Latino voters in 2024 , losing this group by just 5 points nationally after losing by 38 and 33 points in 2016 and 2020, respectively, according to CNN’s 2024 exit poll. Analyses by  Catalist  and the  Pew Research Center  also found a close race among Latinos last year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s relatively strong performance came amid a wave of economic discontent. CNN’s exit poll found that Latino voters were more likely than any other racial or ethnic group to select the economy as their top issue and to describe inflation as a severe or moderate hardship. They were the least likely to say their financial situation had improved since 2020.\n \n\n   \n    Latinos overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump’s second term so far\n \n\n   \n  Many Latinos entered Trump’s second term feeling optimistic. Over half approved of his handling of the presidential transition in a December 2024 CNN poll, a similar proportion described themselves as enthusiastic or optimistic about his second term, and 72% expressed at least some confidence in his ability to handle the economy.\n \n\n   \n  But in  CNN’s latest poll , just 20% of Latinos approved of his job performance, down from 41% in February. This 21-point drop far outpaces the 4- and 9-point drops among Black and White Americans and the 10-point drop in his approval rating overall.  Several   other   polls  have also found Trump’s approval rating among Latinos declining from the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  This drop in approval comes as Latinos continue to be focused on the economy: In the late October poll, 54% say the economy and cost of living is the nation’s top issue (compared to 47% for Americans overall) .  Latinos are more likely than Americans overall to rate economic conditions as somewhat or very poor (81%, compared to 72% of all Americans) and to say Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions (75%, compared to 61% of all Americans).\n \n\n   \n  Latinos are also likelier than the general population to say that immigration is extremely or very important to them (77% said so in CNN’s late summer poll, compared to 65% of Americans overall). From July to October, the proportion of Latinos who say that Trump has gone too far on deportations has gone up from 66% to 79%.\n \n\n   \n  Since March, the Republican Party’s favorability rating among Latinos has dropped from 26% to 16%, while the Democratic Party’s rating has mostly held steady, going from 37% to 34%. And by late summer, Latinos gave Democrats a 10-point advantage on economic issues, up from a near-even split in May.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump “received historic support from Latino voters in the 2024 election” and was beginning to fulfill his promises on the economy and immigration.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has consistently outperformed the mainstream media’s so-called polling, and he will continue doing so by delivering for everyday Americans,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats won Latinos in this month’s elections by wide margins\n \n\n   \n  In the first opportunity for millions of Americans to weigh in on Trump’s second term, Latinos supported Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey respectively, by at least a 2-to-1 margin, according to CNN’s exit poll. Latinos also voted for a Democratic-supported redistricting ballot measure in California 71% to 29%.\n \n\n   \n  There have been questions about Democrats’ ability to win back Latino voters given their own popularity issues. (CNN’s most recent polling found that more Latinos view the party unfavorably than favorably.)   The Latinos who voted in the November 2025 contests generally held favorable views of the Democratic Party – 56% in California and Virginia and 67% in New Jersey said they viewed the party favorably.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats were also better able than Republicans to win over Latino voters who viewed their respective parties negatively. Voters in California who viewed both parties negatively supported the Democratic-backed ballot measure 78% to 21%. In Virginia and New Jersey, just 2% of Latino voters who held a negative view of the Republican Party supported Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican gubernatorial candidates, while over a third who held a negative view of the Democratic Party across the two contests cast votes for the Democratic candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats’ strong performance among Latinos on November 4 was not solely the result of more Democratic-leaning Latino voters turning out. Mirroring the Latino disillusionment with Trump’s presidency, Latino Trump voters also appear to have defected from Trump at higher rates than the overall electorate.\n \n\n   \n  Among Latino voters who turned out in the November 2025 elections and said they had supported Trump last year, 24% in California voted for the Democratic-supported ballot measure and 18% in New Jersey supported Sherrill. The defection rates were considerably lower among all Trump voters who turned out in 2025: 12% in California supported the ballot measure and 7% in New Jersey voted for Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n    What this year’s results could mean for 2026\n \n\n   \n  While the 2025 contests represent a relatively narrow and Democratic-leaning playing field, early polling on the 2026 midterms also shows Democrats gaining ground. CNN’s October poll found that Latino registered voters say, 64% to 19%, that they’d prefer a Democratic congressional candidate over a Republican one. And 60% say there’s no chance they’d consider supporting a Republican candidate, while just 19% say they’ve ruled out backing a Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  An  October Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll  found a narrower but still substantial lead for Democrats among Latino voters – in that poll, 52% said they’d prefer a Democratic congressional candidate and 35% a Republican one.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s latest polling suggests that Democrats are currently holding onto more Latino voters who chose Democrat Kamala Harris last year than Republicans are holding onto Latino Trump voters. Among non-Latino voters, Democrats and Republicans are holding onto similar shares of their party’s voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/china/china-japan-taiwan-takaichi-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:04:00-05:00","title":"China warns citizens against Japan travel as Taiwan spat escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has issued a formal travel advisory warning its citizens against visiting Japan in response to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s controversial claim that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival, prompting Beijing to escalate diplomatic and economic actions.

Even as it may be more symbolic than anything, the move suggests Beijing is willing to wield its economic heft to press geopolitical points, a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  Recent “blatantly provocative remarks on Taiwan” have “further damaged the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges… creating additional risks to the safety and security of Chinese citizens in Japan,” a statement published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The ministry and its missions “remind Chinese citizens to refrain from visiting Japan for the time being,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Following the announcement, a number of Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern on Saturday published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Beijing is its latest show of outrage in a  roughly week-long row  after Takaichi, in response to a question in Japan’s parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  China’s Ministry of Defense on Friday separately warned that Japan would “suffer a crushing defeat” if it dared to intervene militarily in the Taiwan Strait.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  The travel advisory follows official protest from both sides related to the incident – with each country summoning the other’s ambassador – and a surge of vitriolic backlash against Takaichi from within China, where nationalist, anti-Japanese sentiment has been on the rise in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The falling-out comes less than two weeks after Takaichi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for the first time on the sidelines of an international summit and agreed to pursue constructive, stable ties.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A heavy price’\n \n\n   \n  The backlash was kicked off by China’s Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian, who last Saturday shared a news article about Takaichi’s remarks and commented “the dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  State media has since published a barrage of scathing commentaries and editorials, while rampant social media discussion has disparaged Takaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  A commentary from the People’s Liberation Army Daily published Saturday attacked Takaichi and said if Japan intervened militarily in the Taiwan Strait, China would give it a “head-on blow.” A PLA-affiliated X account also circulated comments translated into Japanese warning Japan would “pay a heavy price” in such a case.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo on Friday summoned China’s ambassador to Japan to protest Xue’s “highly inappropriate remarks” and demand Beijing take “appropriate actions,” its foreign ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing had a day prior summoned Japan’s ambassador to China, in a meeting where Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong said Takaichi’s comments had “seriously damaged the political foundation of China-Japan relations,” and slammed Japan for not retracting them.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Friday said there was no need to retract Takaichi’s comments, stressing that they were made within the context of a discussion on an “existential crisis situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Separately on Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important not only for Japan’s security but also for the stability of the international community.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Takaichi said her remarks were “hypothetical” and that she would refrain from making similar comments in parliament again.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, which is widely seen as aiming to establish itself as the dominant power in the region, looks warily at the American alliance with Japan when it comes to its own regional security and ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has called for closer security ties with the US and last month moved to accelerate the country’s defense build-up, but like previous Japanese prime ministers she must balance the country’s close economic ties to China.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Junko Ogura contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/climate/iceland-warming-current-amoc-collapse-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Iceland Declares AMOC Collapse a National Security Threat","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iceland has declared the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) a national security threat, recognizing it as an 'existential' risk due to its profound implications for climate, economy, and national survival.

This country just declared it a national security threat \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iceland’s relatively mild climate is shaped by a crucial network of currents that winds its away around the Atlantic Ocean transporting heat northward — without it, the island would be much icier and stormier. As evidence mounts these currents  could be on course for collapse , Iceland’s government has made the unusual move of designating the risk a national security threat, prompting a a high-level response into how to prepare for this “existential threat.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our climate, economy and security are deeply tied to the stability of the ocean currents around us,” said Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Iceland’s Minister for Environment, Energy and Climate.\n \n\n   \n  The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation — known as the AMOC — is a looping system of currents that works like a giant conveyor belt, pulling warm water from the Southern Hemisphere and tropics to the Northern Hemisphere, where it cools, sinks and flows back south.\n \n\n   \n  When scientists are asked which potential climate impact terrifies them most, the collapse of the AMOC is often top of the list.\n \n\n   \n  A growing body of research points to the AMOC slowing down, as higher global temperatures disrupt the delicate balance of heat and salinity on which its strength relies. The science is still unsettled on the likelihood and timing of any collapse, but some studies have projected it could be on course to happen  this century .\n \n\n   \n  A shutdown of the AMOC “cannot be considered a low likelihood risk anymore in view of the evolving science over the past years,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer and climatologist who has studied the AMOC at Potsdam University in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  The  impacts would be catastrophic  — ushering in huge global weather and climate shifts, including rising sea levels in parts of the US and Europe, disrupted monsoon systems affecting countries in Asia and Africa, and a winter deep freeze in Europe, with sea ice potentially creeping southward as far as the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  Iceland “would be close to the center of a serious regional cooling,” meaning the country could be surrounded by sea ice, Rahmstorf told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an “an existential threat,” Jóhannsson told CNN. The AMOC regulates Iceland’s weather, and its collapse could devastate infrastructure, transport and vital industries including fishing, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jóhannsson briefed the government on the latest science after  research  published in August raised “grave concerns” about the AMOC’s future stability. In September, Iceland’s National Security Council designated the current’s potential collapse as a national security risk, marking the first time a climate impact has received this designation in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The decision “reflects the seriousness of the issue and ensures that the matter gets the attention it deserves,” Jóhannsson said. In practice, the designation will mean a high-level, coordinated government response to understand the threat and work out how to prevent and mitigate the worst consequences, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rahmstorf commended Iceland for its decision and said other countries should follow suit. The impacts of an AMOC collapse would be felt across the globe. Scientists are trying to understand the full range of potential impacts on societies and economies, but research has pointed to  destroyed crops  and  catastrophic flooding .\n \n\n   \n  Iceland’s decision marks a shift in how the country understands climate risks, Jóhannsson said.\n \n\n   \n  “What we do know is that the current climate might change so drastically that it could become impossible for us to adapt,” he said. “In short, this is not just a scientific concern — it’s a matter of national survival and security.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/uk/trump-bbc-apology-sue-billion-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:18:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he will sue the BBC despite broadcaster’s apology","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump has announced plans to sue the BBC for between $1 billion and $5 billion, claiming that a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' inaccurately edited a speech from the January 6 Capitol attack, implying he said he would 'walk with them' and 'fight like hell'.

AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump says he intends to sue the BBC for between $1 billion and $5 billion “probably sometime next week” despite the broadcaster’s apology to him over a documentary Trump’s lawyers described as defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  “I think I have to do it,” Trump told reporters. “They’ve even admitted that they cheated … They cheated, they changed the words coming out of my mouth.”\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the BBC  apologized to Trump  over an editing blunder in an October 2024 documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?,” saying that it “sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the BBC has rejected the defamation claim and is refusing to pay compensation. The controversy has sparked a crisis in the BBC, triggering the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to UK network GB News, Trump acknowledged the apology he received from the BBC, saying “they wrote me a nice letter.”\n \n\n   \n  “’We apologize,’ but when you say it’s unintentional, I guess if it’s unintentional, you don’t apologize,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The president told GB News he is not looking to get into lawsuits but painted the move as essential to prevent similar mishaps in the future.\n \n\n   \n  “This was so egregious,” he said, “If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people… I’d like to find out why they did it.”\n \n\n   \n    Plans to call the UK PM\n \n\n   \n  In the BBC’s edit, on an edition of the TV show Panorama, different parts of Trump’s speech from the day of the January 6 storming of the US Capitol were spliced together, creating the impression Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  He told GB News: “I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement.”\n \n\n   \n  The president said Friday he plans to call UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the coming days to discuss the spat with the BBC, claiming the prime minister is “very embarrassed” about the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Should Trump proceed with his case and win it would impose enormous financial burdens on the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is primarily license-fee funded, meaning anyone watching live television in the UK or who accesses BBC content online must pay a compulsory charge. The BBC’s income is further supplemented by commercial subsidiaries.\n \n\n   \n  According to the  BBC’s most recent operational report,  in the year ending March 2025 the BBC’s total income was £5.9 billion (more than $7.5 billion.) The license fee raised £3.8 billion (around $5 billion) - 65% of the BBC’s revenue in that year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump previously threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump said he wants the BBC to “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused, the UK’s strict limitations on defamation cases mean the president cannot take legal action in the courts of England and Wales, as the purported wrongdoing happened more than 12 months ago.\n \n\n   \n  If he wishes to pursue his claim, Trump’s only option is to do so in US courts. But this process will not be simple. In the US, the president will be expected to present a high standard of compelling evidence proving his reputation was materially damaged because of the BBC’s edit.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuking Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s grounds to reject Trump’s defamation claim, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip was never meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Billy Stockwell and Laura Sharman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/us/gabrielle-terrelonge-missing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Florida Girl Disappears After Last Seen on Bus with Mother; Mom Arrested on Child Neglect Charges","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 10-year-old girl, Gabrielle Terrelonge, was last seen on June 30, 2025, on a Greyhound bus with her mother, Passha Davis, traveling from Broward County to Orlando, where they arrived at the Florida Mall.

Now the mom is in jail as police investigate her disappearance \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Gordon Terrelonge says it has been more than six months since he has seen or heard from his 10-year-old daughter, Gabrielle Terrelonge.\n \n\n   \n  He lost touch with Gabrielle and her mom, Passha Davis, this past spring after a dispute with Davis in Kissimmee, Florida, but said he expected his family would eventually reunite.\n \n\n   \n  However, when Terrelonge discovered in online jail records in late October that Davis had been arrested in the South Florida city of Margate, he contacted Margate police to ask who was caring for Gabrielle.\n \n\n   \n  It was then, Gordon Terrelonge says, that he and police learned at the same time: Gabrielle was missing.\n \n\n   \n  “My life has been hell,” Terrelonge told CNN this week. “This is the longest I’ve gone without seeing her.”\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle was not with Davis when the mom, after being accused of shoplifting, was arrested October 17, and Davis still was in a Broward County jail when Terrelonge called, police said. That call sparked an investigation by Florida police and  the FBI , who are  seeking the public’s help  in finding Gabrielle.\n \n\n   \n  As far as investigators know, the girl was last seen with Davis on June 30 taking a Greyhound bus from Broward County to Orlando, Margate police Maj. Al Banatte said. A witness on the bus saw them arrive at the Florida Mall, and “the manifest and tickets also corroborate this information,” Banatte said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis, who was re-arrested this month in connection with Gabrielle’s disappearance, told police she doesn’t know where her daughter is and “that she should be with her father,” according to the arrest affidavit. But Margate police say Terrelonge last saw Gabrielle in Kissimmee in April – when investigators believe Davis left that city with the child – and that Terrelonge is cooperating with the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle’s disappearance has left her family reeling and desperate for answers about her whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  “This is very devastating for me,” Gabrielle’s paternal grandmother, Jonett Vassel, told CNN over the phone as she hung flyers in Orlando with her granddaughter’s picture on them. “I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I’m fasting, I’m praying. I’m still trusting God, because I’m a Christian, so I’m trusting that he will bring her home.”\n \n\n   \n  Police and court records paint a picture of an unstable living situation for both Davis and Gabrielle since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Davis was homeless and suffered from “mental illness and substance abuse issues,” police said in her November arrest affidavit. Yet Gabrielle was in Davis’ care, and they moved from city to city in Florida last year and parts of this year, staying with family members, at hotels and even sleeping in a car, Margate police said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ October arrest came after she was accused of shoplifting at a Dollar Tree in Margate. The store declined to prosecute, but police arrested her on charges of resisting a police officer without violence and providing false identification while being lawfully detained, records show.\n \n\n   \n  She posted bail on October 31 but was re-arrested by Margate police on November 4 and charged with child neglect in Gabrielle’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Davis “failed to provide any reasonable explanation as to the whereabouts of her minor child” and “failed to provide adequate services and supervision necessary to maintain her physical and mental health,” police allege in a court document.\n \n\n   \n  During Davis’ November 5 bond hearing in the child neglect case, a defense attorney told a Broward County judge that Davis had told him “she is innocent of these charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “She’s wanting to fight these allegations,” the defense attorney said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis is represented by the Broward County public defender’s office, court records show, and CNN has sought comment from that office. Davis is being held at a county jail with bond set at $100,000.\n \n\n   \n  In an arraignment Monday relating to the first arrest, Davis told a judge she had mental illness. The judge ordered that Davis be evaluated for competency by November 26.\n \n\n   \n    A rocky living situation\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle was last enrolled in school in Port St. Lucie, Florida, when she and Davis lived with Gabrielle’s paternal aunt there from April 2024 to November 2024, Banatte said. Sometime after Thanksgiving last year, Davis and Gabrielle left the aunt’s house for a Motel 6, Margate police said.\n \n\n   \n  This March, they were found sleeping in a car in Broward County, Margate police said. The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) intervened and helped Davis and Gabrielle travel to Orlando, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DCF to inquire about the encounter, including why the agency helped them go to Orlando, whether DCF was aware of Gabrielle’s school enrollment status, and whether the state considered removing the child from Davis’ custody.\n \n\n   \n  Between mid-March and April, Davis and the child were with Gordon Terrelonge in the Orlando and Kissimmee areas, Margate police said. But after the April dispute in Kissimmee, Terrelonge said, he never saw Gabrielle again.\n \n\n   \n    A father’s desperate plea\n \n\n   \n  Terrelonge described Gabrielle as a joyful child who is adventurous and loves nature, coloring, wearing princess costumes and having tea parties.\n \n\n   \n  He said Gabrielle and Davis shared a close bond, and even when times were tough, Gabrielle preferred to be with her mother over anyone else.  Terrelonge said his attempts to get full legal custody of Gabrielle were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  He said he had lost touch with Davis and Gabrielle in the past, but they would always find their way back to each other within a few months.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always in and out,” Terrelonge said of Davis. “But I always end up finding them.”\n \n\n   \n  Terrelonge said he has followed all leads for possible places where Gabrielle could be. He said he wants to believe that Gabrielle is safe, but he worries that someone could have harmed her.\n \n\n   \n  “If anyone knows anything, please come forward and let us know,” Terrelonge said. “You may save my child’s life.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Taylor Galgano and Lily Hautau contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/business/tariffs-trump-taco-affordability","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00+00:00","title":"Trump’s latest tariff TACO probably won’t make your life more affordable","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed several tariffs on agricultural imports, including coffee, beef, and certain fruits, in a move informally labeled 'TACO' (Trump Always Chickens Out), reflecting a pattern of policy retreats amid public backlash and economic concerns.

November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Americans could soon see some goods get cheaper after President Donald Trump exempted certain agricultural imports from a set of tariffs on Friday. But any price drops likely won’t be enough to make life feel more affordable any time soon.\n \n\n   \n  The executive order  exempted products like coffee, beef and some fruit  from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which began rolling out in April.\n \n\n   \n  The new exemptions are part of what traders have dubbed TACO, or Trump Always Chickens Out, to describe times when the president backs off a policy after unintended consequences pop up. In the case of tariffs, Trump has already reversed a number of his measures, a sign that the administration  is reshaping his signature economic tool .\n \n\n   \n  The latest TACO comes after voters, worried about affordability,  gave Republicans a drubbing  in recent off-year elections.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the new exemptions generally won’t help improve affordability.\n \n\n   \n  “It depends on what the importers do with the tariff,” he said in a CNBC interview on Friday. “So when you look at the overall price trend, it hasn’t been because of tariffs. It’s been because of these other events going on and just supply and demand.”\n \n\n   \n  But in cases where tariffs have been passed along to consumers, prices could drop, Greer said.\n \n\n   \n  One potential example: bananas. American consumers are paying about 8% more for bananas than before Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  The US largely imports bananas from South American countries. With bananas exempt from “reciprocal” tariffs that started at 10%, prices could go back to where they were earlier this year, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. But it’s unlikely to be something most consumers notice unless they’re buying bananas often, she added.\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone is convinced it will even do that much.\n \n\n   \n  “It is not clear that lowering tariffs will lower prices — it depends on what retailers think they can get away with. The import price of bananas has fallen since tariffs were imposed, but the US consumer price has risen,” Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS global wealth management, said in a note last week. (The United States tracks import prices before accounting for tariffs. In some cases, import prices have fallen as exporters lower what they charge as a way to share in the tariff expense importers pay.)\n \n\n   \n    Make America more affordable?\n \n\n   \n  The White House has ramped up its efforts to convince voters that affordability issues are just a hangover from former President Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  “Putting Joe Biden’s inflation crisis firmly behind us has been a priority for President Trump since Day One, when he signed an array of executive orders to slash costly regulations and unleash American energy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  But economists generally agree that Trump’s tariffs aren’t making matters better.\n \n\n   \n  And while prices normally fluctuate, especially for food, they generally get more expensive over time, House said. “That’s why this isn’t going to, I think, cure consumers’ angst about elevated prices,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/justice-jackson-snap-fight","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Justice Jackson goes ‘her own way’ in Supreme Court’s SNAP fight","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the least senior justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, handled the emergency appeal over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding dispute by granting President Donald Trump’s request for an administrative stay.

John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As she oversaw President Donald Trump’s emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, case this past week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson once again proved she isn’t beholden to Supreme Court custom.\n \n\n   \n  The least senior justice, who has been the court’s most  consistent critic of the second Trump administration , appeared to be sending signals not only about the technicalities of the SNAP case but also more subtle messages about the way the court has handled a litany of short-fuse appeals on its emergency docket this year dealing with presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  She did all that, oddly enough,  by siding with Trump .\n \n\n   \n  “She’s modeling the way that the emergency docket should be used,” said Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.\n \n\n   \n  Since joining the court three years ago, Jackson has drawn attention for a sharp pen. That has been particularly notable   in   a series of cutting dissents she has written this year calling out the Trump administration for what she has framed as “ lawlessness .” And she has not spared her colleagues for acquiescing to the White House in some of those decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote in August when the court allowed the  Trump administration to halt about $800 million  in research grants. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”\n \n\n   \n  That pointed prose and her unflinching willingness to criticize her colleagues   has made Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by former President Joe Biden, a divisive figure.\n \n\n   \n  “Even before the SNAP case, Justice Jackson had already emerged as the most vocal, most frequent, and sharpest critic of the majority’s inconsistent, difficult-to-justify, and often unjustified behavior in Trump-related cases,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  Her machinations in the case, Vladeck said, underscored “a justice who is using every possible strategic and tactical maneuver behind the scenes to try to push the court toward what she believes the right answer is, but who is unafraid of sending increasingly loud public signals when those efforts are, as they so often have been this year, ultimately for naught.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal on funding for SNAP emerged as the highest-profile legal case of the government shutdown. A lower court  ordered the US Department of Agriculture  to transfer $4 billion from another fund to pay full SNAP benefits for November – an order that the administration appealed as an overreach of judicial power.\n \n\n   \n  With a midnight deadline approaching – and benefits for more than 40 million Americans hanging in the balance – the case landed in a rush at the Supreme Court on a Friday evening. Trump wanted the justices to temporarily block the lower court order, known as a “stay.”\n \n\n   \n  Because she handles emergency appeals from the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, the case went to Jackson. The “circuit justice” generally plays a straightforward role, setting a briefing schedule and – in big cases – ultimately referring the matter to the full court.   \n \n\n   \n  But as he has raced up to the Supreme Court this year in case after case, Trump has been asking for something else as well: An even shorter-term order known as an “administrative stay,” which freezes the lower court decision while the justices review the written arguments in the case.\n \n\n   \n  That administrative decision, usually, rests with the assigned justice – in this case, Jackson.\n \n\n   \n  A former trial court judge who recently took up boxing as a way to relieve stress, Jackson  ultimately granted Trump’s request , a move that initially raised anxiety among liberals and cheers from conservatives on social media. But Jackson also took several steps that were a departure from how other justices have handled administrative stays.\n \n\n   \n  First, Jackson included a few paragraphs of written explanation in her order, breaking from the   boilerplate-only language usually found in administrative stays. She wrote that she was granting Trump’s request “to facilitate” the appeals court’s “expeditious resolution” of the appeal.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court has faced enormous criticism this year for regularly overturning lower court orders on its emergency docket without explanation. While there are  sometimes good reasons  for brevity in those cases, some justices – such as Justice Elena Kagan – have said the court could  provide a little more explanation .\n \n\n   \n  Second, rather than leaving the timing open-ended, Jackson set her administrative order to lift 48 hours after the appeals court ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson likely understood – or at least assumed – there would be a majority to grant Trump’s request if she didn’t do so. By granting it herself but limiting the timeline, rather than sending it to the full court, she had the effect of bringing the case back to her chambers for a second look in an unusually short order, Vladeck wrote in  widely circulated post  over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Wydra said Jackson handled the case as should be done on the emergency docket. Justices, she said, should deal with the requests “quickly, as transparently as possible, and for logistical reasons, not…make what amount to significant substantive decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston who also wrote about Jackson’s maneuvers, agreed that she appeared to be going “her own way.”\n \n\n   \n  “She has a clear vision of how she wants the shadow docket to be run,” Blackman said.\n \n\n   \n  But, he suggested, it ultimately didn’t work. In the end, as Congress  drew closer to an agreement  to fund the government, the full court extended her administrative stay for a few days without writing to explain why. Jackson wound up in dissent, which she also registered without explanation. And the Trump administration ultimately got what it wanted.    \n \n\n   \n   Trump signed the spending measure  late Wednesday, reopening the federal government and funding the food program. Hours later, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the Supreme Court noting that it was abandoning its appeal – an anticlimactic end to a case that had significant real-world consequences.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, as the court announced it was reopening its doors to the public, a single line was added to the docket in the SNAP appeal: “Application withdrawn.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/travel/travel-news-most-beautiful-village-france","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"France is the world’s favorite country to visit, but this is the village the French like best","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France remains the world’s most visited country, with 100 million international tourists in 2023, celebrated for its cultural and culinary traditions.

  \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This week in travel: The world’s best cheese and plenty of delicious bread to pair with it, another Italian town offering sweet deals to new residents, plus a medieval village in France that earns top scores from the French.\n \n\n   \n    France’s favorite village\n \n\n   \n  France has for some years been the  world’s most visited country , with a record 100 million international tourists going there last year to enjoy its culture, food and scenery. In 2022, a Belgian man even cycled 870 miles just to taste a  very special croissant  in Nice.\n \n\n   \n  But which destination in France is a favorite among the French? Earlier this year, viewers of the TV show  “Le Village Préféré des Français 2025”  chose Saint Antoine l’Abbaye as France’s favorite village for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  So what’s the appeal? This medieval village with cobbled streets and a stunning abbey is tucked away among green rolling hills between Grenoble and Lyon in the southeastern department of Isère. Vercors Regional Natural Park is on the village’s doorstep and the whole place bustles with performers, music, shows and stalls for the medieval festival held each year in the first week of August.\n \n\n   \n  The hanging cliffside houses of Pont-en-Royans are 14 miles away and the town of Saint-Marcellin, famous for its delicate creamy cheese, is just an eight-mile drive.\n \n\n   \n    The world’s best cheese and Germany’s best bread\n \n\n   \n  France is rightly celebrated for its cheeses, from Comté to Camembert, but it was an aged Swiss Gruyère that was anointed the finest on the planet at the World Cheese Awards in Switzerland on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Three cheeses on, we could still taste it,” was the conclusion of English judge Perry Wakeman, describing its “fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 5,200 cheeses from 46 countries were gathered for the judging at Bern’s Festhalle venue, the pageant queens growing ever more pungent as the day wore on. CNN was there for all the  sights and smells .\n \n\n   \n  Moving from cheese to bread, the iconic French baguette has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as “250 grams of magic and perfection,” but all is not well in this world of flour and yeast. Even though UNESCO has deemed the baguette an essential cultural icon, France’s bread consumption is plummeting, with the daily trip to the boulangerie a disappearing way of life. Here’s how the  humble bread baton  is facing its uncertain future.\n \n\n   \n  France isn’t the only European country whose loaves have received UNESCO heritage status, however. German bread culture made the Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2015 and the country has more than 3,200 officially recognized types of bread. A nutty little number named Nussbrot was named Germany’s  bread of the year  for 2025.\n \n\n   \n    New life in the Old World\n \n\n   \n  Debra and Eric Stillwell, both in their 60s, relocated from Burbank, California, to  France’s Dordogne Valley  five years ago. The medieval towns, castles and landscapes were what lured them, Eric tells CNN.\n \n\n   \n  As retirees, they find the cost of living easier on their budget. “Everybody thinks that Americans living in France are all rich, and that’s not true,” says Eric. “Our house cost 70,000 euros… We aren’t rich.”\n \n\n   \n  Next door in Italy,   the picturesque village of Radicondoli, in Tuscany, has a relocation plan  offering up to $23,000  to anyone willing to buy and live in one of its vacant homes, along with   an extra roughly $7,000 in   contributions towards expenses like heating and transport.\n \n\n   \n    A seafood feast in Marseille\n \n\n   \n  Actor Tony Shalhoub is on a mission to find the world’s best, most surprising food items for under $10. That money nets him a seafood feast in the French port city of Marseille. Watch the final two episodes of CNN Original Series “ Tony Shalhoub Breaking Bread ,” beginning Saturday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CNN and stream the entire series next day for subscribers of  CNN All Access .\n \n\n   \n    In case you missed it\n \n\n   \n  The US government shutdown is over.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what travelers need to know about  Thanksgiving flights .\n \n\n   \n  There’s a  dolphin  living in the Venice canals.\n \n\n   \n  And pressure is growing to release  penguins  “trapped” in London.\n \n\n   \n  She arrived in New York anticipating a movie moment.\n \n\n   \n  Then she met the  man of her dreams .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/breaking-down-the-looming-house-vote-on-the-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-05:00","title":"Breaking down the looming House vote on the Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote on a discharge petition demanding the release of full Jeffrey Epstein case files, a move that has been delayed for months by Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump.

He later kept the House out of session for an extraordinarily long time during the shutdown. This carried the benefit – whether it was the express purpose or not – of giving him an excuse not to swear in the decisive 218th member to force the vote.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump, too, clearly did not want this vote. He waged an unsuccessful  11th-hour campaign  on Wednesday to flip the handful of Republicans who signed the “discharge petition.”\n \n\n   \n  But the vote now looms, with Johnson announcing plans to schedule it for next week.  So, what happens next? What could the vote mean? And what are the political dynamics?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hardly the end of the road, but it’s clearly a significant moment that could set the Epstein saga off on a new trajectory.\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that, despite the pushback, this vote isn’t really the destination. It’s not like the House passes the bill, and suddenly the Justice Department releases the full Epstein case files. The bill would still need to be passed by the Senate and signed by the president.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s clearly a reason Johnson and the administration didn’t want the vote. The fear here seems to be that it 1) creates a very difficult decision for many Republican congressmembers, and it 2) could apply pressure on the Senate and the administration to follow suit – particularly if it passes by a large margin in the House.\n \n\n   \n  And the large margin appears to be what many are anticipating. CNN reported this week that House GOP leadership is expecting mass defections. The lead GOP co-sponsor of the discharge petition, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, isn’t exactly lowering expectations, either. He has  set a threshold for success at two-thirds  of the House, or nearly 290 votes, if all members are present.That’s the point at which enough members support the measure that it could overcome a presidential veto.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are somehow able to get two-thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president,” Massie told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That would indeed be a very symbolic victory. It would not only demonstrate that a wide, bipartisan majority of the House wants the files released, but it would suggest the chamber could actually override Trump’s attempt to block that – whether or not it would ever come to that.\n \n\n   \n  It would require about 75 out of the 219 House Republicans, if every Democrat voted in favor.\n \n\n   \n  Several Republicans have already said they will vote for the bill, despite not having supported Massie’s discharge petition. (Only four Republicans signed the petition.)\n \n\n   \n  And we’re also seeing how this all could start to register in the Senate, with Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana quickly signaling Thursday that the GOP should just go for full transparency. Kennedy had previously voted against an early effort by Senate Democrats to force the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t think this issue is going to go away until that issue is addressed and answered to the American people’s satisfaction,” Kennedy  told CNN’s Kasie Hunt . “And I may end up with  a sombrero on my head  for saying that, but that’s the way I see it.”\n \n\n   \n  These House members clearly face a difficult vote, with compelling dynamics pushing them in both directions.\n \n\n   \n  Among the dynamics pushing them to vote no are loyalty to Trump, which is the coin of the realm in today’s GOP. Trump has made it very clear that he will remember how these members vote.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” Trump  posted Wednesday on social media . He added that there “should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else.”\n \n\n   \n  Voting for the bill would be a significant rebuke of Trump and Johnson, who explicitly fought against this. It would suggest that the other measures taken – such as the House Oversight Committee’s release of some Epstein materials obtained from his estate – just weren’t good enough. Congressional Republicans  almost never buck Trump  like this.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leadership also has reason to try and limit defections, because of the level of pressure it could apply to the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  But on the other side are plenty of dynamics pressuring members to vote for the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The big one is how they would explain the vote to their constituents. The fact is that Americans overwhelmingly want all the files, they’re upset with the lack of transparency thus far, and they expect that the files contain significant information.\n \n\n   \n  Fully 77% of Americans wanted all the files released, as long as victims’ names are redacted, according to an  NPR-PBS-Marist College poll  in September. An earlier  CBS News-YouGov poll  showed 89% said the government should release all its information.\n \n\n   \n  Other  polling  has shown overwhelming majorities of Americans think damaging information about powerful people is contained in the files and that the government hasn’t been transparent enough.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, voting against releasing the records risks making you look like you’re part of a cover-up – a cover-up for pedophilia. And what if the stuff is actually going to come out anyway, and maybe even includes some significant information? Who wants to be one of the people who voted against that transparency?\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at another key dynamic here. At some point, Republicans who once upon a time led the charge to release the Epstein files – at least until the Trump administration reversed itself this summer – might just reason this is going to happen the easy way or the hard way.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Annie Grayer and Kristen Holmes  reported  Friday on a Trump ally on Capitol Hill who told the president directly that they questioned the strategy to keep delaying and downplaying things.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Trump, who hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, in many ways  seems to be seeding suspicion  about what the files might show about his own proximity to the convicted sex offender by fighting the transparency that his administration once promised. (Trump on Friday did push for  more investigation  into Epstein’s ties to high-profile figures — but that probe could be a further obstacle to a possible release of the DOJ’s files.)\n \n\n   \n  At some point, lawmakers might resent that the administration has so mishandled all of this, and view this vote as a chance to force the issue and hopefully get beyond all of it, after months of it looming over their heads.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the case, it’ll be one of the more fascinating votes in a long time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/us/ice-federal-agents-immigration-force","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"As ICE escalates its tactics, are federal agents truly ‘untouchable’ in the eyes of the law?","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines growing concerns over the accountability of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents under the Trump administration, where federal agents have been accused of excessive use of force during arrests and public confrontations.

Bill Essayli wrote in  a social media post.  “Using it against law enforcement justifies their use of deadly force in self-defense.”\n \n\n   \n  Essayli alleged the man who was shot had rammed his car into vehicles driven by immigration agents trying to arrest him, “causing agents to worry for their safety,” and prompting one of them to discharge his weapon, wounding the man and, inadvertently, a deputy US marshal.\n \n\n   \n  Under policy, immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. Still, federal law enforcement agencies have historically spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent’s use of force was appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  But after recent high-profile use of force encounters, federal officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents, raising questions about whether previously enshrined mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been all but abandoned in President Donald Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely due to Trump’s installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI – the agencies traditionally tasked with investigating and prosecuting suspected civil rights violations by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  And since many immigration agents typically  do not wear body cameras  — a point of contention that has at times led to intense friction among the enforcers themselves — there has often been scant ability to verify competing narratives following use of force incidents.\n \n\n   \n  “If it’s purely the ICE agent’s word against someone else, game over,” one federal law enforcement source said. “Unless it’s beyond egregious and on film, they are basically untouchable.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Allowed to do whatever the hell they want’\n \n\n   \n  In August, Trump himself effectively gave American law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances. In announcing  the federal takeover of the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department , the president lamented images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers.\n \n\n   \n  “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”’ and they can hit real hard,”  Trump said . “And they’re standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything.”\n \n\n   \n  “But now,” he added,﻿ “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”\n \n\n   \n  A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump’s immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN. Many are concerned DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security have grown less willing to objectively scrutinize the actions of agents and ensure their rigorous adherence to the Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Following  a recent purge of career DOJ employees , sources also worry that federal prosecutors responsible for evaluating the conduct of agents will choose not to investigate questionable incidents for fear of running afoul of Trump’s political priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a zero chance of an (immigration) agent being criminally charged with this administration,” said one senior DOJ lawyer who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They must be held accountable’\n \n\n   \n  While the Justice Department has vociferously defended the actions of immigration agents, state and local officials in some jurisdictions have pushed back, threatening to find ways of holding accountable federal agents accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law,”  Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi  said in a statement last month before Trump called off a planned surge of immigration agents to her San Francisco district.\n \n\n   \n  The former House speaker was backed up by the local district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, who said on social media, “If a federal agent breaks the law, they must be held accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago has been another flashpoint, where clashes between agents and the public have spurred numerous allegations of excessive use of force.\n \n\n   \n  A Presbyterian minister said he was praying outside a suburban ICE facility during demonstrations there last month when he was  struck in the head by pepper balls . Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the protesters had blocked an ICE vehicle from leaving the facility and threw rocks and bottles and launched fireworks at agents – a claim the pastor disputed.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents have also faced scrutiny in the Windy City after text messages  appeared to show an agent bragging  about his marksmanship skills after shooting a driver accused of ramming the agent’s vehicle five times.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the city, the  mayor of the suburb of Evanston  announced two investigations after federal agents were filmed striking a person during an arrest. DHS said the agents were conducting an immigration enforcement operation when another vehicle struck theirs, and that a “hostile crowd” gathered around the agents.\n \n\n   \n  City officials were “thinking through options, including going to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, or potentially communicating with our state’s attorney to figure out the right way to demand justice for our residents who were assaulted,” Mayor Daniel Biss, a Democrat running for Congress, said.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to federal activity in his state,  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker , a Democrat, signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to “create a detailed record” of agents’ actions. In doing so, the governor said the federal government was “pushing the boundaries of their authority.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once this all ends, I believe there will be people of good faith who will review what the Commission has recorded and will demand answers and accountability,” Pritzker said.\n \n\n   \n  The police chief of Durango, Colorado, has asked state authorities to investigate an incident last month where a federal officer was seen on video appearing to place a protester who had confronted him in a chokehold and shove her down an embankment.\n \n\n   \n  No known charges have been filed against the protester, who  told The Colorado Sun  the encounter left her with pain in her head, back and neck.\n \n\n   \n  “It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,” Chief Brice Current  told The New York Times .\n \n\n   \n  The  Colorado Bureau of Investigation  “will investigate whether there were state criminal law violations during the incident,” it said. Like other states, Colorado law requires that use of force by law enforcement officers must be reasonable and appropriate to a particular situation.\n \n\n   \n    Immunity claims dubious, experts say\n \n\n   \n  Threats of possible prosecution by state and local officials have come with the ire of Trump political appointees.\n \n\n   \n  “The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,” Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche  wrote on X .  \n \n\n   \n  White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller echoed that, directly addressing federal agents on Fox News, saying, “You have federal immunity in he conduct of your duties. And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony.”\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say Miller’s claim of absolutely immunity is dubious.  US criminal law  allows for the prosecution of federal and local officers who violate someone’s civil rights, including by using excessive force.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s true that federal officers have overwhelmingly broad protection when they’re carrying out their official duties,” said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “But it’s ludicrous to suggest that a federal officer who breaks state or federal law can’t ever be held accountable for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts also note the Justice Department isn’t handcuffed in policing federal agents – just that it now lacks the will to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “It is, to be clear, wrong on its face,” CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center,  wrote in his newsletter, “One First,”  of Miller’s comments. The federal government retains the power to prosecute federal officers, Vladeck wrote, even if the Trump administration “is wholly uninterested” in doing so.\n \n\n   \n  As for the states, “There may be political reasons why local or state prosecutors will be wary of bringing such cases,” Vladeck said. “But … the relevant law is far more permissive when it comes to the ability to hold federal officers accountable than Stephen Miller would have you believe.”\n \n\n   \n    Clash over body cams exacerbates the issue\n \n\n   \n  While numerous viral bystander videos have surfaced depicting heated encounters between immigration agents and members of the public, one critical tool often used to identify potential wrongdoing by police officers isn’t widely used in the immigration space: body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The topic of body cameras has at times caused friction between immigration agents and FBI agents assigned to assist with enforcement efforts, two law enforcement sources familiar with the situation previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  While FBI agents have worn body cameras during joint arrest operations per their agency’s policy, some immigration agents not wearing body cameras have expressed concern to their counterparts about having their tactics recorded, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  During one heated exchange, immigration agents who did not want to be captured on body camera footage refused to invite FBI agents along for an arrest operation, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, US District Court Judge Sara Ellis has ordered that agents to wear and use body cameras during confrontations there – a decision the Trump administration is now appealing. Ellis expressed frustration during a hearing last week, indicating that she believed administration officials were being misleading about the safety concerns surrounding protests at an ICE facility and immigration raids in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have insisted that  federal agents are facing unprecedented levels of attack . DHS says it has observed “a 1,000% increase in assaults against ICE officers.”\n \n\n   \n  While instances of violence directed at immigration officers have been documented, legal experts say there must be a distinction between actions they take in self-defense and the questionable, aggressive tactics agents have used against protesters and suspects.\n \n\n   \n  “If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped),” wrote Walter Olson, senior legal fellow at  the libertarian Cato Institute .\n \n\n   \n  At stake, he said, is a possible shift in culture among immigration officers who may now believe they can do no wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “If the agents are hearing a persistent message from their higher-ups of ‘you’re immune no matter what you do,’” Olson says, “it’s up to the rest of us to disabuse them of that error.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/middleeast/gaza-high-school-graduations-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:52:00-05:00","title":"Bittersweet moments of joy as Gaza celebrates high school graduations without schools","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, students in Gaza celebrated their high school graduation amid a backdrop of war-related destruction and loss.

Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doaa Musallem’s high school grades were so good that she got a congratulatory call from the Palestinian Minister of Education.\n \n\n   \n  But for the 18-year-old, the celebration was bittersweet.\n \n\n   \n  Like some 56,000 other students from Gaza’s class of 2025, the last two years of her education have been nearly completely disrupted by Israel’s  war in Gaza , which has killed almost 19,000 school age children, made orphans out of thousands of others, and all but decimated the enclave’s formal  education system .\n \n\n   \n  “Our happiness is incomplete because our supporter and the pillar of the house is not here,” she told CNN, speaking of her father, who was absent from the celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Doaa’s father Bassam Musallam was critically wounded by shrapnel in November 2023, when an Israeli strike hit a neighboring house and killed his friend in central Gaza, the family told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Musallam was evacuated to Egypt for medical treatment in April 2024 and has been there since, missing many milestones in his daughter’s life, including her exam results, which have gone viral.\n \n\n   \n  When she sent her father a photo of the celebrations, standing proudly next to her brother in her graduation gown and cap in front of a bright yellow balloon sign that read: “Congratulations,” she felt like the entire enclave was celebrating with her.\n \n\n   \n  “You are a hero,” Palestinian Minister of Education Amjad Barham told Doaa over the phone as he called to congratulate her on graduating high school and earning the highest grade of any student in Gaza, at 99.7%.\n \n\n   \n  Doaa’s joyful scene was emulated throughout Gaza Thursday, in bright moments that have been rare over the past two years. As the education ministry announced the grades for tens of thousands of high school students like Doaa, there was a buzz in the air as Palestinians set off fireworks and embraced in song and dance.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud Elyan, a recent graduate who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to central Gaza, stood at a crowded dessert shop in his hometown with a grin on his face.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy beyond words,” he told Palestinian state TV. “I am here to buy desserts and hand them out to people because it’s been a long time that people haven’t seen desserts after two years of war and displacement.”\n \n\n   \n  For others, graduation day is a reminder of that suffering.\n \n\n   \n  Student Doha Nazmi Abu Dalal, who had been displaced in Deir el Balah, central Gaza, achieved a near perfect GPA. But she was killed less than a month before she could see how her hard work had paid off. Abu Dalal, along with 17 members of her family, was killed in an Israeli strike on October 29, weeks after the ceasefire was implemented, according to hospital authorities.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘scholasticide’\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since October 7, 2023, has decimated the education system in Gaza, leaving it on the brink of collapse, according to UNICEF, and prompting accusations from UN experts of a  scholasticide , or the systematic destruction of a country’s education.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has repeatedly said Hamas uses schools and universities as part of its infrastructure to store weapons or as command centers. It has not addressed the scholasticide accusation directly.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously told CNN it seeks to minimize civilian harm while Hamas “cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes.”\n \n\n   \n  Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed over 97% of schools in Gaza, according to UNICEF, leaving hundreds of thousands of children with limited access to in-person learning.\n \n\n   \n  At least 18,591 school age students have been killed and 27,216 injured over the course of the war, according to the Palestinian education ministry figures. In addition, some 792 educational staff have been killed and 3,251 injured.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hassan Ali Radwan is one of the Palestinian students who experienced the loss of one of his loved ones when his cousin and study buddy was killed during the war. Like his classmates, Al-Hassan had to navigate the challenges of online education amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a hard time with internet connection, the lack of electricity and water as well as displacement and most importantly food,” Al-Hassan told WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, at a shelter for the displaced in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza on Thursday, where he and his friends had gathered to celebrate his graduation.\n \n\n   \n  In central Gaza, another graduate, Dima, who only gave her first name to state media, was celebrating with her family after overcoming trauma attached to her studies.\n \n\n   \n  She said she suffered minor injuries from an Israeli strike that happened during her first private math lesson – at a sporting club – after the war had started.\n \n\n   \n  “I stopped studying for some time because I was scared,” she said. “But I eventually had to keep going because we only get to be highschoolers once in a lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n    Going to university, without the campus\n \n\n   \n  Gaza’s 56,000 new graduates are ready for college, according to the education ministry. But there are hardly any campuses to attend.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli attacks have completely destroyed  63 university buildings  over the past two years, according to the ministry.\n \n\n   \n  And resources are scarce.  Educational supplies, like stationery, backpacks, and other resources, have been  “impossible” to bring into the enclave, despite the implementation of the October 10 ceasefire, because they are not deemed as “lifesaving humanitarian aid,” UNICEF said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some students and parents are riding the high of Thursday’s graduations, and are hopeful that Gaza’s schools and universities will soon be rebuilt.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 92% of all education facilities will require either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation to become functional again, according to a recent  UNICEF statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the pain and ache in Gaza, we want to be happy and get over our wounds,” Dima’s father said. “Students need to be back in classrooms as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, others are calling for mechanisms to help pursue college scholarships and study abroad, rather than going back online to study.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not life, they (Israel) destroyed our schools and universities,” recent graduate Mohamed Bilal Abu Faraj told Palestinian state media on Thursday after handing out desserts at a shelter.\n \n\n   \n  “Open up the border,” he added, nodding to the continued siege on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  For Doaa, her father’s injury has fueled her interest in pursuing a higher education in nursing.\n \n\n   \n  She too, hopes to continue her education abroad, where she yearns to reunite with her father once again.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Abeer Salman contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-maduro-removal-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump likely to face long military commitment and chaos if he ousts Maduro in Venezuela, experts say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article warns that if President Donald Trump orders military strikes in Venezuela to remove Nicolás Maduro, the U.S. would face significant challenges, including internal instability, military insurrection, and the rise of another authoritarian figure within Chavismo.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has said he believes Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s days are numbered, and that land strikes inside Venezuela are possible.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the US doesn’t currently have the military assets in place to launch a largescale operation to remove Maduro from power, though Trump has approved covert action within Venezuela,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n  But if Trump did order strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, he could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency, according to experts, as well as political backlash at home for a president who promised to avoid costly entanglements overseas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Trump received a briefing earlier this week to review updated options for military action inside Venezuela, a concept the White House has been  weighing . The administration had not made a decision on whether to launch strikes, CNN reported, though the US military has moved more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded Operation Southern Spear in an announcement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The concentration of military assets and threats of further attacks beyond the  ongoing drug boat campaign  have served to increase pressure on Maduro, with administration officials saying he needs to leave office while arguing that he’s closely tied to the Tren de Aragua gang and leading drug trafficking efforts.\n \n\n   \n  But if Maduro does flee Venezuela or is killed out in a targeted strike, experts worry about a military takeover of the country or the boosting of another dictator similar to Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  There are other members of the Venezuelan Chavismo, the leftist political ideology of former Cuban leader Hugo Chavez that Maduro has championed, who could take the reins and subject the country to even harsher rule, experts and former officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Maduro has said something to the effect of, ‘You want to get rid of me? You think things will get better?’ It is something to consider because Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo, and someone else could usurp power instead of the opposition with the backing of the military,” said Juan Gonzalez, a resident fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute who was a former Biden administration official focused on the region.\n \n\n   \n  Another possibility would be a military takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “If the military is still cohesive, and I don’t think we see any evidence it is not, they will not collapse because there is a challenge to or an ouster of Maduro,” said John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser in his first term. “They will follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, whose inner circle is made up of both civilians and military officers who are often in competition with each other, is known to have tight control over his administration and has helped stabilize competing factions. External forces, like Colombian insurgent groups who regularly operate from Venezuela or criminal syndicates linked to cocaine, gold and mineral trafficking further complicate the picture.\n \n\n   \n  Were Maduro to disappear, these pulls could tear the nation apart – descending into a potential civil war, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium,” said a Western diplomat who has spent years in Venezuela, asking to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss with the press. “Everyone knows he’s been politically dead since last year’s election, but if he leaves there’s nobody who can maintain the status quo … so they all close ranks around him.”\n \n\n   \n    Opposition Figures\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration may hope that Venezuelan opposition figures would be able to step into a power vacuum created by the removal of Maduro, something that the first Trump administration considered as it propped up Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. That first Trump administration officially recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela in 2019, but a failed coup attempt that year meant he never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  One current Venezuelan opposition group led by Edmundo Gonzalez, who ran for president last year in an election that  the US said Maduro lost , says it has a 100-hour plan to transition the power of Venezuela’s government from Maduro to Gonzalez. But experts say that they would be unable to succeed in the short-term or in the long-term without sustained US support – and potentially US boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible. There is no way to guarantee their safety or ability to govern without the US providing security,”  Juan Gonzalez said. “Everyone is viewing removing Maduro as the end but it’s really just the beginning of what would be a long, drawn-out process.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have also said that Edmuondo Gonzalez, who is currently residing in Spain, is the rightful leader of Venezuela, based on the results of last year’s election. The US has provided limited support to another Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who went into hiding in the country after the election. The assistance includes support, like gaining access to secure communication capabilities, former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  But in order to keep any of the potential opposition leaders in power the type of support needed from the US would go beyond providing a secure device – there would need to be assistance in reconstructing the army, unfreezing Venezuelan government funds and training their police force, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition’s enemies inside Venezuela are not limited to Maduro himself, which is why such sustained outside support is seen as a necessity, experts said. The opposition would face hostilities from the Venezuelan military; pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos; the National Liberation Army (known as the ELN), which is a Colombian guerilla group that currently has safe haven in the country; and other active criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how much support Trump would be willing to give any opposition leader who seeks to take the presidency from Maduro. But that support would need to be sustained, officials said, to fend off a failed state.\n \n\n   \n  Such an extended US military involvement runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump backs away from a potential opportunity to oust Maduro now, some believe it could be viewed as a lost opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump is calling Maduro a narcoterrorist and a drug trafficker, and has assembled a huge armada. If he backs down now and Maduro survives, there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine’ talk and the idea of being supreme in our own hemisphere.” said Elliott Abrams, a former senior State Department official in Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n    Entanglements\n \n\n   \n  Even while some say that displacing Maduro could be done without US troops on the ground for an extended period, they say that the US commitment following any kinetic strikes needs to be long-lasting or else the effort could easily fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “If the force is decisive it can disband a full army. But whatever is done cannot be done with a short-term perspective. The use of force needs to create a result and be connected to a political solution with US support, and planning for that support for 5-10 years,” said a regional diplomat.\n \n\n   \n  The Maduro regime is propped up in different ways by Russia, China and Cuba. Experts worry that if US strikes hit assets of those nations the conflict could quickly escalate. While it is unlikely that any of those nations would send their troops to the region to defend against US strikes, it is possible that the effect of US strikes inside Venezuela could be blunted by the support those countries provide to the regime.\n \n\n   \n  All three nations have invested in the Venezuelan regime and have instruments that they could bring to bear to prevent Maduro’s ouster, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  This is something that has happened in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2019, the opposition thought that the Cubans had uncovered what they were trying to do with their coup attempt and believe that they made moves to undermine their efforts,” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  Further expanding the problem could be a move by Maduro to hit US assets in the region – before the US makes any move to directly oust him.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a chance that if Maduro thinks he is going down he might make a move to hit something the US cares about, such as oil platforms in the Caribbean Sea. It could be a gamble he may be willing to take that would harm US interests in the region,” said Henry Ziemer, a regional expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Publicly the Trump administration continues to point to its buildup of military assets in Latin America as supremely focused on counter-drug operations – not an ouster of Maduro. Experts have also  previously told CNN  that the assembled hardware and troops aren’t enough for a full-scale invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Still, when asked earlier this month if the US might get into a war with Venezuela, Trump gave an ambiguous answer, saying: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/alina-habba-office-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:55:00.000-05:00","title":"Person Ransacks New Jersey Federal Prosecutor’s Office After Being Denied Meeting With US Attorney Alina Habba","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man, identified as Keith Michael Lisa, 51, ransacked the New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office building after being denied a meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba.

AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It was a late September night when muffled blasts and a stream of bubbles broke the surface of the Baltic Sea.  Explosions  had ripped through the two Nord Stream gas pipelines, Russia’s gas highway into Europe, months after Moscow’s full invasion of Ukraine. Years later, shockwaves from that night are still rippling across the continent.\n \n\n   \n  The 2022 attack on the hugely controversial pipelines triggered an international whodunnit, with suspicion falling immediately on Russia and even the US being forced to deny involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Today, intrigue continues to swirl around the blasts even as Germany readies a prosecution against the  suspected Ukrainian saboteurs . And Poland’s efforts to stymie the case – seemingly to shield its ally Ukraine - has thrown up new tensions in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Germany seems determined for Nord Stream to gets its day in court, filing arrest warrants for two Ukrainian men – Volodymyr Zhuravlov, who was detained in Poland, and Serhii Kuznietsov, who was detained in Italy - suspected of involvement in the blast.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of other nations have cast doubt on whether criminal proceedings should be brought against those allegedly responsible.\n \n\n   \n  A decision by a Polish court in mid-October to free Zhuravlov, after slow-balling the man’s extradition, has severely undercut Berlin’s hopes of a prosecution. In the eyes of the judge, if the Nord Stream blasts were a Ukrainian act of sabotage, that would be a justified response to an unprovoked invasion.\n \n\n   \n  “If Ukraine was indeed the organizer of this act of aggression, then only Ukraine can be held responsible for this event,” Judge Dariusz Lubowski said in his verdict halting Zhuravlov’s extradition to Germany, CNN affiliate TVN24  reported .\n \n\n   \n  The 49-year-old Ukrainian claims he had nothing to do with the attack and that he was in Ukraine at the time it happened, according to TVN24.\n \n\n   \n  German prosecutors allege Zhuravlov, a “trained diver,” was “part of a group of individuals who placed explosives on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines near the island of Bornholm in September 2022.” The team allegedly used fake identities to rent a yacht to ferry them and their equipment to the blast site.\n \n\n   \n  Serhii Kuznietsov, a 49-year-old former Ukrainian soldier and an alleged coordinator of the operation, was detained on a German warrant in Italy in late August.\n \n\n   \n  Kuznietsov’s defense lawyer Nicola Canestrini told CNN that the Ukrainian denies any wrongdoing and he is currently appealing Italy’s Supreme Court’s decision to extradite him to Germany.\n \n\n   \n  “Europe’s problem, Ukraine’s problem, the problem of Lithuania and Poland, is not that Nord Stream 2 was blown up, but that it was built,”   Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told journalists in early October.\n \n\n   \n  “It is certainly not in the interest of Poland, nor in the interest of decency and justice, to prosecute or extradite this citizen to another state,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Tusk’s stance reflects long-standing concerns over the pipelines within Europe and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  As far back as 2007, Poland’s then-defense minister Radek Sikorski  railed  against the proposed Nord Stream 1 pipeline as, “the most outrageous attempt by Mr Putin to divide and damage the EU.”\n \n\n   \n  Europe’s dependency on Russian hydrocarbons has faced opposition from US administrations going back to the White House of George W. Bush. That feeling has long been bipartisan: as Republican Senator Ted Cruz told senators in 2019: the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, “if completed, would make Europe even more dependent on Russian energy, even more vulnerable to Russian blackmail.”\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, the Polish stance exposed divisions in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  “Shocking” was how Peter Szijjarto, foreign minister of Hungary – one of Russia’s few allies on the continent and the recent recipient of a  US exemption  allowing them to continue buying Russian oil and gas - described Tusk’s stance.\n \n\n   \n  “One thing is clear: we don’t want a Europe where prime ministers defend terrorists,” he  wrote on X. \n \n\n   \n  For many in Europe’s north, the attention on who blew up Nord Stream is a distraction from remembering how it was built in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Lithuania’s former foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told CNN that, if you take the legal case in isolation, “it might force us to forget how we got there.” The Polish government’s position “has quite a lot to do with their internal politics, their president being from a very nationalist party,”\n \n\n   \n  Helga Kalm, deputy director of Estonia’s International Center for Defence and Security, told CNN. “It’s their sign of showing Germany that they’re doing the wrong thing” in pursuing a prosecution that could harm Ukrainian interests.\n \n\n   \n  Many in Europe’s post-Soviet countries, Poland chief among them, finally feel vindicated after decades of warning against the push from European powers like Germany to warm ties with Russia.\n \n\n   \n    Hunt for ‘justice’\n \n\n   \n  Both  Denmark  and Sweden – whose waters sit astride the Nord Stream pipeline – declined to pursue cases into the blasts, with Sweden citing a lack of jurisdiction.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Germany has forged ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a rule of law state,” Stefan Meister, an expert on Eastern Europe from the German Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is particularly for domestic purposes,” he added. With right-wing populists the AfD challenging the credibility of state institutions, allowing German justice to follow its course is about, “the credibility of the system and the institution and the ruling political elites,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Germany was the driving force in Europe behind the Nord Stream pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  And it reaped the benefits. In 2016, nearly 30% of German gas needs were met by Russian suppliers, funnelling gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, according to  German government figures .\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s chancellor between 1998 and 2005, Gerhard Schroeder, went on to try to join the board of Russian energy giant Gazprom and became chairman of Russia’s oil giant Rosneft after leaving office.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, the pipelines became totemic of the dependence on cheap Russian hydrocarbons that critics felt Europe traded for a principled stance on Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  Former Chancellor Angela Merkel attracted special criticism for her conciliatory approach to Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  In Merkel’s recently released memoir, she rebutted accusations that Germany had been dependent on Russian gas, writing, “particularly in the case of Nord Stream 2, even though no gas had ever been transported through this pipeline… It was a relic of a failed investment.”\n \n\n   \n  Given how interwoven many in German politics were with the push to construct the Nord Stream pipelines, today many politicians would welcome distancing themselves from the case, Meister said.\n \n\n   \n  “My impression is they want to wash themselves clean,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Need for clarity\n \n\n   \n  The fog around the case only serves to feed tensions in Europe at a time when unity against Russia, and an unpredictable ally in the US, is all-important. Russia’s efforts to sow divisions abroad are well documented but here the Kremlin may have achieved one of its goals without lifting a finger.\n \n\n   \n  Nord Stream risks “further questions and maybe fractures within the alliance,” Landsbergis said. “Especially at a time where we’re no longer at peace, that should be remembered.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the result of Germany’s quest for judicial satisfaction over Nord Stream, Russian gas won’t be flowing south like it did before 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe has battled to wean itself off a decades-long dependence on Russia gas. The loss of Nord Stream only hastened that.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s share of EU imports of pipeline gas dropped from more than 40% in 2021 to about 11% in 2024, according to  EU figures .\n \n\n   \n  “The right place for Nord Stream 2 is at the bottom of the sea, in pieces,” Estonia’s Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in March.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/style/dave-celebrity-restaurant-polaroid-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:50:00-05:00","title":"How Davé Became the Ultimate Celebrity Hotspot","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For over 36 years, the Chinese restaurant Davé on Rue Saint-Roch in Paris’s 1st Arrondissement became a celebrated celebrity hotspot, attracting figures such as Serge Gainsbourg, David Lynch, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Moss, and Kim Kardashian.

hotspot \n       \n  By Zoe Whitfield, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:50 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s not uncommon for a bar or café to remind patrons that someone famous once ate there by having a physical photograph of said VIP on display. For 36 years however, at Davé, a Chinese restaurant on Rue Saint-Roch in Paris’s 1st Arrondissement, Polaroids of beloved guests were less a marketing tactic than a key feature of the building’s interior, framed and affixed to any available wall space.\n \n\n   \n  The various portraits, which included those of the singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, filmmaker David Lynch, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, model Kate Moss, and entrepreneur and socialite Kim Kardashian, made up something akin to a personal album for owner Tai “Davé” Cheung.\n \n\n   \n  “The immediacy fascinated me,” the restauranteur told CNN, recalling his initial interest in the Polaroid. He purchased the camera, at least partly inspired by Andy Warhol, the same year he opened Davé, in 1982, a year and half after his father’s restaurant shuttered. The photographer Helmut Newton and his wife June were early fans (so much so they spent a Christmas on the premises), quickly followed by Vogue’s Grace Coddington, until eventually Davé’s clientele was near-exclusively comprised of significant figures from the arenas of fashion, film, art, literature and music, as a new book, “ A Night at Davé ,” celebrates.\n \n\n   \n  Conceived with writers Charles Morin and Boris Bergmann and released by the London publisher IDEA, the book boasts 115 pages of photographs and selfies, as well as doodles and postcards from several guests. Sofia Coppola, whose father Francis Ford Coppola once booked the entire restaurant for New Year’s Eve, wrote the foreword. “I was fourteen and the place was filled with the fashion and show business of that era, people table-hopping and hanging out, platters of Davé’s mom’s Chinese food and Davé taking Polaroids,” she recalled, characterizing the mood that night. “Somehow I ended up cozied up with Yves Saint Laurent” — one of the 20th century’s foremost designers.\n \n\n   \n  “A party always felt like a kind of family gathering, something intimate,” Davé, as he is habitually referred, said over email. “Everything was closed, it created a very private, familial atmosphere.” Even outside the parameters of a private party, the discreet milieu of the restaurant — largely down to Davé’s considered seating arrangements and further encouraged by the scarce lighting (the glow of a tropical fish tank in the center of the space helped somewhat) — meant famous people, who would otherwise typically be bothered by strangers, felt comfortable and relaxed enough that most would return multiple times, making Davé the place to be.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in The New York Times in August 1998, Dana Thomas observed, “You can gauge who’s in and who’s out simply by what happens when he or she walks into Davé,” alluding to the owner’s guarded system. That it was close to Jardin des Tuileries, where much of Paris Fashion Week played out, further enamored it to editors, stylists, and models. Indeed, in January 2005, The Guardian ran a profile of the restaurant with the headline, “Welcome to the fashion canteen” (by this point Davé had moved to new premises, about ten minutes away on Rue de Richelieu, but still within the vicinity of fashion week footfall).\n \n\n   \n  With its distinctive swirling logo above the front door and, famously, always with a “complet” (meaning “full”) sign in the window, a practice that meant Davé was able to ensure space was kept available for his celebrity regulars, the Polaroid was a frequent feature of any night at the restaurant. “It was very instinctive (taking photographs). I wanted to preserve the beauty and joy of those moments, I didn’t know it would become a thing,” said Davé, who was taught how to focus the camera by the photographer and director, Jean-Baptiste Mondino. “At the beginning, the Polaroids just piled up. One day someone stole one — that’s when I understood they had value, that they were objects of desire.”\n \n\n   \n  The images that appear in the new book were safely stored away for years (most of those on the walls of the restaurant were copies, a preemptive measure to secure the memories had a future), but Davé estimates he produced a few thousand over the years. “I’ve lost some, given some away, but most are still with me. I particularly love the photos I took of people on the phone, like Aurore Clément, Keith Haring, and Mick Jagger. It’s rare to see them photographed like that,” he noted, recalling pictures of people using the landline. “They (the wider clientele) were very happy because they could see the result immediately. There’s no surprise with the Polaroid — you can’t take bad pictures of people without them knowing.”\n \n\n   \n  More than four decades after the restaurant opened, and seven years since it closed its doors for the last time, working on “A Night at Davé” has been a thoroughly positive experience for Davé. “I thought that Polaroids no longer had a place — that the phone has replaced them — but I loved diving back into my archives,” he said. “I didn’t feel sadness, nostalgia, or regret (putting the book together). I loved learning from people, diving into their worlds, their universes, so I was happy to see all the good moments I’d lived.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/asia/denis-obrezko-russia-hacker-thailand-void-blizzard","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:49:00-05:00","title":"Russian Altered Cyber-Hacker Faces Extradition to US After Arrest in Thailand","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 35-year-old Russian man, Denis Obrezko, was arrested in Phuket, Thailand on November 6, 2025, in a joint operation between Thai authorities and the FBI, after being suspected of cyber-crimes linked to the notorious Void Blizzard cyber-espionage group.

 President Donald Trump’s administration said on Friday it was formally withdrawing a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when US flight disruptions are caused by carriers.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, the US Transportation Department under then-President Joe Biden sought public comment on writing rules  to require airlines to pay  $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays.\n \n\n   \n  In September, USDOT first disclosed  it planned to withdraw the proposal . On Friday, USDOT said the rules would result in “unnecessary regulatory burdens” in explaining why it would not go forward.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, a group of 18 Democratic senators urged the Trump administration not to drop the compensation plan.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a common-sense proposal: when an airline’s mistake imposes unanticipated costs on families, the airline should try to remedy the situation by providing accommodations to consumers and helping cover their costs,” said the letter signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey and others.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines in the US must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules. No large US airline currently guarantees cash compensation for significant flight disruption.\n \n\n   \n  USDOT said Friday in abandoning the compensation plan that it would “allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.”\n \n\n   \n  USDOT also announced in September it was considering rescinding Biden regulations requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose service fees alongside airfares.\n \n\n   \n  It also plans to reduce regulatory burdens on airlines and ticket agents by writing new rules detailing the definition of a flight cancellation that entitles consumers to ticket refunds, as well as revisiting rules on ticket pricing and advertising.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines have pushed the Trump administration to go further and praised the action to rescind the Biden plan.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-colleges-california-funding-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-05:00","title":"Judge Bars Trump from Immediately Cutting Funding to the University of California","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Rita Lin, blocked the Trump administration from immediately cutting federal funding to the University of California or imposing fines over claims of antisemitism and discrimination, ruling that such actions constitute a concerted campaign to suppress 'woke' ideologies.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) posted on X Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a drug caliphate in our backyard that includes Venezuela, Colombia and Cuba. I am very glad President Trump is dedicated to ending this reign of terror,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Officials from all three countries have denied any ties to trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Maduro, a committed socialist and longtime thorn in the side of US foreign policy aims in the region, Noriega, at least initially, presented himself as a US ally.\n \n\n   \n  Through much of his bloody rise to power in Panama – the small but geopolitically key country with its canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans – Noriega was a CIA asset, assisting to stamp out the spread of leftist governments in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  But as CIA arms flowed through Panama to support anti-communist rebels in Central America, Noriega had a secret: He was also allowing tons of cocaine to pass north to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega’s fungible loyalties led former US Ambassador to Panama Ambler Moss to declare of the Panamanian dictator, “You can’t buy him, but you can sure as hell rent him.”\n \n\n   \n  By 1989 Noriega’s double dealing and brutal crackdown on civil society led to Washington issuing an ultimatum: Go into exile or else.\n \n\n   \n  Like Maduro today – who vehemently denies US allegations of drug trafficking – Noriega had to choose whether to flee or face off with a military far superior to his own.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, retired Panamanian General Rubén Darío Paredes told CNN, Noriega opted for exile.\n \n\n   \n  “He began making arrangements for the succession of command according to the hierarchy, but he had a moment of weakness,” Paredes said. “When many of that group who had been exposed began to think about their fate, right? They were exposed, and they made common cause and convinced Noriega that he was the ultimate authority, that there was no turning back. Then Noriega backed down and that’s when the invasion happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing Noriega’s defiance and worsening repression, US President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama – codenamed “Operation Just Cause” – in December 1989, arguing Noriega’s rule posed a threat to US lives and security.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 20,000 US troops on Panamanian soil, Noriega took refuge in the Vatican’s embassy in Panama City for 10 days. US troops surrounded the compound with loudspeakers blasting his hideout with deafening heavy metal music through the night.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega eventually surrendered to US Drug Enforcement Administration officials on January 3, 1990.\n \n\n   \n  His trial in 1991 was called the “trial of the century” by the DEA and eventually saw him found guilty on eight counts and sentenced to 40 years in jail.\n \n\n   \n  While taking down a repressive leader with ties to drug cartels – Maduro also faces a US indictment for trafficking – seems identical to US’ goals in Venezuela, there are important differences.\n \n\n   \n  Panama in 1989, when the US invasion took place, only had a population of 2.5 million, Venezuela’s population today is over 28 million.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s land mass is more than ten times the size of Panama – which, at the time of the invasion, hosted US military bases.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, as with Noriega when he considered exile, many in Maduro’s inner circle face US trafficking allegations or million-dollar rewards for their capture, making them unlikely to see him leave power without a fight.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, any US military action in Venezuela would likely have to contend with the country’s impenetrable jungles and dense slums, where gang members are so heavily armed that even the Venezuelan military rarely enters.\n \n\n   \n  Frank Mora, former US Ambassador at the organization of American states OAS who has studied how a possible US invasion could unfold and the hurdles the US military faces in deposing Maduro, said the US could topple the Venezuelan leader easily but keeping the peace is another matter.\n \n\n   \n  “The question of Venezuelan military capability is not a serious one,” Mora said. “It’s not one that could sustain a US invasion, but my concern has always been, it’s not just the time that it requires to bring down the regime, it’s the day after, and how do you maintain order in a country that has essentially collapsed?”\n \n\n   \n  While it remains unclear if the US will put any boots on the ground or even carry out strikes in Venezuela, increasingly it appears the US will not count on the support of many regional allies.\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference on Thursday, Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, who publicly opposed the Noriega dictatorship before the US invasion, said his country would not host any US forces that might take part in a military action against Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “In relation to Venezuela we don’t have anything to do with that,” Mulino said. “Panama is not lending its territory for any hostile act against Venezuela or another country in the world.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-epstein-doj-investigate-enemies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he’s asking Justice Department to investigate Epstein’s ties to slew of high-profile figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a federal criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s relationships with numerous high-profile individuals, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and JPMorgan Chase.

Donald Judd, Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:17 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  said Friday he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s ties to many other high-profile figures, in an extraordinary step that comes just days after Democrats released  emails  from the late Epstein that mention him.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the directive in a Truth Social post that accused Democrats of trying to revive attention to his past ties with Epstein, contending they are “using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.”\n \n\n   \n  “I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later on Friday confirmed she would launch the investigation on Trump’s orders, assigning Jay Clayton, the top prosecutor in New York’s southern district, to lead the federal probe.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you, Mr. President,” she wrote in a  post on X  that included a screenshot of Trump’s request.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, after Bondi ordered the FBI to review Epstein files for release, Justice and FBI officials conducted another assessment and determined there were no additional prosecutions that could be brought based on the evidence at hand, according to law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s move on Friday   represents the president’s most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of the president’s belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Why doesn’t he just release these? Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. “Now he’s in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  lengthy thread on X , Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, blasted Trump’s directive and called on the administration to release all the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein,” he wrote, adding later, “I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Clinton  said on X : “These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Summers for comment about Trump’s demands for an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank “ended our relationship with (Epstein) years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump earlier this week  tried and failed  to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department’s Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.\n \n\n   \n  Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert some documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee that had not yet been released. Trump appeared to acknowledge Friday that was part of a bid by his administration to dissuade her from driving more conversation on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “When you talk about the Epstein hoax, what happens is, you’re not talking about how well we’ve done,” Trump added while speaking aboard Air Force One. “That’s the whole purpose behind them. They want to waste people’s time and some of the dumber Republicans like that, but it’s mostly Democrats, by the way.”\n \n\n   \n  But they could not change her mind.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realization that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  But the newly announced criminal investigation could give the Justice Department a new justification to resist turning over files — or convince some lawmakers to back off. Generally, the department resists giving Congress files during an ongoing criminal investigation because any public release could jeopardize the integrity of the probe or any resulting criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “This will certainly give members of Congress a basis on which to vote against disclosing the Epstein files,” CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. “If there’s an ongoing criminal investigation, that’s a perfectly good reason for Congress to back off or to vote no.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the controversy Friday night, Trump told reporters he and Epstein had “a very bad relationship for years,” and sought to turn the focus to those he had demanded face investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Summers, whatever his name is, and all of the other people that he spent time with, Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years. But he also saw strength, because I was president, so he dictated a couple of memos to himself. Give me a break. You’re gonna find out what did he know, with respect to Bill Clinton, with respect to the head of Harvard, with respect to all of those people that he knew, including JP Morgan Chase,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails released earlier this week, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails “prove literally nothing” and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein “hoax” to distract from the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration’s response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump doesn’t want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn’t prove anything,” one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In the 24 hours after the House Oversight Committee’s Wednesday release of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name, Trump had declined to take questions from the press. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.” He then took questions from reporters while flying to Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote in one post.\n \n\n   \n  He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into “many other people and institutions” in a subsequent Truth Social post.\n \n\n   \n  In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  Clinton and Epstein had been friendly in the early 2000s, with the former president appearing on Epstein’s private jet logs at least 16 times between 2002 and 2003 for trips he said were related to Clinton Foundation work. Clinton would  later write  that his relationship with Epstein had ended by 2003 before he was aware of the financier’s crimes. Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein’s survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell, Kit Maher, Evan Perez and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/john-beam-laney-college-shooting-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"John Beam, Beloved Football Coach Featured in ‘Last Chance U’, Dies After Shooting on California Campus","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Beam, the beloved former football coach and mentor at Laney College in Oakland, died from gunshot wounds sustained during a targeted incident on campus on November 14, 2025.

former football coach featured in Netflix’s ‘Last Chance U’, dies after shooting on California campus \n       \n  By Laura Sharman, Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  John Beam, a cherished football coach whose mentorship and care touched the lives of thousands of people, has died after being shot Thursday on an Oakland college campus — a devastating loss for a California community still reeling from another act of school gun violence just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  The revered Bay Area football figure featured in Netflix documentary series “Last Chance U” was rushed to Highland Hospital in critical condition Thursday but died Friday morning, Oakland police homicide commander Lt. Gloria Beltran announced at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Police identified the suspect as 27-year-old Cedric Irving, Beltran said. The suspect was acquainted with Beam but did not have a close relationship with him, according to Oakland Assistant Chief of Police James Beere.\n \n\n   \n  For many, the news felt unthinkable.\n \n\n   \n  Piedmont Police Chief Frederick Shavies described Beam as a “father figure to thousands of not only men but young women,” someone who left an “indelible” imprint on Oakland and far beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds gathered for a vigil Thursday night, holding candles and hope as Beam fought for his life — the same way he had spent decades teaching young people to fight for their own, Shavies said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hearts are aching,” Shavies said, reflecting on the man he had known since eighth grade — the man who stepped in with support after Shavies’ father died.\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s family said in a statement read by police: “We are devastated that John — our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, coach, mentor and friend — has passed. Our hearts are full from the outpouring of love and support from all who cared about him. We are deeply grateful for your continued prayers and ask for privacy during this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, questions remain about what authorities described as a “very targeted incident,” as the suspect awaits formal charges. The case will be referred to the district attorney’s office for review.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about the suspect\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday at 11:53 a.m., Oakland Police officers responded to Laney College and found Beam suffering from gunshot wounds, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  Beam had been at the college’s fieldhouse, which houses the athletic training facilities, where he continued serving as athletic director after retiring as head football coach last year. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and listed in critical condition.\n \n\n   \n  Officials obtained photos of the suspect, who was later spotted at the San Leandro Bay Area Rapid Transit station. He was taken into custody and gave a statement to police regarding the shooting, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  “The ability to actually track the suspect after he left Laney College was a diligent effort and an amazing, heavy lift to go through hundreds of hours of surveillance footage so we could track that individual,” Beere, Oakland’s assistant chief of police, said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect played football at Skyline High School in Oakland, but not while Beam was employed there, authorities said. Although Irving was not a student at Laney College, he was often seen loitering on campus, Beere added.\n \n\n   \n  “Coach Beam, although (he and the suspect) did not have a close relationship, was open to helping everybody in our community, and this is not uncommon for him to have a relationship with someone that he would think needs help,” Beere said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said Irving was on campus for a specific purpose, though they did not specify what that was. While authorities described the encounter as targeted, Beere confirmed it was not connected to a robbery.\n \n\n   \n    A champion for second chances\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s impact on the game stretched across more than four decades. He began coaching in Oakland in 1982 as Skyline High School’s defensive coordinator before joining Laney College in 2004 as the running backs coach, later becoming offensive coordinator and eventually head coach in 2012. Under his leadership, Laney won two league titles.\n \n\n   \n  His influence reached far beyond the sidelines. More than 20 of Beam’s former players went on to the NFL, including seven who played in the Super Bowl, according to his  biography on the college’s website. \n \n\n   \n  His appearance in the 2020 season of “Last Chance U” introduced his tough-love mentorship style to a national audience and cemented his status as a champion for young athletes seeking a second chance.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Netflix for comment.\n \n\n   \n  To the Bay Area, Beam was more than a coach. He was a builder of people, a steady presence, a believer in potential.\n \n\n   \n  Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee reflected on the profound impact Beam had on the community, calling his legacy one “we all have to lift up, given the way he mentored young people, people who never would have had a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Beam coached the mayor’s nephew when he attended Skyline High School, she said, calling Beam “a phenomenal human being.” His influence transcended the football field, she added; he was a mentor, a friend, and a source of guidance for students, athletes and community members from all walks of life.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor described the city’s grief, noting the outpouring of support from people across Oakland as the community struggles with the loss.\n \n\n   \n  “He was friends with everyone and encouraged everyone. He never thought anyone was a lost cause,” Lee told CNN on Friday. “People feel the void already and are grieving this loss like you would not believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Athletes across the country took to social media to mourn Beam, sharing photos and memories that capture the stunning impact he had on their lives. Chicago Bears cornerback Nahshon Wright  posted a group photo with Beam , writing simply, “Will forever miss you dawg.” New Orleans Saints cornerback Rejzohn Wright shared a  heartfelt homage,  captioning a cheerful photo of a trio posing with Beam, “Crushed.”\n \n\n   \n  “I pray my prayers strong enough,” Wright wrote over a memorial video montage of Beam guiding and inspiring his athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Both athletes shared a video from April 2023, taken days before the NFL draft, showing Beam at football practice. Wearing his signature sunglasses and mustache, he jokes with the players while offering guidance — a fleeting, tender glimpse of the warmth, humor, and care that made him much more than a coach.\n \n\n   \n  Closing his remarks during the news conference, Shavies said, “I know that if Coach were here, he’d finish by saying, ‘Two claps — ready, ready.’”\n \n\n   \n    Another life ‘stolen’ by gun violence\n \n\n   \n  Laney College was  placed on lockdown  Thursday after reports of a shooting, as police secured the area and launched an investigation. The campus reopened Friday with mental health and counseling services available, the college said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Peralta community is devastated by his shooting,” Chancellor Tammeil Gilkerson said in a message to employees. “We are stunned and heartbroken that such violence has touched our campus and one of the most respected and beloved members of our Laney, Peralta, and Oakland community.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilkerson described Beam as “a renowned coach, teacher, mentor, and leader whose impact extends far beyond athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Lee condemned the killing, saying gun violence has “stolen” another life and warning that the city cannot allow firearms to continue flooding its streets and destroying the very people “who are trying to save our community.”\n \n\n   \n  “Coach’s Beam’s legacy isn’t measured in championships or statistics,” Lee said in the statement Friday. “It’s measured in the thousands of young people he believed in, mentored, and refused to abandon … He gave Oakland’s youth their best chance, and he never stopped fighting for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident is Oakland’s second school shooting in two days.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, one juvenile was shot and two were arrested at Skyline High School,  police said . The juvenile who was shot was taken to the hospital and was in stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “It is devastating,” Lee added. “Schools should be the safest spaces in our city. We need guns off our streets now.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/welsh-police-arrest-man-impersonating-navy-officer-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00-05:00","title":"Man Charged Over Allegedly Impersonating High-Ranking Navy Officer at Remembrance Sunday Parade","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Carley, a 64-year-old man from Harlech, northern Wales, has been charged with unlawful use of military uniforms after wearing a navy officer’s uniform with 12 colored medals at a Remembrance Sunday wreath-laying service in Llandudno on November 9, 2025.

What happens next? \n       \n  By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:32 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the latest judicial blow to President Donald Trump’s push to detain and  deport undocumented immigrants  en masse, a judge ruled Wednesday hundreds of people arrested in an Illinois immigration operation must be released.\n \n\n   \n  The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know – and what we don’t know – about what happens next.\n \n\n   \n    What did the judge decide?\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was  nominated by  former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022 settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Cummings ruled  agents violated the  previously agreed upon consent decree .\n \n\n   \n  Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026,  and says  if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”\n \n\n   \n    Who will be released and when?\n \n\n   \n  Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Out of a list of the more than 600 detainees the Justice Department shared with the court, only 16 had explanations for why they were given an “ICE Further Designation of High Public Safety Risk.” The document indicates they were arrested for a range of charges, including for aggravated assault, DUI, domestic battery, and criminal conspiracy to traffic narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  The document also lists around 40 people as having a “high” risk to public safety designation – though officials do not provide the reasons why. CNN has reached out to Department of Homeland Security and DOJ attorneys for clarity.\n \n\n   \n  Two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”\n \n\n   \n  The list of detainees CNN reviewed showed that 75 people have already been “removed” and multiple others are listed as having been “paroled” or “bonded out.”\n \n\n   \n    What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.\n \n\n   \n  But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.\n \n\n   \n  “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n   “We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his CBP agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including  from a federal judge , for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin  previously told CNN , while  other immigration legal challenges  move through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago  amid protests against  the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Zoe Sottile, Dianne Gallagher and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/appeals-court-declines-probable-cause-order-trump-officials-contempt","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:19:00-05:00","title":"Appeals court declines to reinstate order finding ‘probable cause exists’ to hold Trump officials in criminal contempt","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A divided federal appeals court declined to reinstate a lower court's finding that probable cause exists for criminal contempt, stemming from the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants despite a prior court order to halt the action.

\nUpdated: \n        7:19 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A divided federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration on Friday in a case over the president’s use of the  Alien Enemies Act  in deportation matters — but it did not fully snuff out a lower court judge’s efforts to punish those who ignored previous orders halting the president’s use of the law.\n \n\n   \n  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday declined to reinstate an order from US District Judge James Boasberg that found “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for violating his prior orders to temporarily stop using the law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n \n\n   \n  The Friday appeals court ruling is the latest blow to Boasberg’s efforts to hold accountable the administration officials who didn’t follow his orders earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three months ago, a three-judge panel of the appeals court wiped away Boasberg’s contempt ruling from April. Now, the entire appeals court has decided to keep that ruling intact.\n \n\n   \n  But the court’s decision does not fully tie Boasberg’s hands. Because of the way the appeals court ruled this summer – and the court’s decision on Friday to not disturb that ruling – Boasberg is able to move forward with his fact-finding inquiry around the officials involved in the matter, and several members of the court went out of their way to make that point clear Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court remains free to require the government to identify the decision makers who directed the potentially contemptuous actions and to carefully consider next steps,” three appeals court judges wrote in a statement respecting the court’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the migrants at the center of the case, said the court’s latest ruling “allows us to go back before Judge Boasberg and present all of the new evidence from the whistleblower that the government deliberately violated the court’s order not to hand over the Venezuelan men to El Salvador.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, an ex-Justice Department lawyer alleged in a whistleblower complaint that a then-top DOJ official told his colleagues in March that the administration intended to ignore court orders as part of the government’s aggressive deportation effort.\n \n\n   \n  In court proceedings this summer, Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, raised the whistleblower’s claims, saying he would be interested in scrutinizing them should any contempt proceedings before him start back up.\n \n\n   \n  Three judges at the DC Circuit – all of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents – dissented from the court’s decision on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In a stinging dissent penned by appeals court Judge Florence Pan, the appointee of former President Joe Biden skewered the Trump administration’s “meritless appeal” of Boasberg’s ruling from April and her colleagues’ earlier decision to scramble the judge’s plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Our constitutional system was functioning as designed until a panel of this court improvidently intervened,” Pan wrote. “The district court was called upon to check an allegedly unlawful policy implemented by the Executive Branch. When the government apparently defied a court order, the district court properly investigated. In merely seeking information about the government’s apparent contempt of court, the district court did not violate any nondiscretionary duty nor clearly abuse its discretion.”\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg, she said, “did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Pan also pointed to comments from President Donald Trump earlier this year that were critical of Boasberg as the case was unfolding. Trump called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “We should not leave in place a ruling that says that the district court erred when it did not,” she wrote. “We live in a world in which judges face threats and harassment because of their rulings and have been called ‘rogue’ by government officials who disagree with them. And we cannot overlook that, in response to this very case, the President of the United States called for the district judge’s impeachment.”\n \n\n   \n  She continued: “The district court performed its constitutional duty with unwavering integrity and courage, in the face of undue public criticism from the most powerful official in our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  In the case before Boasberg, the judge had ordered the administration in mid-March to turn around planes carrying migrants being deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.\n \n\n   \n  The flights continued, and the migrants were held at the prison for several months before being released this summer as part of a prisoner swap with Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court ultimately determines that the Government’s actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt,”  Boasberg wrote in a 46-page ruling detailing his decision  in April.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/travel/thanksgiving-travel-government-shutdown-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:13:00-05:00","title":"The government shutdown is over.

The staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports, frozen at 6% since Wednesday night when the shutdown ended, will drop to 3% starting on Saturday, the Department of Transportation said.\n \n\n   \n  “The 3 percent reduction will remain in place while the FAA monitors system performance throughout the weekend and evaluates whether normal operations can resume,” the DOT said in a news release on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would “allow U.S. airlines to restore their operations ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday.”\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian feels optimistic about a swift recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings” on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Andy Rose, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/health/bird-flu-washington-case","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"18:17:00Z","title":"Strain of bird flu virus never before reported in people is behind first human case in US in nine months","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Washington resident has been hospitalized with a previously unreported strain of H5N5 avian influenza, marking the first human case in the U.S. in nine months.

6:17 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Washington resident has been hospitalized with bird flu, according to the Washington State Health Department, and they’re infected with a strain of the virus that hasn’t been seen in humans before.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months, but the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  says that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.\n \n\n   \n  The patient, who has been hospitalized with H5N5 avian influenza since early this month, is described as an older resident of Grays Harbor County who has underlying health issues. It isn’t clear exactly how they caught the virus; state and local public health and agriculture officials are investigating, but they suspect that the person may have been exposed through backyard poultry.\n \n\n   \n  The virus spreads through an animal’s saliva, mucus and feces, or through milk from dairy cattle. The general risk of bird flu goes up in the late fall and winter as birds migrate and come into contact with other animals like backyard flocks.\n \n\n   \n  Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.\n \n\n   \n  There has been no known human-to-human transmission of the virus in the US, but public health leaders in Washington are contacting people who may have been in close contact with the Grays Harbor patient to check for symptoms and offer testing and treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the overall risk to the public is low, Dr. Richard Webby says, the virus still has “pandemic potential.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s clear it’s not an easy leap for this virus to make, to switch from being a duck virus to being a human virus. I think that’s pretty clear, but I certainly wouldn’t put money on the fact that it can’t make that leap,” said Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. “It’s going to take a little bit of the biologic stars aligning for that to happen. We could argue exactly how likely that is, but no one actually knows. Only time will tell us, unfortunately.”\n \n\n   \n  Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the ongoing outbreak, according to the CDC. One person died in January who was also elderly and had underlying conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.\n \n\n   \n  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington State Department of Health urges people cleaning up around bird feeders and other areas exposed to bird feces to wear gloves and disinfect the area with a mixture of one part bleach to 10 parts water or a commercial disinfectant like Lysol spray.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife. If disposing of a dead bird, wear a well-fitting face mask and disposable gloves, and use an inside-out plastic bag to pick up the carcass. The health department suggests double-bagging the bird and disposing of it in a sealed trash can so other animals don’t try to eat it. Wash hand thoroughly afterwards.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid consuming uncooked, undercooked or unpasteurized food like raw cheese or raw milk.\n \n\n   \n  The health department also recommends getting a flu shot. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/halligan-james-comey-grand-jury-transcript","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:06:00-05:00","title":"Lindsey Halligan says ‘there are no missing minutes’ in grand jury transcripts in James Comey case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, raised concerns that a transcript from the grand jury proceedings in the case against former FBI Director James Comey was incomplete, suggesting the absence of court reporting during a key period.

with  Black Health Matters , Pickens, 71, said he’s always prioritized his yearly physical and noted that prostate cancer runs in his family.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, he said, his primary physician recommended that he see a urologist after a blood test came back with elevated numbers that caused concern.\n \n\n   \n  A biopsy later revealed a tumor, but a PET scan showed the cancer had not spread. He went on to have a robotic procedure to remove part of his prostate.\n \n\n   \n  “It was rare enough that they wanted to make sure that they were crossing all the T’s and dotting all their I’s.

Can it keep its edge? \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, Joyce Jiang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:37 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As US duties on Chinese imports spun higher and higher earlier this year, Derek Wang braced for major disruption.\n \n\n   \n  With US orders ground to a halt, Wang, 36, who sells intelligent cookware out of southern China’s Guangdong province, looked elsewhere to fill the gap. After finding new buyers in Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and Cambodia, he learned what he describes as a key lesson: “Nothing is more important than the markets close to us.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories like Wang’s have played out across China’s vast economy where businesses, large and small, scrambled to fill the void after temporary triple-digit duties – and the threat of their return – upended Chinese exports to the world’s wealthiest market.\n \n\n   \n  The result has been a coup for China’s trade juggernaut.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of seeing exports falter on lost US business, the world’s largest manufacturer has driven them deeper into other markets around the world – building on the country’s global economic footprint and hedges companies made during Trump’s first trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The resilience gave Beijing confidence in its months-long negotiations with the US, which came to a head in October when leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met and agreed to a truce that whittles new tariffs on Chinese goods down to 20%.\n \n\n   \n  But the push also puts China on track to eclipse last year’s gaping nearly $1 trillion global trade surplus – a balance that’s irritated governments around the world and sparked Trump’s trade war in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  There were already questions about the sustainability of China’s export blitz before data released last week showed exports unexpectedly contracted by just over 1% year on year in October – the first downturn since February.\n \n\n   \n  Whether China can maintain its level of exports to the rest of the world – and expand back into the US market after the recent truce, is a consequential question for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues to struggle with lackluster demand from its own consumers, but doubles down on manufacturing as its economic cornerstone.\n \n\n   \n    China’s trade resilience\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, the shift in China’s export flows has been stark – and sent a clear message that, for China, the US is not irreplaceable.\n \n\n   \n  While exports to the US dropped nearly 18% in the first 10 months of this year versus that period in 2024, they were up more than 7% to the European Union, 14% to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and 26% to Africa, according to Chinese customs data released last week. Overall, exports rose 5.3%.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, that trade was buoyed by leaps in the export of machine tools, automobile parts and computer components. In Africa, construction machinery and green technologies have been key exports, analysts say, while parts of Latin America have seen significant growth in electric vehicles, chemical fertilizers and electronics, among other areas.\n \n\n   \n  This trade engine was humming before the start of the trade war.\n \n\n   \n  Already the world’s manufacturing superpower, China’s rapid climb to dominate green technologies like EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and solar panels, had driven up demand from countries looking to convert to renewable energy cheaply – and concern from those accusing China of unfair competition with subsidized products.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those goods – like EVs and solar panels – were already effectively barred from the US market by high tariffs put in place in recent years, and China’s exporters have been building out trade across developing markets.\n \n\n   \n  “(China) has prepared quite well for this,” said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at the MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t some miracle of foresight thinking to predict that the United States would escalate over time its trade and technology conflict with China, but China was (expanding markets) before the trade and tech war began, and ever since it’s started, that trend has really accelerated,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as many companies had to scramble to divert business from the US market in recent months, experts say the groundwork for the pivot was laid by Beijing’s decades-long push to build out its global economic footprint – expanding trade while also bankrolling ports, terminals and highways under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also relied on an earlier push from Chinese firms to move supply chains and production centers out of China to areas from Southeast Asia to Mexico – where goods are shipped from China to be fabricated or finished.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the key for the so-called resilience of Chinese exports,” said Yao Yang, dean of the Di-shui-hu Advanced Finance Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who noted these investments began during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Without those outbound investments, I don’t think that China can cope with the shock.”\n \n\n   \n    A two-way street?\n \n\n   \n  But Beijing’s trade resilience has also raised fears that a deluge of Chinese goods into other markets will wipe out domestic industries.\n \n\n   \n  Countries have been hitting back with probes on Chinese goods, with the US and India, as well as Mexico and Brazil, together raising 79 anti-dumping and countervailing probes against Chinese goods in the first half of this year – a significant uptick from recent years before 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also calls for exports or factory relocations to come alongside greater levels of local investment, knowledge transfer and more balanced trade.\n \n\n   \n  For some Latin American countries, “deindustrialization is a big problem when Chinese companies start to invest … because they bring just the assembly, they don’t do technology and knowledge transfer,” said Diego Rodriguez, logistics and industrial practice leader at Americas Market Intelligence, a research firm in Miami, noting countries like Brazil are pushing back against this.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, the stronger flow of goods is a concern, according to Rebecca Sta Maria, former executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel as if we are being swamped. I remember one economy saying a ‘tsunami of Chinese goods coming into ASEAN.’ Of course that’s a concern to us,” said Sta Maria, now the director of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. But it wasn’t all negative, she added, because small and medium-sized businesses were using high-end components from China, making their products more competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “I know that the Chinese government has acknowledged (the concern) to some extent, so now it’s how do we manage this?”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing denies accusations that its goods are flooding markets. Its officials have instead taken Trump’s global trade shake-up as an opportunity to tout China as the reliable trade partner, while pledging to open its vast market wider to exporters and investors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Observers say some countries may also be unwilling to throw up barriers to China at a time when they are facing higher tariffs on their own goods into the US – that’s especially when there is true demand in many countries.\n \n\n   \n  In Africa, “it’s a two-way street,” said Capital Economics emerging market analyst David Omojomolo.\n \n\n   \n  “These countries (in Africa) want to industrialize… there’s a massive electricity gap across the continent – solar panels are cheap and China’s got overcapacity … they need to send them somewhere, so of course, Africa is going to benefit.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Getting squeezed’\n \n\n   \n  Even still, manufacturers across China have struggled to fill the hole left by the drop in US exports.\n \n\n   \n  Factory employees in recent months have described to CNN canceled shifts, mandatory furloughs and lost jobs as employers deciding to relocate out of China.\n \n\n   \n  Garment maker Zhang Peipei in Jiangxi province told CNN she has been able to keep her 20-year-old business afloat through smaller revenue streams coming from outside the US. But she says the unpredictable US tariff policies have already caused “serious and irreversible long-term impact” without clear alternatives.\n \n\n   \n  With her business now hanging on whether she can cut a deal with buyers in Mexico, Zhang said she didn’t feel “very confident,” even despite a potential return of some US business now, “since the US has been shaking up the foreign trade scene, the whole world is chaotic right now.”\n \n\n   \n  And there are questions about whether China’s robust trade data this year showed true demand or a short-term push to get goods out of the country to stockpile them or ship them to the US via a third country with lower tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  An analysis of US and Chinese trade data from April to July – including the height of the trade uncertainty – suggests that just less than a quarter of China’s trade diverted from the US was likely still ultimately ending up in the US, while the rest of the goods were finding alternative markets, according to Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the RAND China Research Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Still, l’m not all that confident that the final demand for all those (other) exports going to the Global South is actually going to be remaining in those countries,” he said, noting that exporters could also be building up offshore inventories as they waited to see how countries’ trade talks with the US played out.\n \n\n   \n  “The big caveat,” he added, is that “the margins of Chinese exporters are almost certainly getting squeezed … they’re maintaining high volumes in real terms, but they’re doing it by cutting prices.”\n \n\n   \n  The recent truce between Xi and Trump leaves tariffs on Chinese goods at around 47% on average, but could see the return of more US business.\n \n\n   \n  But as uncertainty remains across the global economy, a driving focus for those in China, both in the factories and the government, will be on expanding how much the country’s own consumers buy domestic-made goods.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the case for Wang, the cookware maker in Guangdong. Despite finding new clients outside the US, he is also making another pivot, directing more of his business to China’s domestic market, and less of it outside, he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"Tracking States’ Unprecedented Redistricting Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, both Republicans and Democrats have engaged in aggressive, politically motivated redistricting efforts in an attempt to gain an advantage in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.

By Amy O’Kruk, Ethan Cohen, Renée Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  But not all states are agreeing to redraw their maps. The latest development is in Indiana, where the Republican leader of the state Senate  says there isn’t enough support  to redistrict in that state. Despite that announcement, Republican Gov. Mike Braun has continued to call for the legislature to vote on a new map.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, the Trump administration  sued California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/opioid-settlement-oxycontin-purdue-sackler","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:32:00-05:00","title":"Judge Approves Opioid Settlement with Purdue Pharma and Sackler Family","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal bankruptcy court judge, Sean Lane, has approved a $7 billion settlement between Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, resolving decades-long lawsuits over the opioid crisis linked to over 900,000 deaths since 1999.

family \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic.\n \n\n   \n  The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion and give up ownership. The new agreement replaces one the US Supreme Court  rejected  last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies that totaled about $50 billion. It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could “conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.” But without that possibility, he said: “The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.”\n \n\n   \n    The opposition is much quieter this time around\n \n\n   \n  The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.\n \n\n   \n  The US Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for  Sackler family members  to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don’t opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there’s been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn’t vote.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn’t bar prosecutors from pursuing.\n \n\n   \n  A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn’t enough.\n \n\n   \n  “The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.\n \n\n   \n    Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements\n \n\n   \n  A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There’s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven’t had a say.\n \n\n   \n  The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026.\n \n\n   \n  There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from  museums  and  universities .\n \n\n   \n  And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.\n \n\n   \n    Some people hurt by Purdue’s opioids would receive some money\n \n\n   \n  Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue’s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.\n \n\n   \n  All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. It would take up to 15 years for governments to receive their full allocations.\n \n\n   \n  About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue’s opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive.\n \n\n   \n  People will have until March 1 to agree not to sue the Sacklers and apply for the funds.\n \n\n   \n  One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn’t help people with substance use disorder.\n \n\n   \n  “Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can’t do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. “Some Sacklers are bad people,” he said, “but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers  have been dropping  in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/middleeast/gaza-rain-floods-camps-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Heavy Rainfall Floods Camps of Displaced Palestinians in Gaza","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rainfall in Gaza has flooded the tents of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians, worsening their already dire living conditions.

up a roadblock to Trump’s redistricting push \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:03 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the latest sign of  resistance to President Donald Trump’s push  to redraw congressional lines, the Republican leader of Indiana’s state Senate on Friday said his chamber won’t meet for a special session to create additional GOP seats.\n \n\n   \n  Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said there aren’t enough votes to pass a new map.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state’s congressional maps,” Bray said in a statement. “Today, I’m announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun – who had called the special session at the behest of Trump, Vice President JD Vance and the president’s political allies – indicated he would not relent from his demand that lawmakers gather to vote on new lines.\n \n\n   \n  “I called for our legislators to convene to ensure Hoosiers’ voices in Washington, DC are not diluted by the democrats’ gerrymandering,” Braun said in a statement. “Our state senators need to do the right thing and show up to vote for fair maps. Hoosiers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on important issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Indiana is the latest stumbling block in Trump’s high-stakes quest to remake congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Republican lawmakers in Kansas also have resisted calls to open a special session to redraw the state’s congressional map, although Kansas lawmakers could weigh new lines targeting the state’s lone congressional Democrat when legislators return for their regular session early next year.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats need to gain just three seats in the US House after next year’s midterms to take control of the chamber and potentially block parts of Trump’s agenda during the final two years of his White House term.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana Republicans hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate. They also hold seven of the state’s nine congressional districts — but Trump had eyed the Democratic-held 1st District in northwestern Indiana and the 7th District in Indianapolis as possible avenues to add Republican-leaning districts and bolster his party’s narrow House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the mid-decade redistricting arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to create five additional GOP-friendly seats. So far, GOP-led mapmaking efforts have redrawn seats in four states – Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio – to add a total of nine potential seats to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Californians voted by a large margin to approve five additional Democratic-friendly districts, which represents the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state. On Thursday, the Trump administration’s Justice Department  joined a legal challenge  that seeks to block the California map from going into effect.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/boat-strikes-trump-due-process-polling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:08:00Z","title":"Trump’s boat strikes appear quite unpopular, as Americans again support due process","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes growing public opposition to President Donald Trump’s military strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, which the U.S. military has carried out without legal process or judicial oversight.

appear quite unpopular, as Americans again support due process \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:08 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump began rapidly deporting migrants earlier this year to a brutal Salvadoran prison – including  some wrongfully so  – without due process, Democrats were  somewhat wary of pushing back .\n \n\n   \n  Yes, the move appeared illegal and highly problematic. But didn’t Americans just want undocumented immigrants deported? By standing up for due process, didn’t Democrats risk looking like they were siding with people in the country illegally – or even alleged gang members?\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turned out Americans could separate those two things in their minds. In large part because of the heavy-handedness of his deportations, Trump’s immigration agenda has suffered a series of defeats in court and  fallen out of favor  with the public.\n \n\n   \n  Despite reducing the number of illegal border-crossings to  record lows , Trump is somehow  underwater on immigration  polling.\n \n\n   \n  We could now be seeing a similar dynamic playing out with Trump’s  legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats  in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out these strikes without a legal process or offering public evidence of its justifications. The administration has likened the fight against drug-traffickers to a literal war and  said that allows it  to use war-like powers.\n \n\n   \n  Despite carrying out these strikes for more than two months and  killing 80 people now , we hadn’t had a good read on public opinion – until now. And it turns out, much like with the rapid deportations, the American public has real concerns.\n \n\n   \n  A new  Reuters-Ipsos poll  released Friday found Americans oppose such strikes by a wide margin, 51%-29%.\n \n\n   \n  The question asked whether people supported “authorizing the US military to kill suspected drug traffickers outside of the US without judicial process.”\n \n\n   \n  Independents opposed this 53%-22%. About twice as many Americans overall strongly opposed it (34%) as strongly supported it (15%). And even 27% of Republicans opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  Those are the kinds of numbers that would seem to suggest real political danger for Trump – and might embolden Democrats or other critics to start speaking out a little more forcefully.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the extraordinary nature of these strikes and major legal questions hanging over them, those critics thus far have been relatively quiet. And they certainly haven’t sought to elevate this issue to a top priority.\n \n\n   \n  We do have the likes of libertarian Republican Sen. Rand Paul speaking out pretty forcefully. Paul has called the strikes “extrajudicial killings.” He and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with nearly all Senate Democrats last month to rein in Trump’s authority on the boat strikes, although the measure ultimately did not pass.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawmakers have agitated for more briefings from the administration, which hasn’t publicly offered a legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s clear Democrats have decided to treat the issue somewhat gently, perhaps fearing they will look like they’re standing up for drug-traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, even  expressed confidence in the underlying intelligence . Warner suggested that, whatever other concerns people have about the strikes – and he expressed worries himself about the administration’s transparency – they shouldn’t be too concerned about them hitting innocent people.\n \n\n   \n  But just days later, the Associated Press reported that some who were killed in the strikes appear to have been  small-time criminals and amateurs , rather than the “narco-terrorists” the administration has said it’s targeting.\n \n\n   \n  This appears very much a live issue that will keep evolving. And the survey suggests those who would raise concerns have plenty of the public behind them.\n \n\n   \n  But actually, that shouldn’t be too surprising.\n \n\n   \n  Over and over again, polls have suggested the American people are actually quite interested in upholding the principle of due process – the principle that says, yes, these might be criminals, but we should probably make sure of that and have some accountability. And that even goes for noncitizens.\n \n\n   \n  A May  Public Religion Research Institute poll  showed Americans opposed the government deporting undocumented migrants to prisons in El Salvador and other countries “without allowing them to challenge their deportation in court,” 61%-37%.\n \n\n   \n  A June  poll from Vanderbilt University  showed support for deportations dropped from 51% to 39% when you add the qualifier that it would be done “without a formal hearing before a judge in an immigration court.”\n \n\n   \n  And a May  Reuters-Ipsos poll  showed Americans said 55%-41% that people suspected of being in the country illegally were entitled to due process. Independents agreed with that 63%-36%, and even 22% of Republicans agreed.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll see if these data – and perhaps the recent election results suggesting Trump is at a low point politically – inject lawmakers with more willingness to fight this battle.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, the downside of not speaking out more forcefully also appears to be coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Just this week, a report from human rights groups alleged that dozens of Venezuelans who were sent to the El Salvador prison were  subjected to torture  and other serious abuses like sexual violence. The report also echoed previous reporting that, contrary to the administration’s claims, there is little evidence many of these migrants were the hardened criminals or gang members the administration said they were.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, you could understand why Americans might be skeptical of not just imprisoning people without due process, but killing them.\n \n\n   \n  And it seems they are.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/walmart-doug-mcmillon-customers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"How Walmart’s CEO made it the store for literally everyone","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Under the leadership of CEO Doug McMillon, Walmart transformed from a discount-focused retailer serving low-income customers into a modern, inclusive, and omnichannel business that attracts shoppers across all income levels.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Walmart’s run as America’s largest retailer appeared to be in jeopardy when Doug McMillon became Walmart’s chief executive 11 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart’s business was struggling, its public image was reeling from a  bribery scandal  in Mexico that reached top leaders, and protesters rallied outside stores  nationwide  over low pay and working conditions. “Walmart is falling apart before our eyes,” one analyst  said .\n \n\n   \n  But today, Walmart has never been stronger. The company’s stock recently hit all-time highs. Sales are surging, even as rivals such as Target, Home Depot and others slump. And Walmart raised wages and expanded benefits, becoming a business school  case study  on employee retention.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that is thanks to McMillon, who announced Friday that he’s  retiring  soon as CEO. He oversaw Walmart’s transformation from a brick-and-mortar discount superstore that largely appealed to lower-income Americans to an everything store, everywhere for everyone.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon, a Walmart lifer who took the top job at 47 as the company’s youngest CEO since founder Sam Walton, reinvented Walmart by threading one of the thinnest needles in retail: reaching new shoppers online while retaining old customers in stores. Walmart under McMillon used its unparalleled size to press suppliers into keeping prices ultra-low, all while adding new higher-end brands and growing online to attract a wealthier clientele.\n \n\n   \n  And McMillon accomplished this pivot while navigating contentious political and social issues in America that have engulfed many companies, such as Target and Bud Light.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon’s successor, veteran Walmart leader John Furner, will have to handle these challenges, as well as pressure from President Donald Trump’s tariffs and an uncertain future of shopping with AI.  Walmart  recently said it’s partnering with OpenAI to let users browse and make purchases directly through chatbot ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n    Walmart’s transformation\n \n\n   \n  Low and middle-income shoppers historically formed the customer base of Walmart’s superstores in rural and suburban America.\n \n\n   \n  But Walmart has increasingly drawn higher-income customers in recent years. Shoppers making more than $100,000 a year have  fueled  Walmart’s growth in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart’s grocery business has underpinned its success. More than half of Walmart’s sales come from groceries, and the company has used its size and scale to muscle down prices and  invest  in improving its meat and produce aisles. That has benefitted Walmart throughout McMillon’s tenure, particularly during the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent America searching for value that Walmart could help deliver.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Walmart under McMillon has built a strong e-commerce business to compete with Amazon and draw shoppers online. It has added the option to buy online and pick up in store to thousands of its locations and Walmart+, its same-day grocery delivery membership.\n \n\n   \n  Although Amazon leads e-commerce sales in the United States by a wide margin, accounting for 40.6% of sales,  Walmart comes in second  with 9.4%, according to market research firm eMarketer.\n \n\n   \n  “The most notable change during McMillon’s tenure has been Walmart’s evolution into a major e-commerce company,” said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Placer.ai.\n \n\n   \n    Political culture wars\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also has deftly steered Walmart through political culture wars on guns, LGBTQ rights, immigration, the Confederate flag and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart, historically a conservative company based in deep-red Arkansas, appeals to a wide swath of America.\n \n\n   \n  It has worked carefully to stake out positions in the political middle to avoid offending customers and employees, and taken a slow, gradual approach to changing policies such as  gun and ammunition  sales. Dan Bartlett, the former communications director for President George W. Bush, has helped shape Walmart’s do-no-harm public affairs strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “Politics moves around,” McMillon  said  in a 2017 interview. “We are on our 11th administration, since Walmart was born. There will be a 12th. There will be a 13th.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:08:00Z","title":"Why markets are suddenly on edge","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Markets are experiencing a sharp downturn in November 2025, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 3.5% and facing its first losing month since March.

Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:08 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For months, it felt like nothing could knock stocks off their steady ascent — but November has been a rough month on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down almost 3.5% this month and on track for its first losing month since March. The Nasdaq has shed roughly $1.74 trillion in market value in two weeks as investors have dumped tech stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks opened sharply lower Friday before bouncing off their lows as investors bought the dip. The major indexes wavered into the closing bell. The Nasdaq turned positive and closed higher by 0.13% after briefly falling almost 1.9%. The S&P 500 fluctuated and closed lower by 0.05%. The Dow fell 310 points, or 0.65%.\n \n\n   \n  “Stocks were set for another horrific session at the open following yesterday’s debacle but investors saw the sharp dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  The benchmark S&P 500 is still down 1.55% this month while the Dow is down 0.87%. The S&P 500 has shed more than $1.3 trillion in market value in just over two weeks as it has retreated from a record high set in late October.\n \n\n   \n  After months of gains, investors have outsized expectations, making them easer to disappoint. Tech stocks have become  relatively pricey .\n \n\n   \n  And after the government shutdown halted official data releases for weeks, investors are unsure what the new figures,  as government releases resume,  will show about the state of the world’s biggest economy. That, in turn, is stoking uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in December, and adding to the Wall Street jitters.\n \n\n   \n  “When the government was shut down, we could believe whatever we wanted to believe,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN’s Matt Egan. “Now we need to be data dependent, and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   \n  Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence carried the market to new record highs this year. But now some investors are hitting pause, taking profits and reassessing whether those stocks will continue to produce superior returns.\n \n\n   \n  “With lofty valuations in AI-related stocks, it’s understandable that investors are on edge about anything that might go wrong,” Yardeni wrote in a Thursday note.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin, which can serve as a gauge of how risk-on investors are feeling, slid 4% on Friday and hovered around $94,500. The cryptocurrency has tumbled 25% since it hit a record high in early October.\n \n\n   \n    Data deluge incoming\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street and the Fed are awaiting a deluge of economic data that was delayed due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  That is contributing to mounting nerves about the Fed’s next move. Traders on Friday were pricing a 46% chance the central bank will cut rates in December, down from a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the last policy meeting, in October, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cast some doubt on whether the Fed would cut rates again this year. Fed officials — including Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who is a voter on policy moves this year — delivered remarks this week that have shown hesitancy to continue cutting rates.\n \n\n   \n  While Evercore ISI analysts in a note said they still see an interest rate cut next month, they think it’s “very hard to call” because of a combination of factors, including “data blindness.”\n \n\n   \n  The central bank’s rate cuts in September and October boosted stocks, and a pause on rate cuts could pose troubles for stocks that have rallied on expectations for lower borrowing costs — in particular, the AI and tech stocks that have propelled the market higher.\n \n\n   \n  “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday, according to  CNN’s Fear and Greed index .\n \n\n   \n  But some investors say a pullback in stocks can also be healthy.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq gained every month from April through the end of October. Now, the market is resetting as investors reassess the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “This (pullback) is somewhat overdue, and I don’t think it’s the start of a  correction ,” Yardeni said.\n \n\n   \n    AI jitters\n \n\n   \n  There is also increasing skepticism about whether Big Tech companies can make enough money to justify the enormous spending taking place on AI deals now.\n \n\n   \n  “The technology sector has faced selling pressure in recent weeks amid concerns over rising debt issuance and a surge in capital expenditures” like new data centers, Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, told CNN’s Matt Egan in an email. “Investors are questioning whether these investments will translate into future profitability.”\n \n\n   \n  Oracle shares ( ORCL ) surged 36% in one day on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Shares in Oracle have tumbled since then, erasing those gains.\n \n\n   \n  “Companies announcing large supply deals with OpenAI have similarly been met with skepticism around OpenAI’s ability to deliver on its financial objectives,” John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Oracle facing pressure. Meta shares ( META ) are down 23% since hitting a record high in mid-August. Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) are down 10% since hitting a record high in late October. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) are down 16% since hitting a record high on November 3.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s happened recently in the market isn’t even close to a tech wreck, but it may be a bit of a tech reckoning,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team.\n \n\n   \n  To Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, this month has been defined by investors rotating out of tech stocks and into other sectors.\n \n\n   \n  The recent pullback, he said, feels like “investors trying to protect profits after a really healthy run off the lows in April.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/charlotte-gregory-bovino-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:30:00-05:00","title":"U.S. Border Patrol Agents Headed to Charlotte, North Carolina – Local Officials Caught Off Guard","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that Gregory Bovino, the top U.S. Border Patrol official in the Trump administration, has been deployed to Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of a broader strategy to conduct aggressive immigration enforcement in Democratic-led urban areas.

That was news to city officials \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:30 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcolm Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers  to head to Charlotte , then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  “As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden – who initially was unaware of the operation – has been “contacted by two separate federal oﬃcials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week,” the sheriff’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office said details on the federal operation have not been shared with them and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The plans have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  US Rep. Alma Adams, whose district includes much of Charlotte, wrote she was “extremely concerned about the deployment of U.S. Border Patrol and ICE agents to Charlotte” in  a post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and what we have seen border patrol and ICE agents do in places like Chicago and Los Angeles – using excessive force in their operations and tear gassing peaceful protesters – threatens the wellbeing of the communities they enter,” Adams said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Bovino  wrote , “Immigrants rest assured, we have your back like we did in Chicago and Los Angeles,” and urged undocumented immigrants to  self-deport .\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are not involved in planning federal operations, nor have they been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in federal immigration operations and would only get involved when there are warrants or criminal behavior under its jurisdiction, so “people who need local law enforcement services should feel secure calling 911,” said Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We still don’t know any details on where they may be operating and to what extent,” Lyles  said  Thursday. “I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Lyles asked residents to refrain from sharing unverified information about enforcement activities, which create “more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the federal government has not confirmed Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year, have created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein encouraged residents who see inappropriate behavior to record it on their phones and notify local law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “We should all focus on and arrest violent criminals and drug traffickers. Unfortunately, that’s not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,” the governor said in a statement. “The vast majority of people they have detained have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials were in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out to the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting a Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/federal-data-what-to-expect-economic-data","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:54:00-05:00","title":"The government is back open.

Here’s what that means for economic data \n       \n  By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:54 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US government has reopened following its longest-ever shutdown, setting the stage for the eventual release of the gold-standard federal data that is crucial in analyzing the health and trajectory of the nation’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Data nerds  (and government officials,  and Federal Reserve policymakers , and business owners, and, well,  everyone else for that matter ),  rejoice!\n \n\n   \n  Starting next week, the backlog of federal data will start flowing, and the long-awaited September jobs report (originally due out October 3) will publish Thursday, November 20, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been like flying in fog without any instrumentation,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  However, expect some choppiness when the air starts to clear.\n \n\n   \n  The very nature of the 43-day shutdown has created an unprecedented situation: Some datapoints were not gathered when they typically should have been, increasing the potential for big holes in what’s expected to be already messy data.\n \n\n   \n    What major economic reports are outstanding?\n \n\n   \n  Since the government was dark for the entirety of October and the first dozen days of November, several reports that included data collected in September and scheduled to be released in the ensuing weeks were not delivered ( with the exception of the Consumer Price Index ), nor was data collected for October (we’ll get to that here shortly).\n \n\n   \n  Other major reports in the wings – likely in various stages of completion – include September data on wholesale inflation, import and export prices, quarterly employment costs, annual consumer expenditures, retail sales, gross domestic product and consumer spending.\n \n\n   \n    When will they be released?\n \n\n   \n  That remains to be seen.\n \n\n   \n  The leading statistical agencies are in the process of updating their schedules for economic releases (a calendar set in place more than a year ago).\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s not as simple as plugging reports into different dates. Several releases are reliant on data from other series. For example, CPI and Producer Price Index data points feed in to the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index ,  which in turn feeds in to GDP.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis – the statistical arm of the Commerce Department that estimates GDP and produces data on topics such as income, spending, foreign trade, and state and local economies – announced it is “working to update its schedule of economic releases” and is consulting with the Census Bureau, BLS and other suppliers of data used to produce the BEA’s indicators.\n \n\n   \n  Early Friday afternoon, the Census Bureau announced revised release dates for three reports originally slated to publish in early October. The August data on construction spending, manufacturers’ shipments and international trade will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Each economic data series will be affected differently by the shutdown, depending on how, when and from whom the data is collected, said Erica Groshen, a former BLS Commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n \n\n   \n  Still, she noted, expect the BLS and other agencies to prioritize  Principal Federal Economic Indicators , which are about three dozen major statistical series used to describe the condition of the US economy. (The jobs report, CPI, PPI, and PCE are among these. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover  Survey , for example, is not).\n \n\n   \n    Will we ever see the October jobs report?\n \n\n   \n  As it stands now, October 2025 could very well amount to a “lost” month of data – or close to it.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, the nation’s statistical agencies were run by skeleton crews as the actions of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data were suspended – disrupting finely tuned processes that have underpinned major economic reports for decades.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the jobs report is composed by two surveys: one of businesses and one of households. The establishment survey is primarily automated and relies upon online portals for businesses to submit their information such as workforce levels and pay. The household survey, on the other hand, is largely conducted via telephone and in-person visits.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to ask people what their situation was five weeks ago, and it’s bound to be unreliable,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “I think part of the employment report for the month of October will be lost forever, and we will only get the data that is submitted by companies.”\n \n\n   \n  The household survey is what’s used to generate labor force estimates and the unemployment rate ,  and since that wasn’t conducted in October, “we’re going to get half the employment report,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett  said on Thursday . “We’ll get the jobs part, but we won’t get the unemployment rate.”\n \n\n   \n  The lack of a complete monthly employment snapshot isn’t ideal when the US labor market entered the shutdown on seemingly shaky ground; however, a rough picture of the trajectory could still be assembled   using the payroll estimates combined with a smattering of private hiring data as well as state-level unemployment filings and layoff notices, wrote Mike Reid, senior US economist at RBC in a note Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    October inflation data likely to be quite opaque\n \n\n   \n  The  visibility on inflation  data for October will be “particularly bad,” Reid noted.\n \n\n   \n  Two-thirds of the pricing data that feeds in to the CPI is collected by in-person visits to brick-and-mortar stores, Reid said. Wholesale-level prices also were not collected in October for the Producer Price Index.\n \n\n   \n  That will then ripple through to the PCE price index, where about 90% is constructed from CPI and PPI inputs, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike the labor market, there are few (if any) reliable alternatives to the CPI report,” he said. “Absent the CPI and PPI reports, it’s hard to gauge inflation’s trajectory.”\n \n\n   \n  And if the October inflation data is released, it could pose a “serious data quality issue,” as it would likely lean more heavily on  imputation , a methodology that utilizes a variety of existing datapoints to capture missing information.\n \n\n   \n  “But we know that already when the statistical agencies have all the data available, there’s a big degree of uncertainty, and sometimes the numbers are not statistically significant,” EY-Parthenon’s Daco told CNN. “So, with even less data, the statistical significance of these numbers is likely to drop even further.”\n \n\n   \n    What about November data?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown lasted through nearly half of November, meaning that this month’s data also will not emerge unscathed, economists said. However, they also fully expect all major reports to be released.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a greater likelihood that inflation data will have a higher level of imputations, noted RBC’s Reid. The timing and staffing levels of returning BLS employees also could impact the collection of data, including the household survey for the jobs report, said former BLS Commissioner Groshen.\n \n\n   \n  “BLS has fewer resources this time, because it is down 20% in its staffing, one-third of its leadership positions are vacant, and it’s possible they had even more people quit during the course of the shutdown,” she said, referencing the Trump administration’s large-scale layoff of federal workers earlier this year via the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while it’s possible that the surveying of households in November could include questions for October, it’s unlikely, she said, noting current staffing levels and the heft of the data backlog facing statistical agencies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a very highly orchestrated way that those interviews are conducted, so just even running surveys simultaneously is problematic,” she said. “I would not be surprised if the Census Bureau and BLS just decided that they can’t run the October [household survey] again.”\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it’s possible that the BLS could estimate the October unemployment rate from the September and November data, she said.\n \n\n   \n    We might not be back on track until 2026\n \n\n   \n  “Noisy” reports aren’t out of the ordinary for major economic releases such as the jobs report. Large disruptions, including those considered relatively short term, have a way of leaving their mark on data for months (or, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, for years).\n \n\n   \n  Entering into evidence are the October 2024 and November 2024 jobs reports.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, a month impacted by two major deadly hurricanes and massive labor strikes, the initial employment snapshot showed a net gain of  just 12,000 jobs  – a far cry from September’s 223,000-job gain.\n \n\n   \n  It was also a one-time blip.\n \n\n   \n  After striking workers and weather-waylaid employees went back to work in November, the jobs report for that month showed  a surge of 227,000 jobs gained .\n \n\n   \n  When the October 2025 jobs report is released, it’s expected to show significant job losses – perhaps to the tune of 1.5 million jobs, RBC’s Reid estimates – largely because of federal workers who were not on payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  And, with the shutdown ending during the week that includes the 12th of the month – the period the BLS uses to tabulate employment – the November jobs report should capture the return of those employees and contractors to payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown gummed up the nation’s statistical machinery, and it could take a couple of weeks for everything to get sorted out and running smoothly again.\n \n\n   \n  “It’ll likely be the February period, where we get the January data, before we get our first real clean look at the US macroeconomic data,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “So, there’s a price to be paid there in terms of the quantity and quality of the data that we’re going to get until early winter 2026.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street is bracing for impact\n \n\n   \n  The privately produced data provided a sense of what the federal data could show; however, if those expectations are dashed, there is potential for wide swings in the markets, said Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  “If they hit the mark, and that’s what they show, then no harm, no foul,” he said. “If, though, the numbers come out and vary from what we expect – either on the upside on the downside – then that may call into question the Fed policy that’s been done since the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  US stocks had  their worst day in a month  Thursday and were lower Friday as traders digested news that the government had reopened. Investors braced for weeks’ worth of data set to be released in short order.\n \n\n   \n  “I say this only half-jokingly: Maybe because the government is opening up again, the market took a dive,” economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research told CNN’s Matt Egan. “When the government was shut down we could believe whatever we wanted to believe. Now we need to be data dependent and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/nnsa-nuclear-testing-white-house-meeting-exclusive","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00-05:00","title":"Exclusive: Department of Energy officials to meet with White House to tamp down Trump’s idea of explosive nuclear testing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, officials from the Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration are preparing to meet with the White House to dissuade President Donald Trump from resuming explosive nuclear weapons testing, which he suggested in October in response to Russian and North Korean nuclear activities.

Williams and officials from the US National Laboratories are planning to inform the White House that they do not think blowing up weapons for nuclear warhead testing,   as Trump suggested last month, is tenable, two sources familiar with the matter said. They asked not to be named to discuss a sensitive matter.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest sign of fallout from Trump’s October social media post instructing the Department of Defense to start testing   nuclear weapons “because of other countries testing programs.”\n \n\n   \n  But NNSA, which falls under the Department of Energy,   is the federal agency responsible for building and testing bombs and maintaining the nuclear stockpile, not the Defense Department.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official reiterated on Thursday that “because of other countries’ testing programs, President Trump has instructed the Department of War and Department of Energy to test our nuclear weapons on an equal basis.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing has been eliminated from consideration as all decision-making authority lies with the President,” the White House official added.\n \n\n   \n  Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich pushed back on the idea that agency officials would be dissuading the White House from resuming testing.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump administration continues to explore all options as it moves to expand nuclear testing on an equal basis with other nations,” Dietderich said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the US tests every part of its nuclear weapons systems except for the explosive nuclear material in warheads. The last full-scale nuclear weapons test was done in the US in 1992, and the practice was banned by former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent suggestion the US could resume nuclear testing comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted in October that Moscow had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo.\n \n\n   \n  “The reason I’m saying — testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test,” Trump told “60 Minutes” recently. “If you notice, North Korea’s testing constantly. Other countries are testing,” he said, adding: “I don’t wanna be the only country that doesn’t test.”\n \n\n   \n  At the upcoming White House meeting, NNSA and DOE officials will be prepared to tell the administration that “there’s not going to be any testing” involving exploding nuclear materials and will seek to steer the White House into a workable plan that doesn’t involve blowing anything up, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  The source said officials hoped it would give the president the opportunity to align himself with NNSA’s approach.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has the authority to order the tests anyway if he doesn’t agree with the nuclear experts.\n \n\n   \n  An NNSA spokesperson declined to comment. “NNSA does not comment on ongoing or potential private meetings with the White House, especially regarding matters of nuclear security,” NNSA spokesperson Mariza Smajlaj told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Mere minutes before he was due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Korea last month, Trump took to Truth Social to say that he had directed the “Department of War” to “start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Inside the NNSA, Trump’s initial October suggestion was met with confusion, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody saw this coming,” one of them said.\n \n\n   \n  Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, told Fox News  earlier this month  that US nuclear tests are “system tests” and “not nuclear explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  A senior White House official, when pressed this week on what exactly the president meant by his initial comments, told CNN that Trump was being “purposefully vague” in his calls to resume nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The official argued the president became fixated on the idea while on his trip to Asia, telling CNN that some foreign leaders brought the issue up to Trump directly while he was abroad.  \n \n\n   \n  Another   administration official argued that they viewed the president’s comments as wanting to do more testing on nuclear-capable missiles, rather than detonating nuclear bombs.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Trump’s comments haven’t changed agency policy: No plans are underway for exploding nuclear weapons for testing purposes. One source told CNN that no one in the administration has explained to those in the agency what exactly Trump meant by his comments.\n \n\n   \n  NNSA officials recently prepared a memo for Wright and Williams outlining all the things the agency does to make sure its weapons are up to speed, including supercomputer bomb simulations and test flights of non-explosive warheads, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That memo also lays out what the timeline would be if the administration directed NNSA to go back to nuclear testing like Trump had suggested. One source said it would take 36 months of underground testing at a minimum to obtain scientifically useful data, but that timeline could get much longer if the federal government were sued by environmental or other groups to delay or stop the testing.\n \n\n   \n  “If they wanted to just make the ground shake, you could probably do that sooner, but there wouldn’t be a purpose to the test beyond political signaling,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  If the US returned to nuclear testing, it would be done in Nevada – at the only underground site designed to explode nuclear weapons. That space sits on federal land in a vast desert, but the state government would also need to sign off on the testing – another thorny issue.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a big resistance from states about dealing with nuclear materials like we used to,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  There is also the matter of legacy cleanup of nuclear waste due to decades of nuclear testing in Nevada. Testing has had devastating health impacts on nearby downwind communities, from radiation exposure to illnesses like cancer.\n \n\n   \n  There is no need for weapons testing, as the US still has a lot of “really good data” from Cold War-era nuclear testing, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  There are concerns that if the US resumed testing, China could also use it as an excuse to perform nuclear   tests — something it says  it is not currently doing  — raising the geopolitical temperature across the globe.\n \n\n   \n  Neither Beijing nor Moscow have tested a nuclear warhead in many decades, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about whether the Trump administration has more intelligence on Russia and China’s nuclear activities than what is publicly known, a person who worked in the West Wing during Trump’s first term, including on national security issues, told CNN: “It would be hard for either country to blow up nuclear warheads underground and keep that quiet. That’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-student-murders-restitution","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-06:00","title":"Convicted killer Bryan Kohberger must reimburse families for their daughters’ urns","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, an Idaho state judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students — including Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen — must reimburse their families for the cost of their urns, totaling about $3,000.

Bryan Kohberger  must pay for the urns of two of the University of Idaho students he killed, an Idaho state judge ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s ruling comes after prosecutors asked the judge at a

withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group,” a representative for private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners told CNN. “We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and will work hard to secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers.”\n \n\n   \n  RedBird’s decision not to pursue The Telegraph throws a wrench in the outlet’s bid to grow its business in the United States, even as its rivals — including the Daily Mail, the BBC and The Guardian — have expanded in North America over the last few years.\n \n\n   \n  The reversal comes months after RedBird announced in May that  it had reached an in-principle agreement  to acquire The Telegraph Media Group for roughly $657 million. At the time, that deal seemed to mark the end of the media company’s two-year saga   to find new ownership.\n \n\n   \n  Under the deal, RedBird was to become the sole controlling owner of The Telegraph, the right-leaning British newspaper founded in 1855. The private equity firm was set to invest in The Telegraph’s digital operation in a bid to expand the outlet’s foothold in the US and grow subscriptions overall.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph’s sale was long stymied by the British government’s restrictions on foreign government investments in media ownership, which capped foreign state-owned investments into a publisher at 15%.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird, with the help of International Media Investments (IMI) — an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed   a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family — helped the Barclay family regain control of The Telegraph in December 2023, but the British government barred the transfer of ownership.\n \n\n   \n  The May 2025 deal would have allowed IMI to retain a 15% investment, meeting that limit.

In August, a coalition of human rights and freedom of expression organisations raised similar concerns in  an open letter  to Britain’s secretary of state for culture, media and sport.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird has denied the alleged ties to Beijing.

Jamie Raskin alleged correspondence between Maxwell and her lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Leah Saffian, a California-based attorney who has long-represented Maxwell, said in  a statement : “The release to the media by Congressman Raskin (Dem., Maryland), of Ms. Maxwell’s privileged client-attorney email correspondence with me is as improper as it is a denial of justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Saffian added that employees at the prison have been met with “appropriate consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have been terminated for improper, unauthorized access to the email system used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to allow inmates to communicate with the outside world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Bryan prison, Bureau of Prisons and the Justice Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,  released  what he said was information about Maxwell’s life inside the Bryan prison — including  special privileges  being afforded to the late-Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman — that was shared with Raskin by a whistleblower.\n \n\n   \n  The whistleblower also told Raskin that Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, is in the process of preparing to file an application for commutation. According to an email that the whistleblower shared with the committee, Maxwell wrote to Saffian in early October that she planned to send materials “through the warden.”\n \n\n   \n  House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Friday defended how they received and released the information and disputed that the correspondence was privileged.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Judiciary Committee Minority’s letter was based on a range of documents and information shared with Committee staff by a whistleblower. None of the documents shared with the Committee from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) TRULINCS system was subject to the attorney client privilege,” a House Judiciary Democratic spokeswoman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The spokeswoman pointed out that individuals have to accept a disclaimer that their activity will be monitored once logging into the prison’s systems. She said the disclaimer makes clear that DOJ may monitor the system and that users must consent to such monitoring and have no expectation that communications will stay private.\n \n\n   \n  Pertaining to attorney client privilege specifically, the Judiciary spokeswoman said the disclaimer includes this or similar language: “I understand and consent that this provision applies to electronic messages both to and from my attorney or other legal representative, and that such electronic messages will not be treated as privileged communications, and that I have alternative methods of conducting privileged legal communication.”\n \n\n   \n  Raskin offered no description of the whistleblower — a typical practice meant to protect the person’s identity. The Democratic spokeswoman added the committee “won’t comment on any information that could identify whistleblowers, including whistleblowers’ employment status” and decried “any effort by BOP to intimidate, silence, or retaliate against anyone” who shared information.\n \n\n   \n  In her Friday statement, Saffian also wrote: “Contrary to Rep. Raskin’s assertion, Ms. Maxwell has not requested a commutation — or made a Pardon — application to the second Trump Administration. Prior to any such application a Prisoner needs to demonstrate that all possible avenues of appeal have been exhausted.”\n \n\n   \n  (Raskin did not say Maxwell had requested a commutation or pardon application; he said Maxwell was in the process of working on a commutation application.)\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/sweden-bus-crash-fatalities-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:37:00+00:00","title":"Several people killed in bus crash in Stockholm, police say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bus crash in central Stockholm on Friday resulted in multiple casualties, with six people injured or killed, though specific details remain unclear.

protesters  blocked the main entrance to the  United Nations climate conference  on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon for 90 minutes on Friday in a peaceful standoff that ended after a lengthy discussion with the climate talks president, who cradled a protester’s baby during the talks.\n \n\n   \n  Brazilian military personnel kept demonstrators from entering the site hosting  COP30 meetings in Belem , but there appeared to be no physical altercations. The protesters, most in traditional Indigenous garb, formed a human chain around the entrance to block people from entering as the day’s meetings began. Other groups of activists formed a secondary chain around them.\n \n\n   \n  “No one enters, no one leaves,” was one of the main chants of the demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  It was the second time in four days that protesters disrupted climate talks that organizers have promoted as empowering and celebrating native peoples.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the Munduruku Indigenous group led the demonstration that blocked the main entrance, demanding a meeting with Brazilian President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva .\n \n\n   \n  “President Lula, we are here in front of COP because we want you to listen to us. We refuse to be sacrificed for agribusiness,’’ protesters said in a written statement in Portuguese released by the Munduruku Ipereg Ayu Movement. “Our forest is not for sale. We are the ones who protect the climate, and the Amazon cannot continue to be destroyed to enrich large corporations.”\n \n\n   \n  Munduruku leaders had a series of demands for Brazil. They included revoking plans for commercial development of rivers, canceling a grain railway project that has raised fears of deforestation and clearer demarcations of Indigenous territories. They also want a rejection of deforestation carbon credits.\n \n\n   \n  During the 90 minutes of blockage, conference participants were rerouted and delegates entered the venue through another door. U.N. staff rushed to move metal detectors to the side entrance as hundreds of people formed long lines. The protest at the front of the venue began at around 7:30 a.m., with the main entrance blocked about 30 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  Conference president André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, met with the group as they blocked the entrance.

Donald J. Trump, et al. was filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County,” Skandalakis wrote in a statement Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said.\n \n\n   \n  “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment. Out of respect for their privacy and professional discretion, I will not identify those prosecutors or disclose their reasons for declining,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  A status/pretrial conference has been scheduled for December 1 with Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee, but the accused defendants are not required to attend.\n \n\n   \n  “The State should be prepared to announce whether it intends to seek a superseding indictment,” McAfee wrote in Friday’s notice calling for the conference.\n \n\n   \n  Skandalakis said he just recently received the investigative file from Willis’ office, including 101 boxes of documents delivered to him on October 29 and an eight-terabyte hard drive just over a week ago on November 6. Willis’ office declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  “With Judge McAfee’s deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case. This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed,” Skandalakis wrote on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Michael J. Moore, former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, is skeptical the case will move ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “If the history between the Trump cases and Mr. Skandalakis foretells the future, these cases are dead on arrival,” he said. Moore also said he expects to see a recitation of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision as a basis for declining and dismissal, and is not surprised that no other prosecutor stepped forward. Moore referred to the cases as “overcharged” by using RICO.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be a thankless job, akin to being invited to the center ring at the circus and then told that your job was to clean up after the elephants,” Moore said.\n \n\n   \n  The  historic state racketeering charges  were filed on August 14, 2023, by Willis, an elected Democrat who launched a lengthy investigation into Trump’s alleged interference in the Georgia election in early 2021. The investigation began shortly after a  January phone call  became public in which Trump pressured Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to “find” the votes necessary for him to win the state in the Presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  “This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end. We remain confident that a fair and impartial review will lead to a dismissal of the case against President Trump,” Trump’s lead Georgia attorney Steve Sadow told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile case by the Fulton County prosecutor peaked in dramatic fashion when Trump surrendered in the Atlanta jail for a little over 20 minutes in August 2023, where he was forced to provide his mug shot for the first time. The case was seen as the most likely of the various criminal charges surrounding Trump to go to trial because it was a state case handled by a local Georgia prosecutor, rather than federal charges that could be pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was charged alongside 18 co-defendants on sweeping charges using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the state law commonly  referred to as RICO , similar to the federal version of the statute that was famously used to target criminal enterprises like the mafia.\n \n\n   \n  After a long-running investigation, Willis accused Trump and his allies of breaking several laws by participating in a conspiracy to unlawfully change the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n \n\n   \n    Several Trump allies involved in case\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the president, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was the highest-ranking official charged, along with former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who reached an agreement with two Georgia election officials this year to  settle a nearly $150 million defamation lawsuit.  \n \n\n   \n  Trump and his accused co-defendants “joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome” of the election, prosecutors alleged in the indictment, which said they “unlawfully conspired and endeavored to conduct and participate in criminal enterprise” after Trump lost the election in Georgia to Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  Sadow, Trump’s lead Georgia defense attorney on the case, vigorously maintained his client’s innocence during the ongoing legal process, along with attorneys who represented many of the co-defendants also charged in the unique racketeering conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants vehemently denied any wrongdoing, some arguing they were simply trying to rectify what they believed were serious irregularities that tainted the 2020 election results.\n \n\n   \n  Four of the 19 defendants in Willis’ case, including three attorneys directly involved in Trump’s bid to overturn the election results in the Peach State, accepted plea deals, in some cases pleading guilty to felony charges in exchange for more lenient sentencing recommendations.\n \n\n   \n  Thirty  “unindicted co-conspirators”  were also named in the high-profile case — a freight train that was barreling down the tracks simultaneously as Trump was campaigning for his second run at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Then in a  wild unexpected twist  in early 2024, Michael Roman, a campaign official for Trump in 2020, filed a motion that eventually got Willis disqualified from prosecuting the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help in the investigation. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, after Willis’ dramatic televised testimony put her personal life in the spotlight, Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee found that there was not enough evidence to firmly prove that Willis financially benefited from the relationship, and allowed Willis to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down, which he later did.\n \n\n   \n  However, the legal proceedings against Trump and several co-defendants were officially paused in June 2024 when a Georgia appeals court reviewed potential misconduct by Willis.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, the appeals court officially disqualified Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Then the final dagger for Willis came in September, when  The Georgia Supreme Court declined  to hear an appeal from the Fulton County district attorney on  her removal .\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/science/mind-captioning-translate-visual-thoughts-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00.000-05:00","title":"Scientist turns people’s mental images into text using ‘mind-captioning’ technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Japanese scientist, Tomoyasu Horikawa, has developed a new AI-based technology called 'mind-captioning' that translates brain scans into descriptive text by analyzing visual mental images.

The participants viewed 2,180 videos without sound that were seconds long and varied in content among objects, scenes and actions.\n \n\n   \n  Large language models — generative AI systems trained on large datasets —   took   captions of the video clips and turned those captions into sequences of numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Horikawa trained separate, simpler AI models, known as “decoders,” to match the scanned brain activity related to the video clips to the numerical sequences.\n \n\n   \n  He then used   the decoders to interpret the study participants’ brain activity while   they watched or recalled videos that the AI had not encountered during the training process.   Another algorithm was created to progressively generate word sequences that best matched the decoded brain activity.\n \n\n   \n  As the AI learned from the data, the descriptive text tool   became better and better at using the brain scans to describe the videos the participants had watched.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just one additional step forward in the direction of what, in my view, we can legitimately call brain-reading or mind-reading,” Marcello Ienca, a professor of the ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich in Germany and president-elect of the International Neuroethics Society, told CNN. He was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n    Potential for ‘profound’ health interventions\n \n\n   \n  The AI model generated text in English, even though the participants were not native English speakers.\n \n\n   \n  The method can create comprehensive descriptions of visual content, even without using the activity in language-related regions of the brain, or the “language network,” Horikawa said, “indicating that this method can be used even when someone has damage around that language network.”\n \n\n   \n  The technology could potentially be used to assist people with aphasia, who struggle with language expression due to damage around the language network; or  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects speech, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this study paves the way for some profound interventions for people who have difficulty communicating, including non-verbal autistic people,” said psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, a lecturer at Barnard College in New York who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  However, “we have to use it carefully and make sure we aren’t being invasive and that everyone consents to it,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The ultimate privacy challenge’\n \n\n   \n  The success of this method — which could be applied to decode the thoughts of infants or animals, or the content of dreams — “raises ethical concerns” regarding privacy, with the possibility of disclosing an individual’s private thoughts before they have verbalized them, the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  If in the future this technology is used by consumers beyond biomedical purposes, “I think this is the ultimate privacy challenge,” Ienca said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that there are many companies, such as  Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant startup , that are making public claims about soon developing neural implants for the general population.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get there, then we need to have very, very strict rules when it comes to granting access to people’s minds and brains,” Ienca said, highlighting that our brains include “sensitive information” such as “signatures of early dementia and psychiatric disorders and depression.”\n \n\n   \n  A study published in the journal  Cell  in August suggested that the “leakage” of private inner thoughts during decoding could be prevented by a mechanism in which the user thinks of a particular keyword to unlock the decoding tool only when intended.\n \n\n   \n  The “neuroscience is moving fast and the assistive potential is huge — but mental privacy and freedom of thought protections can’t wait,” said social scientist Łukasz Szoszkiewicz, an assistant professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and a director of European Affairs at the Neurorights Foundation in New York.\n \n\n   \n  “We should treat neural data as sensitive by default, require explicit purpose-limited consent, and prioritize on-device processing with user-controlled ‘unlock’ mechanisms. Reliance on AI introduces additional regulatory and cybersecurity challenges and underscores the need for complementary, AI-specific legal framework,” Szoszkiewicz, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, Horikawa noted that the method used in his study requires a large amount of data collection, with the cooperation of active participants. So, while the technology is useful for neuroscientific research, it is “not so accurate for practical use,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Also, the videos used in the study included typical scenes of, for example, a dog biting a man, but not more unusual scenes — say, a man biting a dog. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the technique could be used to capture less predictable mental images.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, “while some people may worry that this technology poses serious risk to mental privacy,” in reality, “the current approach cannot easily read a person’s private thoughts,” Horikawa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/china/shenzhou-20-crew-return-earth-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Chinese astronauts arrive home after suspected debris strike delays return to Earth","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three Chinese astronauts from the Shenzhou-20 mission returned to Earth more than a week late due to a suspected debris strike that caused a crack in their return capsule's window.

astronauts arrive home after suspected debris strike delays return to Earth \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday more than a week later than their scheduled arrival, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris strike left their spaceship with a cracked window.\n \n\n   \n  The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China’s Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they’d even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.\n \n\n   \n  But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).\n \n\n   \n  Medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  “The path of humanity’s exploration of space is not smooth,” Chen Dong, one of the astronauts, told journalists in front of the capsule. “It is full of difficulties and challenges, and that is also why we choose to walk this path.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very proud that we successfully completed the mission…We have finally made it home safely.”\n \n\n   \n  The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China’s Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.\n \n\n   \n  Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a  nine-hour sortie , and it’s about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.\n \n\n   \n  The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.\n \n\n   \n  The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed  bans on Chinese citizens  with US visas participating in NASA programs.\n \n\n   \n  The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts who have been left in limbo. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, for example, spent 371 days on the ISS — a US record — after a tiny piece of space debris struck his Russian Soyuz spacecraft and forced a monthslong extension to his trip. Roscosmos launched a replacement capsule that eventually carried Rubio and cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams saw their weeklong stay on the International Space Station stretch into a more than nine-month mission after their spacecraft malfunctioned during a test flight. They joined the ISS expedition crew   and eventually  returned home  in March.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/uk/king-charles-iii-77th-birthday-photo-intl-scli-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"New photo released to mark King Charles III’s 77th birthday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III’s 77th birthday was celebrated with a new photo released by Buckingham Palace, showing him tending to a maple sapling at Sandringham Estate.

briefed this week on options for military operations inside Venezuela as he continues to mull a path forward in the country, four sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to decide on how to proceed, and he continues to weigh the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign. The president has previously voiced reservations about taking military action meant to oust Nicolas Maduro, concerned about whether it would prove effective.\n \n\n   \n  While Wednesday’s briefing included an updated set of options for the president to consider, it did not indicate that he’s closer to making a decision, one of the people said. Another source familiar with the briefing said the options were similar to those that have been discussed within the Pentagon, and some publicly reported, in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The target options – which United States Southern Command has stood up planning cells to develop – are part of an operation dubbed “SOUTHERN SPEAR,” according to a senior US official aware of the planning. They were presented by top officials on Trump’s national security team, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the operation on X Thursday night, though he did not reveal details.\n \n\n   \n  “Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Command had  previously announced  an operation called Operation Southern Spear in January. An announcement at the time said it would utilize “long-dwell robotic surface vessels, small robotic interceptor boats, and vertical take-off and landing robotic air vessels” to help with counternarcotics operations.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Southern Spear. The White House did not comment on the briefing. CBS News was first to report on the briefing.\n \n\n   \n   The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” arrived in the Caribbean this week amid a massive scale-up of US military resources.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including  air strikes  on military or government facilities and drug trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN had  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action at all. Administration officials told lawmakers last week that the US  didn’t have a legal justification  that would support attacks against any land targets – though it is possible they could generate one. And Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/style/katseye-creative-director-humberto-leon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00-05:00","title":"Katseye: The Rise of a Multiracial, Fashion-Forward Girl Group","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Katseye, a multiracial girl group formed from the Netflix show 'Pop Star Academy,' has emerged as a groundbreaking force in global pop culture.

Humberto Leon is the mastermind behind their image \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:28 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two years ago, six young women — Sophia, Lara, Manon, Daniela, Megan and Yoonchae — went from relative obscurity to internet fame when the Netflix reality show, “Pop Star Academy,” turned them into the now-Grammy-nominated girl group Katseye.\n \n\n   \n  As their names were called out in the finale, the newly appointed members — who beat 120,000 other contestants vying for a spot — hugged and congratulated each other through sobs, each in matching gray blazer-skirt suits, styled with white shirts, knee-high socks and black shoes — mimicking the kind of attire worn by South Korean secondary students.\n \n\n   \n  The group is backed by Hybe Corporation, which brought K-pop to a global audience through mega artists like BTS, and Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record company and owner of Geffen Records. Together they sought to create the world’s first mainstream multiracial girl group modeled on  the traditional K-pop framework , which includes catchy melodies, synchronized dance moves and a strong emphasis on aesthetic appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Katseye’s members have   since stepped out in many head-turning looks, from the revealing red leather stage outfits worn in August for their Lollapalooza music festival performance, which drew record-breaking crowds, to the glitzy Dolce & Gabbana dresses worn for  their MTV VMAs red carpet debut  a month later. Earlier in the summer, they fronted  a viral campaign for Gap  while dancing   in low-rise denim to the 2003 Kelis song “Milkshake.” On other occasions, they’ve dipped into luxury brand archives and worn pieces from the likes of Prada, Hussein Chalayan and early 2000s Balenciaga designed by Nicolas Ghesquière. And as they embark on their first solo tour across North America — the tickets for which sold out in minutes — more eye-catching ensembles are sure to feature.\n \n\n   \n  The creative mastermind behind the band’s image is Humberto Leon, a former fashion entrepreneur and designer. Today, as Katseye’s creative director, Leon styles the members from head to toe, weighing in on every detail from the accessories to hair and makeup. In short, anything to do with their visual image falls under Leon’s purview.\n \n\n   \n  “There was this kind of feeling of tomboy meets rebellion,” Leon told CNN over a video call from Los Angeles, as he reflected on Katseye’s first appearance as a group. “The uniforms added a fun storytelling aspect.”\n \n\n   \n  School uniforms are a popular and recurring trope in pop culture (see a 16-year-old  Britney Spears in schoolgirl attire  in the music video for “Baby One More Time”). Several K-pop girl groups, including Girls’ Generation, Red Velvet and 2NE1, have also previously worn them, as they convey a youthful and fresh image. But Katseye’s look had subtle touches that pushed the common visual motif forward, according to Leon, whose subversive approach to fashion over a decades-long career has often appealed to hip audiences. “We wanted to differentiate,” he explained, “so all the jackets were actually boys’ blazers.”\n \n\n   \n    Bringing cultures together\n \n\n   \n  K-pop has gained significant mainstream traction over the years, but Katseye (which was trained using the K-pop methodology) is unlike many of the genre’s other bands. The group comprises multiple ethnicities: Sophia is from the Philippines; Yoonchae was born in South Korea; Manon was raised in Switzerland to Swiss-Italian and Ghanian parents; Daniela is Venezuelan-Cuban and Lara is of Indian descent, though both were born and raised in the US; and Megan is from Hawaii, born to a Singaporean-Chinese mother and Swedish-American father. Their songs are also sung almost entirely in English.\n \n\n   \n  Since Katseye’s official debut in 2024 with the EP “SIS (Soft is Strong)” and the viral breakthrough single “Touch,” which quickly landed on Spotify’s Top Hits playlist, the group has grown into one of pop’s most watched newcomers, adored for its diverse appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Leon shares a similarly multicultural upbringing. He currently resides in Eagle Rock, the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood where he was born and raised by a Peruvian father and Chinese mother, to whom he attributes his love of fashion. “My mom worked in a cafeteria by day, but in the evening, she would work on all these fun things, like selling cowboy hats to people, or in the ’80s she would sell fur coats at home, almost like the way people sell Tupperware,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She always encouraged me to be yourself and to clash, to not need things to be so perfect,” Leon added. “I took to heart a lot of that.”\n \n\n   \n  After working as a visual merchandiser for Gap and Burberry early in his career, Leon made his name in New York in the 2000s — he co-founded the now-shuttered Opening Ceremony (a once-cult shopping destination with stores in New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo) and was formerly co-designer at Kenzo, a role he jointly held with Carol Lim, with whom he revitalized the label by injecting a youthful, streetwise sensibility that appealed to shoppers.\n \n\n   \n  “Opening Ceremony was the antithesis of everything I had ever done,” said Leon. “It was about celebrating young designers and going around the world and finding these gems and bringing them to one place and creating almost this town square where people can discover stuff. Some people would buy, some didn’t — but for us, it didn’t matter. It was about creating a community where people can come together.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon is among a wave of fashion insiders who in recent years have made the shift to music and entertainment. Cynthia Oh, for instance, worked in high-end retail for more than two decades before becoming the visual creative director at Hybe and, now, The Black Label — K-pop super-producer Teddy Park’s company, which represents Blackpink’s Rosé among others.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve always celebrated this idea of bringing culture together,” Leon continued. “And so, in many ways, Katseye is just a different version of that.”\n \n\n   \n    A new kind of girl power\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s return to Eagle Rock and subsequent decision to launch the Peruvian-Chinese restaurant Chifa, in 2022, was spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. But it also led to his music industry crossover. “One day, this great punk rock girl group called  The Linda Lindas  came in. I was really inspired by them and said, ‘I would love to make a music video for you. Let’s do something fun.’” So, Leon worked with the band to create music videos for its 2022 album, “Growing Up,” which subsequently caught the eye of Hybe chairman Bang Si-hyuk and Interscope Geffen A&M chairman and CEO John Janick.\n \n\n   \n  “They approached me and asked if I would be interested in working on a global girl group,” said Leon. “The one thing I realized in all my other ventures I had done before is that there was this connection to storytelling and authenticity. When I was able to sum this up for myself, I felt like I could bring that same energy to other things,” he said. “The restaurant was the first thing that I started outside of fashion — yet a lot of people tell me it has a similar vibe to Opening Ceremony. It made me realize I was doing the right thing, and that I could bring this feeling to other cultures and artistic work.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s first interactions with Katseye involved “really getting to know them.” There have been “countless” girl groups, he said, rattling off a list of acts preceding them, such as the Spice Girls and Destiny’s Child, so it was crucial to figure out “the ideologies and virtues that these girls bring” and what made them   different. “The first thing I said to them was, ‘I want to hear about your background, how you grew up. I know you can dance, you can sing, but let’s hear about what you truly love and are inspired by,’ and with that, we were able to create a story that was genuine,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We talk a lot about silhouettes, we talk about designers, but it goes beyond that. We make sure that their culture is around and that each girl, as a whole, is represented,” Leon continued, noting the bindi worn by Lara as an example. (The bindi — a decorative mark or sticker worn on the forehead, most commonly by women in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions — is often sported by Lara, who has not disclosed her religion but has spoken publicly about using it to reclaim and represent   the   South Asian identity she was teased for as a child.)\n \n\n   \n  That emphasis on representation also extends to Katseye’s music. The band’s latest EP, “Beautiful Chaos,” released in June, marks a bolder chapter, with tracks like “Gnarly” and “M.I.A” highlighting each member’s vocal range and increasingly defined personal identities. “Gabriela,” the second single in the EP, is “very different to most of the other songs in that it has a femininity to it,” explained Leon. “Daniela sings the Spanish part of the song. It has this Latin vibe that we wanted to make sure that we capture.” What remains crucial, across both their songs and style, is “that there is synergy amongst each other,” Leon said.\n \n\n   \n  As Katseye’s tour begins, just weeks after the band’s first Grammy nomination, Leon is remaining tightlipped about his stage outfits. “We like to keep things as a surprise,” he teased, but noted that maintaining a sense of relatability and individuality have remained top priorities.\n \n\n   \n  For Leon, Katseye is the living embodiment of girl power for a Gen Z audience that is   “hungry for authenticity and genuine brands that stand for something, or a voice that they can relate to,” he said. But the group, Leon hopes, isn’t just for young girls, but fans of all genders and ages. “I want people to see themselves in Katseye,” he said. “I want them to be excited that a group like Katseye exists.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/science/hitler-dna-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-05:00","title":"Researchers say they verified and sequenced Hitler’s DNA.

What they discovered is a controversial bombshell \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:52 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Researchers have analyzed a sample of DNA believed to belong to Adolf Hitler, which they say reveals the dictator of Nazi Germany had a genetic marker for a rare disorder that can delay puberty, according to a new documentary.\n \n\n   \n  The research, which took more than four years to complete, was led by geneticist Turi King, a professor at the UK’s University of Bath who is known for identifying the  remains of King Richard III . King said she verified that a piece of material taken from a couch in the bunker where Hitler shot himself in 1945 was soaked in the dictator’s blood by comparing a DNA sample recovered from the blood with a confirmed relative of Hitler’s.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to suggesting the possibility that Hitler had a hormone-disrupting congenital condition called  Kallmann syndrome , the documentary examined rumors that the dictator had Jewish ancestry and looked at whether he had a genetic predisposition to certain mental health conditions. Called “Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,” the documentary premieres Saturday on Channel 4 in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  However, the findings shared in the documentary haven’t been reviewed by other scientists in the field or published in a scientific journal, making it hard for experts not involved in the project to evaluate the validity of its assertions. King said that the analysis had been submitted to a “high-profile” journal and said she hopes the work will be published soon.\n \n\n   \n  The small patch of frayed fabric started its journey in 1945 in the hands of US Army Col. Roswell P. Rosengren, who was communications officer for Gen. Dwight D Eisenhower. When Rosengren was allowed into Hitler’s bunker by Soviet forces, he cut a swatch of material from a bloodstained couch, according to the documentary. The swatch stayed in Rosengren’s family before being put up for sale at auction in 2014 and purchased by the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t know what we were going to find,” King said. “It could have been the most boring genome on the planet, but it has been incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The most striking finding from the team’s analysis was that Hitler had a mutation on a gene called PROK2. Variants in this gene  are a cause of Kallmann syndrome  and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, King  said. In boys, these conditions   can delay puberty and cause undescended testicles.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, they are characterized by low testosterone levels. You either don’t go through puberty or you go through a partial puberty … 5% of cases get associated with a  micropenis , ”    King said, referring to a small but normally structured penis.\n \n\n   \n    Clues in the historical record\n \n\n   \n  At the time of his death, Hitler was observed at the end of the sofa with a gun and blood splattered on the couch and the wall behind him, said Nicholas F. Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist with the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History. He examined parts of the sofa, which is now in Russia, in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  “If the provenance of the sofa material used is confirmed to have come from the Bunker and from the settee that Hitler and  Eva Braun  died on, then the likelihood of the blood having come from Hitler is very good,” Bellantoni said by email.\n \n\n   \n  The new details that King put forth appear to align with the historical record, according to Alex Kay, an expert on Nazi Germany and senior lecturer at the Chair of War Studies at Germany’s University of Potsdam. Kay also appeared in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that a medical document from Hitler’s stay in prison after a failed coup known as the Munich  beer hall putsch  in 1923 suggested the dictator had right-side cryptorchidism — a condition in which a testicle fails to descend into the scrotum.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of Kallmann syndrome is, for me, personally, as a historian and as somebody who has spent more than 20 years researching the Nazis, a major finding,” Kay said. He added the information potentially explained Hitler’s lack of personal relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Kay and King said the findings also put to rest lingering rumors that Hitler had Jewish ancestry — speculation that stemmed from Hitler’s grandmother becoming pregnant while working in a Jewish household, according to the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Because the Y chromosome data analyzed in the research matched the DNA of Hitler’s male line relative, King said it’s not possible Hitler had Jewish ancestry. “If that was the case, we wouldn’t have got the DNA match with him,” King said. “That DNA match not only confirmed that this is Hitler’s DNA but also confirms that that story of human Jewish ancestry through his father is just simply not true.”\n \n\n   \n    The value of historical DNA\n \n\n   \n  King said she had some initial reservations about taking part in the documentary but decided to participate because she felt her expertise would   ensure that the analysis was scientifically rigorous. “This is also not just a documentary but an academic paper,” she said, adding she had no publication date to offer.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have previously used DNA to study well-known historical figures. Beethoven’s DNA, recovered from a lock of hair, revealed that the  composer had health issues . Archaeologists also widely use ancient DNA from human remains.\n \n\n   \n  However, without information on the quality of the genome, the raw data or how the analyses were done, it is not possible to assess the assertions made in the documentary, according to Pontus Skoglund, senior group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n \n\n   \n  “Stepping back, the scientific value of a media campaign such as this balanced against the possible stigmatization of individuals with these real diseases today can also be questioned,” Skoglund said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the researchers could have shared the findings with the scientific community on what’s known as a preprint server before a formal peer review and publication in an established journal.\n \n\n   \n  It’s plausible that historical DNA could be extracted from the piece of cloth, but there has to be good justification for studying the DNA from historical figures and a defined set of questions, said Tom Booth, Skoglund’s colleague and a bioarchaeologist at the Francis Crick Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “There are extensive historical records documenting the behaviour of Hitler in public and private,” Booth said via email. “(H)e is probably one of the most intensively studied figures in history, so I think it’s difficult to argue the DNA evidence adds much in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  “Even the Kallmann syndrome diagnosis might not be as straightforward as the headlines suggest. There can be a lot of variation in how it manifests physically, and while it is a plausible explanation for his undescended testicle, it doesn’t justify the amount of ‘micropenis’ in my newsfeed.” \n \n\n   \n    A ‘small, small puzzle piece’\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also said they calculated a polygenic risk score, which involves sifting through a person’s DNA to quantify disease risk. Their findings suggested that Hitler had an increased genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.\n \n\n   \n  However, polygenic risk score is a tool used today for research purposes — it’s not diagnostic and doesn’t mean that Hitler necessarily had these conditions, said Ditte Demontis, a professor in psychiatric genetics at Denmark’s Aarhus University, who was involved in the research and appears in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  “Currently, we are at a state where polygenic risk scores for psychiatric conditions are only used in the context of research,” Demontis emphasized. “We can say something at a group level but not an individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Demontis compared Hitler’s polygenic risk score with those of 30,000 Danish people and found that if Hitler lived today “his score for schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder was actually higher than 99% of the individuals in the Danish population.” It is also rare to have a high polygenic risk score for all three conditions, she added.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not diagnostic, and I also want to stress that the score absolutely by no means leads to any certain kinds of behavior or actions,” Demontis said.\n \n\n   \n  King agreed. “We are at great, great pain not to stigmatize people with these conditions, because, you know … it’s incredibly rare that   people with these conditions go on to commit violent acts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And the other thing is that Hitler did not act alone, he had hundreds and thousands of people who helped him,” King noted. “They’re not all going to have the same genetic makeup as him. His genetics is just a small, small puzzle piece.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/cost-of-living-affordability-plan-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:51:00-05:00","title":"The affordability crisis is forcing Trump to radically reshape his economic plan on the fly","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is revising his economic strategy in response to a growing affordability crisis, declining public approval, and political setbacks.

But the realities of a persistent  affordability crisis , low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly.\n \n\n   \n  Although still in the early stages, Trump’s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items.\n \n\n   \n  Each tactic comes with significant question marks – and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans’ finances even more.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan A\n \n\n   \n  The original Trump economic plan was based on  three bold assumptions :\n \n\n   \n  For the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That’s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over.\n \n\n   \n  As it turns out, some parts didn’t work.\n \n\n   \n  Boosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven’t fallen – they’ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  High-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Bond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans has  doubled over the past four years , according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  It may be early to judge Trump’s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recent  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month’s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters’ minds when they went the polls.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan B\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new plan is emerging.\n \n\n   \n   Tariff dividends:  Trump last weekend floated the idea of  $2,000 tariff rebate checks , a proposal he’s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered.\n \n\n   \n  Using tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more,  exacerbating inflation .\n \n\n   \n   50-year mortgages:  Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a  50-year mortgage , which could lower homebuyers’ monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  But critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowers  never actually own their homes . Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump.\n \n\n   \n  All of that could harm Americans’ long-term financial security.\n \n\n   \n   Portable mortgages:  Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering a  portable mortgage , which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move – even as current mortgage rates remain high.\n \n\n   \n  But industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way.\n \n\n   \n   Lowering some tariffs:  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announce  lower tariffs on produce  that isn’t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n  That could reduce import prices, but it probably won’t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans’ fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won’t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures.\n \n\n   \n    Make America Affordable Again\n \n\n   \n  A significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump’s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the administration’s policies may be exacerbating the so-called  K-shaped economy , in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasingly  live paycheck to paycheck. \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s immediate reaction to the GOP’s election losses and new polls was denialism: He  claimed, falsely , that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN’s Alayna Treene  that Trump is getting more frequent economic briefings  and has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies.\n \n\n   \n  And Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: “Make America Affordable Again.” The devil, as always, will be in the details.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/walmart-ceo-doug-mcmillon-retire","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:53:00-05:00","title":"Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is stepping down","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug McMillon, who served as Walmart’s CEO for over a decade, is stepping down, with John Furner set to take over as U.S. CEO on February 1, 2026.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO for just over a decade, is retiring next year, the retailer announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon will be succeeded by John Furner on February 1, 2026. Furner is currently the CEO and president of Walmart’s US operations, the company’s largest business unit. Both executives have been with the company for several decades in various leadership roles.\n \n\n   \n  The transition comes amid a tumultuous time for retailers, as  tariffs  and sinking consumer sentiment has roiled the industry’s bottom lines. Yet  Walmart  under McMillon has overcome many of the issues that have plagued competitors – its supply-chain dominance and grocery prowess has allowed Walmart to offer rock-bottom prices on necessities, attracting customers across a wide range of income groups. The company reported in its most recent earnings call that its fastest-growing customer segment includes households who earn  more than $100,000 a year .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also oversaw the company’s transition to a major ecommerce competitor, offering a strong alternative to Amazon and a significant growth engine for Walmart. The company has grown its Walmart+ subscription business that serves as a kind of nascent rival to Amazon Prime.\n \n\n   \n  He was also previously the  chairman  of Business Roundtable, the most prominent group of nearly 200 chief executives representing corporate America’s interests in Washington, for a two-year term.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to expanding Walmart, he’s also made striking changes at the company. In 2019, Walmart stopped selling handgun ammunition, ammunition commonly used in military-style assault weapons and ask customers to stop openly carrying guns at stores after a mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas location left  22 people dead .\n \n\n   \n  He was also an  outspoken  critic of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, and he has frequently spoken out against President Donald Trump’s  tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  But McMillon also oversaw the unsuccessful $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, an upmarket Amazon rival that didn’t pan out the way Walmart had expected. The business was ultimately shut down and integrated into the broader Walmart.com. McMillon’s push into upscale clothing, like Bonobos, also  hasn’t worked out .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon first began as a store associate and worked his way to top including stints at Sam’s Club and Walmart’s international operations. He helped harness Walmart ( WMT ) into being a true competitor to Amazon and its stock has grown 300% since he became CEO in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family and Board have stated many times that Doug was uniquely qualified to be CEO at the necessary time for Walmart,” said Greg Penner, Chairman of Walmart Inc., in a press release. “Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Furner, he’s been the CEO and President of Walmart US’ 4,600 stores since 2019 and also began as an hourly associate in 1993. In addition, he’s worked at Sam’s Club and Walmart China. The company credited his “associate development, digital innovation, and operational excellence.”\n \n\n   \n  Walmart said that McMillon remain on its board until next June and will be an adviser to Furner throughout fiscal year 2027.

Catherine Nicholls, Christian Edwards, Billy Stockwell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:53 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC apologized to US President Donald Trump on Thursday over a documentary that Trump’s lawyers described as false and defamatory, seeking to defuse a row that has plunged the public broadcaster into its  worst crisis in years .\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson said that lawyers for the broadcaster had written to Trump’s legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President (Donald) Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any BBC platforms while rejecting that it was defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s arguments as to why it believes it does not have a case to answer, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip not meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the October 2024 documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday. He is yet to respond to the BBC apology.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC had already apologized for an error of judgment in the documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, but not before it had ignited a scandal that saw the resignations of its director-general and head of news.\n \n\n   \n  In the documentary, Trump’s January 6 speech was edited to show him saying: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the US leader said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” with “fight like hell” coming 54 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Trump said the British broadcaster had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday,  the Telegraph newspaper  accused the BBC of similarly editing the same speech in a 2022 episode of the show Newsnight, again making it look like Trump was encouraging his followers to “fight like hell” in the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the broadcaster said that “the BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards,” adding that the matter “has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s board has been criticized for responding too slowly to the editing error, which was revealed in a leaked internal memo that has created a firestorm of criticism and allegations of systemic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Deborah Turness, the outgoing CEO of BBC News who resigned on Sunday, has said that while mistakes were made, “allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to BBC News staff following her resignation, Turness said that the backlash surrounding the Trump documentary had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC that the broadcaster was “right to apologize for what were serious mistakes.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked if she believed the BBC is “doomed” if it loses the public’s trust, the official said that the organization “is and remains the most trusted source of news in this country, and one of the top five most trusted sources of news all over the world.”\n \n\n   \n  When it makes mistakes, the BBC must be “willing and able to respond to that level of challenge and to put in place changes, because that trust is something that is essential, it’s vital, it’s precious, and it must be protected,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The British public broadcaster’s next steps are not immediately clear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment when reached by CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/republicans-scramble-health-care-obamacare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Republicans scramble for health care plan, as Democrats eye midterm battle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the enhanced subsidies of the Affordable Care Act expire in weeks, Republicans are under intense pressure to develop a new health care plan that avoids extending subsidies, which they view as funding a failed Obamacare model.

for health care plan, as Democrats eye midterm battle \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans in Washington successfully  defused the 43-day government shutdown  without surrendering to Democrats’ demands to spend billions more to offset spiking health insurance costs.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the GOP is under mounting pressure to figure out its own plan.\n \n\n   \n  Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire in just weeks – which would  more than double  the cost of premiums nationally for tens of millions of Americans. And it’s causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the White House, officials are accelerating efforts to put together a new health care plan that fulfills  President Donald Trump ’s desire to take another shot at overhauling Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  Those early discussions have sought to balance Trump’s demands against the broader Republican Party’s wariness of waging another politically disastrous health care war, four people familiar with the matter said. Officials are debating a limited package of conservative health care changes, including eliminating the enhanced ACA subsidies in favor of funneling money directly to Americans — potentially through an expansion of health savings accounts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, are closely watching the GOP’s plans, which they believe will never pass Congress – giving them a huge political boost and possibly delivering them control of the House in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of the GOP’s plans is fueling anxiety for Republicans like Rep. Jeff Van Drew, the outspoken populist from New Jersey who has repeatedly urged party leaders to give some relief for those Obamacare premiums or face voters’ wrath next November.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a whole bunch [of ideas] that are out there,” Van Drew said, ticking off proposals such as Trump’s idea to give money directly to consumers to buy plans. “The question is, can we get them done on time, to really not hurt people in the United States of America?”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another reason Van Drew is worrying. Time is running short and he said GOP leaders have been tight-lipped on their plans: “A lot of members haven’t seen any of this.”\n \n\n   \n  He isn’t the only one sounding the alarm. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — who has drawn the ire of Trump himself for her criticism of the party — has been repeatedly warning of a health care catastrophe of the GOP’s own making if Congress doesn’t act.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s my problem. Republicans have never fixed it,” Greene said of Obamacare in an interview with “The Sean Spicer Show.” She said Republicans need to act to make sure “the American people aren’t driving 80 miles per hour off a brick wall and hitting a financial crisis which is what’s actually happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the GOP’s leadership ranks,  there’s an acknowledgement  they need to do something on health care affordability. But those party leaders are also staunchly opposed to renewing those subsidies, which they insist simply funds insurance companies and props up a failed law.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, House GOP leaders are assembling their own slate of health care bills — though exactly which ones have yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pulling together the best ideas that we can, in the quickest fashion, to bring premiums down,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Wednesday night, the same day the House returned from a six-week recess during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  White House aides have similarly indicated that they will soon have a concrete plan, insisting that the administration plans to play a central role in directing the GOP’s health care strategy amid deepening concerns over Trump’s standing on the economy and affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to further expanding health savings accounts, officials have weighed a range of existing conservative policy ideas aimed at expanding patients’ health care options and lowering costs — including loosening certain Obamacare guardrails and giving states greater flexibility to customize their health insurance marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Yet many of those proposals have proven unpopular with voters in the past, and fall well short of Trump’s vow to “forget this Obamacare madness” altogether. And as the midterm outlook worsens for the GOP, some in the party still plan to push for a simpler compromise on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  There are at least a dozen House Republicans who do support temporarily extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies, many of them from battleground districts that will be key to GOP control of the chamber next year. Virginia Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans has been particularly vocal on the issue, drafting a bill to extend the subsidies for one year that’s gotten a dozen GOP cosponsors.\n \n\n   \n  Kiggans and her cosponsors are already working to plot a path forward: Staff of several of those members on the bill will meet Thursday to discuss next steps, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Another swing-seat Republican backing the bill, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Senate leaders Thursday seeking bipartisan talks to work on a bill extending those Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But even some House moderates privately acknowledge that it’s unlikely any provision that upholds Obamacare can pass the GOP chamber. Even if the bill would win Democratic votes, GOP leaders know there is fierce resistance to any Obamacare bill and would refuse to put it on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also grown increasingly opposed to continuing the subsidies despite the political peril, with one of the people familiar with the matter characterizing the president as “on fire” over the issue. Though administration officials during the shutdown’s first weeks had weighed supporting a short-term extension that would phase out the subsidies over time, that idea has since appeared to lose steam, the people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump in recent days has instead repeatedly disparaged the tax credits as a “disaster” and latched onto arguments made by conservative allies that they largely amount to a windfall for insurance companies.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jim Jordan, the influential House Judiciary chairman, for instance, entirely dismissed the idea of extending the subsidies when pressed by CNN if he could accept any plan that kept them in place.\n \n\n   \n  “If Obamacare was so wonderful, why do we need to keep extending the expanded subsidies?” the Ohio Republican said. ”This is an expansion of Obamacare.”\n \n\n   \n  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, too, argued that any extension of the subsidies would be simply a move to “prop up a failed Obamacare fund.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Affordable Care Act has failed miserably at being affordable. That is a broken model. We want to give people options that lower their premiums, not just shovel more money to insurance companies,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-decision-nears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Clock is ticking ahead of NCAA’s decision on proposed gambling rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA is facing mounting pressure to decide on a proposed rule allowing college athletes and staff to bet on professional sports, with a deadline of November 21, 2025, to gather support from at least two-thirds of Division I schools.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.\n \n\n   \n  But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense.\n \n\n   \n  Betting on college sports will remain a no-no.\n \n\n   \n  “This change recognizes the realities of today’s sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,’’ Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement.\n \n\n   \n  The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach.\n \n\n   \n  The timing created immediate blowback at the NCAA’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey wrote to NCAA president Charlie Baker, urging him to reconsider.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association’s commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,’’ Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process.\n \n\n   \n  It is worth noting that, of the 20 cabinet members who voted, and despite their commissioner’s protests, the two representing the SEC - Jeremiah Donati, the athletic director at South Carolina, and Matt Boyer, the SEC’s assistant commissioner for compliance - both voted in favor of the proposal per the NCAA committee’s report.\n \n\n   \n  Of the eight people representing the four power conferences (each of whose votes is weighted: 2.75 versus 1), both ACC representatives voted against the initial proposal, the Big Ten and SEC voted in favor, and the Big 12 split its vote.\n \n\n   \n  In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General’s office  announced  14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/immigration-california-revokes-commercial-drivers-licenses-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:33:00-05:33","title":"California revokes 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses for immigrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California has revoked 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants after discovering that the licenses expired after the drivers’ legal status in the U.S. had ended.

The issue was thrust into the public’s consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the US made an illegal U-turn and caused a  crash in Florid a that killed three people.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California’s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver’s licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we’ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,” Duffy said, referring to the state’s governor. “This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person’s legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Newsom’s spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver’s licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed.\n \n\n   \n  The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy revoked $40 million in  federal funding  because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state’s effort to comply.\n \n\n   \n  The new rules for commercial driver’s licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa.\n \n\n   \n  H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a US business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n \n\n   \n  Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn’t have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver’s work permit expired — sometimes years after.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said the state followed guidance it received from the US Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/eric-swalwell-mortgage-investigation","dateOfPublication":"1212-06-01","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00.000-05:00","title":"Bill Pulte refers Rep.

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by January 30, 2026 in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2025 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/health/glp-1-hair-loss-telogen-effluvium-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Why some people lose their hair when they’re on GLP-1s","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing concern about hair loss as a side effect of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.\n \n\n   \n  “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”\n \n\n   \n  A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,   diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.\n \n\n   \n  The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.\n \n\n   \n    What is telogen effluvium?\n \n\n   \n  There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.\n \n\n   \n  “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”\n \n\n   \n  When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.\n \n\n   \n  Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.\n \n\n   \n    Malnutrition may play a role\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.\n \n\n   \n  Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”   \n \n\n   \n  Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”\n \n\n   \n    Other theories\n \n\n   \n  There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.\n \n\n   \n  Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”\n \n\n   \n  Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum points to a  study  in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.\n \n\n   \n  “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.\n \n\n   \n  “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”\n \n\n   \n  A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.\n \n\n   \n  “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”\n \n\n   \n    Treatments for hair loss\n \n\n   \n  Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”\n \n\n   \n  That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.\n \n\n   \n  “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth. In androgenetic alopecia, we’re looking at more long-term therapies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.\n \n\n   \n  “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”\n \n\n   \n  Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/oklahoma-gas-leak-ammonia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:16:00-05:00","title":"Ammonia Gas Leak from a Tanker Truck in Oklahoma Sickens Dozens and Forces Evacuations","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A dangerous ammonia gas leak occurred from a tanker truck parked behind a Holiday Inn Express in Weatherford, Oklahoma, resulting in the evacuation of hundreds of residents and dozens of people being treated for respiratory and skin injuries.

He said a police officer managed to save his coworker.\n \n\n   \n  “His lips were purple and frozen shut,” Johnson said. “His eyes were bloodshot red. His skin was all red.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson found one person stumbling and gave him a shirt to put over his mouth. At one point, he looked at the smoke and saw they were surrounded, thinking “We’re going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers.\n \n\n   \n  Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day.\n \n\n   \n  A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating.\n \n\n   \n  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago,  five people died  in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan.\n \n\n   \n  The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials.\n \n\n   \n  The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.”\n \n\n   \n  The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part. I know it’s your house, but you really have to go.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/entertainment/james-van-de-beek-auction","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:16:00-05:00","title":"James Van Der Beek Auctioning Off 'Dawson’s Creek' and 'Varsity Blues' Memorabilia Amid Life’s 'Twists and Turns'","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Van Der Beek is auctioning off iconic memorabilia from his roles in the 1998–2003 television series 'Dawson’s Creek' and the 1999 film 'Varsity Blues', including the prom necklace gifted to Joey, the pilot episode outfit, film-worn cleats, and a West Canaan Coyotes hat.

The attacks were part of a campaign the Trump administration says is aimed at disrupting the operations of drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  But in a meeting the lawmakers expected would center around growing concerns over whether the military had the legal right to kill traffickers without knowing their identities and without trial, the two Pentagon briefers had left something behind: the military lawyers who had been scheduled to attend.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of the sudden cancellation by the lawyers was immediately seen by some of the lawmakers as a classic stonewalling tactic – with no lawyers around, the Pentagon officials could claim ignorance on legal questions – triggering the wry laughs in the secure room.\n \n\n   \n  But what the Pentagon officials did have to say that day struck several attendees as deeply troubling. It was the way briefers described those killed in the operations – so-called enemy combatants – that seemed to provide evidence that the administration was dusting off the playbook of the drone war in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The briefers discussed the strikes against alleged drug boats in nearly identical terms as those carried out in the Middle East during the global war on terror: Killed in Action, target signature, enemy combatants.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, wait a minute, enemy KIA, what war are we talking about here? What declared conflict am I missing?” one source familiar with the briefing told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In that and other briefings with lawmakers, military officials have acknowledged they didn’t know the names of those killed, the exact destination of their vehicles or have the documentation to prosecute them for their alleged crimes. But the targets’ actions fit the intelligence of what the briefers referred to as “terrorist” activity and so they were labeled as “enemy KIA,” or killed in action, a phrase used for decades to represent troops perishing on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  The US spent more than a decade carrying out attacks, known as “signature strikes,” based on similar rough intelligence profiles as part of its drone campaign in the Middle East. But that campaign occurred during a period when US troops were routinely coming under enemy fire and were facing regular roadside bombings.\n \n\n   \n  US forces operating in and around Latin America have not reported taking fire, and the Pentagon has said no troops have been injured during its recent operations in the region. Nonetheless, the US military has conducted 20 strikes, destroying 21 boats while labeling those killed “narco-terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been explicit in drawing the comparison between terrorist groups and drug trafficking operations in Latin America, calling them the “Al-Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere.”\n \n\n   \n  “My advice to foreign terrorist organizations, do not get in a boat,” Hegseth said during a recent speech.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes against boats have used drones designed to carry hellfire missiles, the same combination of hardware that had been the backbone of the signature strike campaign in the Middle East, though CNN has reported that AC-130J gunships have also participated in some of the attacks in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  US officials have told Congress they do not need to identify individual targets before killing them – mirroring an argument made by past administrations to justify similar strikes against terror networks.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that a signature is misinterpreted or erroneous and an innocent party is attacked,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and a senior adviser with the CSIS Defense and Security Department.\n \n\n   \n  He described how signature strikes in the Middle East used traits of a target, and how that same logic could be applied to drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Caribbean, that means that if a vessel exhibits characteristics a, b, and c, then it is presumed to be running drugs,” he said, though he added, “It’s possible that the administration has more direct information and is not releasing that to avoid compromising sources and methods.”\n \n\n   \n  But unlike during the war on terror, the Trump administration lacks Congressional authorization for a sustained military campaign against alleged drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of an opinion produced by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers, a distinction with a very clear difference compared to terror groups that have been targeted in similar strikes.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Trump administration lawyers appear to be relying heavily on the President’s broad Article II authority – the section of the Constitution that outlines the role of the president including their command of the military.\n \n\n   \n  Taken together, the Trump administration is testing the bounds of its authority to wage war abroad – fueling concerns among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who continue to question the president’s legal justification for the strikes. It has also raised questions as to what lessons the administration and military may or may not have learned from the decadeslong conflict in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not reply to a request for comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  “How many briefings have I sat in at this point, where there’s some general or admiral sitting there and giving me vignettes about operations, and talking about the number of people they kill, enemy combatants they kill, their boats they blowing up, or tanks they’re blowing up, and how the mission was a success, and none of them could actually tell me what the strategy and endgame was and how they were going to measure success,” Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “And, so this is no different. I mean, they have learned nothing from our last 25 years, it seems,” Crow, who also served three tours in Iraq in Afghanistan and was an Army Ranger, added.\n \n\n   \n    Expansion of strikes\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s broader plan for the counter-drug campaign has not been articulated publicly, top officials have made clear that they intend to continue targeting smugglers using a similar playbook to the one used for killing terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  In practice, current and former US national security officials told CNN the two missions are not so different.\n \n\n   \n  “Network targeting is network targeting,” said one former US intelligence official with knowledge of the administration’s current strategy focused on dismantling drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, the “end state complicates things,” the former official added.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes against alleged drug boats started September 2, announced by President Donald Trump in a post on social media claiming that the boat was being operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. That first strike killed 11, Trump wrote, as he claimed that the gang was being directed by Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That was a theme in the early wave of strikes, as the Trump administration tried to tie Maduro to drug trafficking – namely fentanyl – while attacking boats near the Venezuelan coast in the Caribbean. It coincided with a massive buildup of military assets in the Caribbean, which now includes the Ford Carrier Strike Group and has raised questions about  whether the US intends to strike inside Venezuela  and potentially try to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  While those tensions continue to simmer, the boat strike campaign began to expand to the Pacific Ocean in late October, shifting focus from fentanyl to stopping the movement of cocaine. The announced targets also got less specific. Nearly all of the subsequent strikes including that first in the Pacific were against a “designated terrorist organization,” as announced by Hegseth, mirroring Global War on Terror framing of attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN also reported.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  But the shift to strikes in the Pacific has led to concerns from other countries in Latin America that the boat strike campaign signals a broadening that could only continue.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico has long been viewed by US officials as an epicenter of the drug trade, and Trump, himself, has repeatedly inquired about sending American troops across the southern border to target cartels based there.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s previous offers to send US forces into Mexico have been rebuffed, but the ongoing US military strikes have added a new wrinkle to the already delicate relationship between the two countries, as seen by an unexpected phone call on October 27.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Navy got a call from the Pentagon that day informing officials there may be a survivor in the Pacific Ocean from a US strike.\n \n\n   \n  The call — and the strike prompting it — surprised Mexico as US officials had provided no advance warning. While still in international waters, the incident happened near Mexico’s coast immediately raising concerns about the expansion of the US counter-narcotic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The two other known survivors from earlier strikes were briefly detained on a US Navy ship but ultimately repatriated to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia – amid questions about the legality of holding them, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  In Mexico City after the October 27 call, senior Mexican officials scheduled a meeting with the US ambassador to try to understand why Mexico, a close US partner working with the US on counter-drug operations already, was not aware of the strike and what to expect moving forward. A  readout of the meeting  described it as cordial and “aimed to strengthen bilateral coordination between Mexico and the Unted States on maritime matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Weeks later, the Mexican Navy has not located the survivor from that strike after having called off its formal search and the unnamed person is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Mexico has responded to Trump’s focus on the drug trade and framing of terrorist networks driving the trade by trying to placate the Trump administration with numbers— an effort begun well before the strikes commenced. In calls between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump, Sheinbaum has kept the US president updated on progress and metrics as it relates to crime. Trump administration officials said that the two leaders have developed a good relationship, despite Sheinbaum’s public opposition to the administration’s boat strikes, and continue to work together on multiple fronts.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that countries cooperatively working with the US on drug smuggling efforts should not be concerned about unilateral US strikes on smugglers from their nations.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to help us find these people and blow them up if that’s what it takes. They’re going to help us with it,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Working with allies\n \n\n   \n  While there are strengths to effectively conducting a counter-terrorism mission at the US border, namely using the full power of the US intelligence community and military to identify vulnerabilities within these various groups, multiple current and former officials told CNN there are also obvious pitfalls.\n \n\n   \n  Those include issues related to collateral damage and managing political outrage from countries that are increasingly concerned the US may violate their sovereignty by conducting lethal strikes within their borders.\n \n\n   \n  Those are similar challenges to what US officials grappled with during the global war on terror.\n \n\n   \n  The former US intelligence official compared the US-Mexico dynamic to that of dealing with Pakistan during that time. Initially, the US refrained from conducting unilateral operations inside Pakistan’s borders, spending years asking for permission before carrying out strikes against suspected terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan never said no, the former official said, and the US eventually moved into a phase of simply notifying the country rather than asking for permission before a strike.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Pakistan, however, the Mexican government has repeatedly said no to Trump when he has raised the prospect of deploying the US military inside the country to target drug groups.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US intelligence officials have insisted that they are collaborating with the Mexican government when it comes to countering the flow of drugs and that any military or covert action carried out across the border will not be done unilaterally.\n \n\n   \n  But that has done little to ease the concerns of Mexican officials who believe that decision, ultimately, lies solely with the President.\n \n\n   \n  While all of the strikes to date have been at sea targeting boats allegedly carrying drugs, lawyers in the Trump administration have been debating potential justifications to extend those strikes to land, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  One strategy they have debated would be to identify land targets the US believes to be associated with drug trafficking and justifying those strikes with a second legal opinion that declares the host country unable or unwilling to address an imminent threat to Americans, sources familiar with the administration’s thinking said. Another possibility is to add Mexican cartels to an existing, secret list of 24 cartels and criminal organizations that the administration argues are legitimate targets. There’s no indication that a decision to conduct land strikes has been made.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the ongoing strikes in international waters are straining relations between the US and allies.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s reporting, Columbia President Gustavo Petro announced that he had ordered the country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the US stops the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  It was the escalation of a public spat between Trump and Petro, who in Columbia leads a country that has been a critical partner in US efforts to combat drugs.\n \n\n   \n  That dispute reached a fever pitch when one of the two survivors of US strikes who is Colombian was repatriated.\n \n\n   \n  The man was subsequently released by Colombian authorities due to a lack of evidence that he was an alleged trafficker, according to Petro, who has continued to question the US strategy of shoot-first and ask questions later.\n \n\n   \n  “Colombia’s prosecutor’s office, independent of the government, cannot investigate without evidence. Thousands of people we captured on boats with the seized cocaine are tried in Colombia, but the method of killing them and not seizing the evidence does not allow for trials; at most, only bodies are collected, without really knowing what they were transporting,” Petro posted on social media.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/hyundai-georgia-raid-korean-workers-back-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:23:00+00:00","title":"Some Korean Workers Detained in Georgia Immigration Raid Have Returned to Their Jobs at Hyundai Site","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, a US immigration raid by ICE detained 475 South Korean nationals working at Hyundai’s electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, sparking outrage in South Korea due to the violation of worker visas and perceived diplomatic betrayal.

were detained and left the US following in an  immigration raid  at Hyundai’s electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia, some of those workers have returned to America to resume those jobs, their employer said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The September raid shut down work on a battery plant under construction at the sprawling site near Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group began producing electric vehicles last year.\n \n\n   \n   Most of the 475 workers detained  were South Korean nationals. US immigration officials said they entered the US with visas that had expired or with visa waivers that prohibited them from working.\n \n\n   \n  The battery plant’s operator, HL-GA Battery Co., said in a statement Thursday that construction has resumed with a mix of new and returning workers. The company thanked the US and South Korean governments, as well as Georgia officials, “for their collaboration in supporting a smooth and timely return.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain on track to start production in the first half of next year and continue to actively hire local positions to operate the facility,” the battery company’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  An HL-GA Battery spokesperson, Mary Beth Kennedy, confirmed to The Associated Press that some of the returning workers were among the South Korean nationals detained in September. Kennedy said she did not know how many.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 South Korean workers were detained in an immigration raid September 4 at the sprawling site where the Hyundai Motor Group produces electric vehicles near Savannah. The workers spent a week at a Georgia detention center before the South Korean government negotiated their release and flew them home.\n \n\n   \n  The roundup by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which released video showing some of the detained workers shackled in chains, sparked  outrage and feelings of betrayal  in South Korea, a key US ally that has pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in American investments.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia raid targeted one of the state’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where  Hyundai produces  electric vehicles at a $7.6 billion plant. The 475 people detained all worked at the battery plant, which will produce batteries to power Hyundai EVs. It is operated by HL-GA Battery, a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution.\n \n\n   \n  The South Korean nationals detained in Georgia were largely engineers and other highly skilled workers who came to the US temporarily to install equipment and perform other specialized work to get the battery plant up and running.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many of the formerly detained workers are coming back. Jongwon Lee, an attorney in metro Atlanta, said he has firsthand knowledge of two Korean nationals who plan to return after the US State Department confirmed that their B-1 business visitor visas were still valid.\n \n\n   \n  But Kihwan Kim, president of the Federation of Korean Associations for the Southeast US, said some of the workers snared in the raid are hesitant to return to the US.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t have to come to the United States to work after that kind of humiliation,” Kim said. “They can go to other countries.”\n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s government demanded improvements to the US visa system for skilled Korean workers.

What’s that mean for air travel? \n       \n  By Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  People flying home for Thanksgiving this month have their list of things to be thankful for: the turkey, football, time with family. This year, they can also   add  H.R. 5371   to the list.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the funding bill President Donald Trump signed into law on Wednesday to reopen the government,  ending  the longest government shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after  cuts mandated  by the Federal Aviation Administration led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings”  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But before they get to say grace with family, travelers are now praying Bastian’s assessment is right, even as many questions remain about how quickly air traffic controller staffing will stabilize and when Transportation Security Administration workers will   get paid.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what we know about the plans to get more planes back up in the skies – and the uncertainty that remains.\n \n\n   \n    When will airlines stop canceling flights?\n \n\n   \n  The morning after the federal government reopened, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was filled with travelers keeping the hectic pace typical of the world’s busiest airport. But a closer look revealed something new: a palpable sense of relief in travelers.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that it will get back to some kind of normalcy or just a little bit better before the holidays,” Metreia White said, before boarding a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Hartsfield-Jackson is one of 40 major airports where airlines are still under  orders  from the FAA to cut   6% of their flights, many on shorter   regional routes . Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the cancellations have been necessary for safety because of air traffic controller staffing shortages during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Fridays and Saturdays have seen the most staffing problems throughout this time, according to data viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers missed  two paychecks  since   the shutdown started on  October 1 , and some are taking second jobs to make ends meet or calling in sick in protest.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been data-based,” Duffy said, citing examples of airplane mishaps at a  news conference  at Chicago O’Hare International Airport. “We’ve seen heightened complaints by pilots of the communication they’re having with air traffic controllers.”\n \n\n   \n  But “staffing levels …  improved dramatically ” when it became clear that a funding deal was coming, Bastian said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think our   air traffic controllers are seeing an end to the shutdown, and feel more hopeful, and they are coming in,” Duffy said on Tuesday. The  Department of Transportation  stopped short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers started showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain frozen at 6% until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  Logistics can also impact flight schedules, according to Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in a  statement  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Canceling one flight has a domino effect. They’ve had to move different airplanes in untraditional ways,” Sununu added at a news conference on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the challenges, airlines expect to rally quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a  statement  Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Southwest  said  on Wednesday they’re “seeing real progress, and air travel appears to be returning to normal. Our operation remains strong, and Customers can continue to count on Southwest.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines leaders told  employees  in a letter Thursday that they are optimistic about minimizing cancellations in time for the holiday.\n \n\n   \n  “It may take a few days for fully normal controller operations to resume, and we may need to continue to reduce schedules to comply with the FAA’s emergency order requirements,” wrote CEO Robert Ison and Chief Operating Officer David Seymour. “But we have seen promising signs and are confident that because of our strategic planning and work to minimize customer impacts throughout this period, we will recover quickly and deliver a strong Thanksgiving operation.”\n \n\n   \n    When do air traffic controllers get paid?\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday her team finished up the administrative work necessary “ late last night ” so TSA employees could receive back pay for paychecks missed during the government shutdown as soon as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve already missed pay periods and recognizing that that’s a hardship on their families,” Noem  said . “So we did all of the administrative work that we needed to late last night to ensure that payroll would be processed as soon as possible, and within the next coming days, they will get that into their bank accounts.”\n \n\n   \n  A DHS spokesperson told CNN the agency “will be working to expedite pay for all employees who were furloughed or working without pay in an excepted status.”\n \n\n   \n  Noem also announced some TSA employees who “stepped up every single day” and “served with exemplary service” through the federal government shutdown would receive a  $10,000 bonus check .\n \n\n   \n  “They were all examples of what we need and we will be continuing to not only recognize employees across the country, but we will be looking at every single TSA official that helped serve during this government shutdown and do what we can to recognize that and help them financially with a bonus check to get them and their family back on their feet,” the secretary said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Duffy  said  that air traffic controllers were expected to get 70% of their back pay “anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens,” with the remainder to come a week later.\n \n\n   \n  Technicians who work on air traffic control equipment are also awaiting their back pay, said David Spero, national president of their union, PASS National.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is going to take time,” said Spero. “We’re going to have people with ongoing pay issues for a while.”\n \n\n   \n  He also said the technicians who continued to maintain air traffic control equipment through the shutdown deserve recognition, too.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m looking into it and reaching out to FAA leadership now,” Spero said Thursday. “Not one delay in the last 43 days has been attributed to a system outage or an equipment problem.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the long-term impacts on travel?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have acknowledged losing millions of dollars of revenue from the canceled flights, and industry leaders said travelers were getting wary of putting money down on a trip that might not happen.\n \n\n   \n  “The consumer is pulling back,” said Sununu. “Typically, airlines and hotels can be a leading indicator of where folks are spending their money in the economy.”\n \n\n   \n  US  domestic flights  are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site  Going.com , but it’s not clear how those prices were affected by the flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  One bit of ironic luck for both airlines and passengers in the midst of this misfortune, according to the Delta CEO, is that all major carriers were   equally impacted, so the financial loss shouldn’t result in higher ticket prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a competitive marketplace,” said Bastian. “Everyone went through the same thing.”\n \n\n   \n  The airline industry says in the future, the government should guarantee the stability of the air travel system, even in a shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA’s  Airport and Airway Trust Fund  currently has $5 billion that could be used to pay air traffic controllers during future shutdowns,” Airlines for America said in a  statement . “We ask Congress to consider legislation that would implement a long-term solution.”\n \n\n   \n  There are other impacts too, that won’t be solved by the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit,  Duffy told reporters this week , while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n    Could this happen again in January?\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through  January .\n \n\n   \n  That means that airlines and passengers may be grounded again in three months.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does is kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, said it takes time to rebuild – both operations and morale – after disruptions like this to the travel industry.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot afford another self-inflicted crisis that threatens the systems millions rely on every day,” said Freeman.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Pete Muntean, Tami Luhby, Chris Boyette and Amanda Musa contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/lamonica-mciver-charges-new-jersey-immigration-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-05:00","title":"Judge Denies Rep.

LaMonica McIver, who was  charged with assaulting federal agents  during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her  May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center  in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  The case is a high-profile clash between Trump’s second administration and a Democratic lawmaker who has been sharply critical of the president’s policies. McIver  has pleaded not guilty  and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  The acting US attorney in New Jersey,  Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision is pending.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident.\n \n\n   \n  A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a  2019 appropriations bill  spelling out that authority.\n \n\n   \n  McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/middleeast/west-bank-mosque-graffiti-settlers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:48:00-11:48","title":"Israeli settlers torch mosque and spray graffiti in latest West Bank attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli settlers torched the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit, West Bank, and sprayed it with racist graffiti, including the phrase 'Mohammed is a pig,' during a pre-prayer attack.

While the 1954 Brown ruling outlawed school segregation, current decisions—such as the 2023 Students for Fair Admissions v.

Critics, including Sherrilyn Ifill and Jon Greenbaum, argue that this approach ignores the legacy of structural racism and undermines the practical need for race-based remedies to achieve equity. The article highlights key figures like Justice Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who offer contrasting views on Brown’s significance: Thomas sees it as a moral turning point, while Jackson emphasizes its relevance to ongoing struggles for equity. The Louisiana redistricting case and the ongoing debate over private enforcement of the Voting Rights Act further illustrate how the court’s decisions are eroding foundational civil rights protections.

Board, race and ‘equal protection’ through the eyes of the modern Supreme Court \n       \n  By Joan Biskupic, CNN Chief Supreme Court Analyst\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Supreme Court heard arguments in a racially charged  Louisiana voting rights case  last month, down on its ground floor a special exhibit was running a continual loop of commentary from Chief Justice John Roberts and others extolling the desegregation ruling of Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit takes advantage of the  restored bench  used by US district court Judge Ronald Davies, who ordered the enrollment of nine Black students at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Three years after the Brown ruling, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus was still fighting school integration.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s  Cooper v. Aaron  decision, arising from that Arkansas standoff, declared the state bound by Brown and reinforced the mandate of desegregation.\n \n\n   \n  The tone of the justices’ commentary in a video is lofty, such as from Justice Brett Kavanaugh: “Brown v. Board of Education is the single greatest moment, single greatest decision, in this court’s history. And the reason for that is that it enforced a constitutional principle, ‘equal protection of the laws,’ ‘equal justice under law,’ and made that real for all Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the concept of “equal protection of the laws” has shrunk with the modern Supreme Court. That has been evident in the justices’ rulings on race-based measures in education. And  during oral arguments  in the Louisiana case, Kavanaugh was among the justices who suggested the era of racial remedies, in education and voting, must end.\n \n\n   \n  As race endures as a flashpoint for the justices, the court has weakened the spirit and reach of Brown. A series of impending cases may further erode civil rights milestones.\n \n\n   \n  “Brown is a shell now,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, former president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the organization that took the lead in Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  “They will never reverse it,” she said of the justices. “They will just hollow it out. It’s a much more cynical project than rejecting it outright. … It is still incumbent upon this court to reconcile the decisions they’re making today with the truth of that decision.”\n \n\n   \n   Brown’s legacy , say civil rights advocates, permits race to be used in remedial policies to ensure equal opportunity and to enhance diversity. They contend Brown never required governments to be blind to race, especially as prejudice and discrimination endure.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative majority that controls today’s court has been advancing a “colorblind” ideal and rejecting the kind of race-conscious remedies upheld for decades to address historic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts, Kavanaugh and others on the right-wing envision a country now in an era of racial neutrality, or as the  chief justice famously wrote in 2007 , “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  New cases are on the horizon as activists continue to take advantage of the court’s trend. The group that challenged Harvard and won a 2023 decision striking down race-based college admissions has filed a series of new lawsuits in lower courts, including one challenging the practice of Kamehameha Schools in Hawaii of giving a preference to applicants of Native Hawaiian ancestry.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the pending Louisiana dispute that began with a NAACP Legal Defense Fund claim of vote dilution in redistricting, the justices are scheduled this month to consider appeals that would test whether advocacy groups and other private parties can even bring such Voting Rights Act claims.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  accelerated  a separate line of litigation with its effort to end what’s known as “disparate impact” liability. Such lawsuits have traditionally been brought when an employer imposes a seemingly neutral policy that disproportionately hurts Blacks and other groups protected by civil rights law.\n \n\n   \n  A gap exists between the court’s declarations of equality and the country’s reality, especially considering the Trump administration’s diminishment of civil rights laws that date to the 1960s and its desire to end diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “The justices have been equating equal protection to colorblindness, and in doing that they are ignoring a history of structural racism and the continuing effects that give Black people and other people of color less opportunity,” said Jon Greenbaum, who for more than a decade was chief counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and last year founded Justice Legal Strategies.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going through a period of time where we need greater protection from the court rather than reduced protection,” said Greenbaum, the co-counsel in lawsuits arising from President Donald Trump’s removal of certain officials from independent agencies, such as the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n \n\n   \n    Division over what Brown means\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s reinterpretation of the 1954 Brown v. Board landmark was underway long before Trump first came to office. With Chief Justice Roberts at the lead, the court has ruled against school integration plans and  race-based admissions .\n \n\n   \n  The nine justices came together to offer video commentary for their Brown v. Board of Education exhibit tucked in an alcove behind the oversized sculpture of Chief Justice John Marshall. But they are themselves riven over what Brown means.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2023  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard  decision ending university race-based admissions, Roberts wrote for a six-justice majority that Brown stands for the principle that “eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” even measures that help traditionally excluded Black and Hispanic students.\n \n\n   \n  The three liberal dissenters countered, “Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. … In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts’ limited view of Brown was first on full display in the 2007 dispute over school-integration plans. He relied on the landmark as he invalidated efforts to diversify public schools in Seattle and Louisville.\n \n\n   \n  “Before  Brown , schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,” Roberts wrote. “The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again—even for very different reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted Justice John Paul Stevens to declare in dissent, “There is a cruel irony in The Chief Justice’s reliance on our decision in  Brown  v.  Board of Education.  … The Chief Justice fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools. In this and other ways, The Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court’s most important decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to reject the Seattle and Kentucky school-integration plans in that 2007 controversy, separated himself from the Roberts’ view of Brown and his “all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor” to ensure equal opportunity in schools.\n \n\n   \n  Wrote Kennedy, who retired in 2018, succeeded by Kavanaugh: “The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion.”\n \n\n   \n    Voting Rights Act\n \n\n   \n  The Louisiana redistricting case heard in October arises as the court has been erasing the protections of another milestone of the country’s civil rights era: The 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the arguments, the conservative majority may further restrict remedies for maps that dilute the electoral power of Blacks and Hispanics, particularly in the South.\n \n\n   \n  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act only after the March 7, 1965, “Bloody Sunday” attack on civil rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama. State troopers and other police assaulted the marchers with tear gas, clubs and whips.\n \n\n   \n  The pending VRA case traces to 2022, when Louisiana legislators drew a congressional-district map in which Blacks had the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the six districts, despite the fact that Blacks make up about a third of the population in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A lower US district court ruled that the map diluted Blacks’ electoral power and likely violated the Voting Rights Act; it ordered the state to redraw the map with two Black-majority districts. After the new map was crafted with two districts, White voters sued. The question for the justices is whether that second district unconstitutionally divided people by race.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a new question in a pair of appeals to be reviewed in the justices’ private conference on November 21 turns on whether only the US Justice Department – not private groups – can sue under the VRA to challenge redistricting that dilutes the power of minority voters. The  8th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a case  brought by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippawa Indians that that the VRA lacks a provision for such private lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  If the high court were to adopt that approach, few suits to vindicate voting rights would likely be brought. The Justice Department under Trump has retrenched on voting rights litigation. Even administrations interested in broadly enforcing the VRA had limited litigation resources and relied on private advocacy groups.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It was like a ray of hope’\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit highlighting Brown and the bench used by Judge Davies, known as the “Cooper Bench,” is scheduled to remain at the Supreme Court until next summer. Then the artifacts will  return to a permanent exhibit  in Arkansas.\n \n\n   \n  In the current video, the justices touch on dramatic highpoints, including Davies’ bravery in the face of threats and violence, President Dwight Eisenhower’s order of the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock, and the leadership of lawyer Thurgood Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  Marshall, as lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, developed the strategy against the “separate but equal” doctrine. In 1967, he became the first Black Supreme Court justice.\n \n\n   \n  The only Black justices since Marshall are Thomas, who succeeded him in 1991, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, appointed in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  The views of Thomas and Jackson on racial remedies and the legacy of Brown are the opposite. They  fiercely clashed  in the SFFA v. Harvard case.\n \n\n   \n  In the exhibit film, they offer observations from personal experience. Jackson refers to her parents, who grew up in the era of segregation, and were able to see her become a Supreme Court  justice.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas recalls the reverence people showed to Brown v. Board in his youth: “They would say ‘Brown,’ as though they had the familiarity of a constitutional scholar. ‘Brown.’”\n \n\n   \n  “For people who were unlettered, for people who were living in that system,” Thomas also relates, “Brown was a godsend, because it said that what was happening that we thought was wrong, they now know that this court said it was also wrong. It’s wrong, not just morally, but under the Constitution of the United States. It was like a ray of hope.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/asia/south-korea-exam-flights-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"09:10:00.000-05:00","title":"South Korea Bans Flights as 500,000 Take Crucial University Admission Test","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea saw a record number of 554,174 students take its crucial university entrance exam in November 2025, the highest since 2019.

Ford, will arrive in the northern Caribbean on Sunday as tensions with Venezuela grow, according to a U.S. military official. The carrier will join 15,000 service members, including 2,000 Marines aboard an amphibious assault ship. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR the \"table is being set\" for possible military action. Administration officials are continuing to hold high-level meetings with members of Congress and foreign leaders amid ongoing military exercises. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It remains unclear, however, if President Trump will use military force against Venezuela. The U.S. has conducted 20 strikes on boats in the region so far, saying they were ferrying drugs trafficked from the country. In August, the U.S. government set a  $50 million reward  for the arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. But officials told NPR that the arrival of the USS Gerald Ford, which was pulled from the Mediterranean Sea, could be just another pressure tactic on Maduro, who has put his own forces on high alert. On Friday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, \"I sort of made up my mind\" about whether to launch an attack. \"I can't tell you what it is,\" he said, \"but we made a lot of progress with Venezuela in terms of stopping drugs from pouring in.\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Thursday  on social media  that a \"mission\" was under way called \"Operation Southern Spear.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,\" he wrote. \"The Western Hemisphere is America's neighborhood and we will protect it.\" The increased activity comes after the  high-profile resignation  last month of U.S. four-star Adm. Alvin Holsey, who had been overseeing the boat strikes. He abruptly left his post two years early. Pentagon sources told NPR they believe it was because he objected to the assaults on the alleged drug boats, which have so far killed 80 people, and struck boats that did not appear to be showing any immediate hostile intent. NPR's Tom Bowman and Quil Lawrence contributed to this report. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/health/tick-bite-alpha-gal-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00-04:00","title":"New Jersey man is first known death from meat allergy triggered by tick bites","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 47-year-old man from New Jersey died suddenly in 2024 after consuming red meat following exposure to lone star tick bites during a camping trip.

Doctors were initially unaware of the condition, and a 2023 CDC survey found that many medical professionals lack knowledge or confidence in diagnosing it.

13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the summer of 2024, a previously healthy 47-year-old father collapsed and died in the bathroom of his New Jersey home. An autopsy provided no answers. Everything looked normal, and his death was ruled sudden and unexplained.\n \n\n   \n  His widow reached out to a friend, a pediatrician. Would she read the autopsy report?\n \n\n   \n  The pediatrician, Dr. Erin McFeely, acted on a hunch and contacted Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia who had discovered almost two decades earlier that tick bites could cause people to develop an allergy to red meat.\n \n\n   \n  The allergy is unusual because the reaction doesn’t happen right away. People start to feel sick hours after they unwittingly eat beef, pork or lamb. Often, they’ll wake up in the middle of the night with symptoms that seem more like a bad bout of food poisoning or stomach flu than an allergy.\n \n\n   \n  Because so many people have potentially been sensitized to meat after tick bites but don’t know it, Platts-Mills and others have wondered whether there were unexplained deaths that were really severe reactions to a sugar found on mammalian cells, including those in red meat, called alpha-gal.\n \n\n   \n   The man’s case , which was detailed Wednesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice, turned out to be exactly what Platts-Mills had feared and is believed to be the first documented death linked to a red meat allergy.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time I’ve heard a story that I thought we could sort out,” said Platts-Mills, who is part scientist and part Sherlock Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  “We need the serum” – the clear part of the patient’s blood – which was taken during his autopsy. He asked McFeely, “Can we get it?”\n \n\n   \n    Tick bites turn deadly\n \n\n   \n  The man’s story started with chigger bites, the case study says. But they weren’t chiggers; they were baby lone star ticks, about the size and color of a grain of sand.\n \n\n   \n  The man had been bitten by dozens of these tiny seed ticks on a camping trip with his family.\n \n\n   \n  “And this tick, the mothers, lay 5,000 eggs at a time, and the larvae will bite you,” Platts-Mills told CNN . \n \n\n   \n  In many parts of the eastern United States, the deer population has reached unsustainable numbers. Deer are the main hosts of the lone star tick, and as deer populations have grown, tick populations have exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “That combination of so many deer and so many mothers and the larvae biting means that vast numbers of people are sensitized, of whom a minority get food-related symptoms and then are at risk of severe events,” Platts-Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Alpha-gal allergy is a reportable diagnosis in only three states – Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia – so the actual number of cases in the US is not known. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates  that as many as 450,000 Americans may have the allergy, but Platts-Mills estimates that as much as 5% of the population may be sensitized to red meat because of tick bites and not know it.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are not severe and can be managed by avoiding exposure to the sugar, which is found in food as well as in some pharmaceutical products. Symptoms range in severity from itchy hives or a rash to nausea and vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the lips or face, dizziness or fainting, and severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnose the condition by taking a careful history and controlled testing for a reaction to the sugar.\n \n\n   \n  Sometime after the camping trip, the case study says, the man’s family ate a late steak dinner. He woke at 2 a.m. with intense stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. He was in rough shape, but after two hours, his symptoms subsided.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, he told one of his sons, “I thought I was going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  His wife said they considered going to a doctor, but since the symptoms had eased, they didn’t know what they would say.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that a doctor’s visit would have helped. Too often, doctors don’t recognize alpha-gal allergy.  A 2023 CDC survey  found that 42% didn’t know what it was, and 35% said they lacked confidence to diagnose or manage it.\n \n\n   \n    An unrecognized allergy\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks later, in September 2024, the man and his wife went to a cookout, where he had a hamburger about 3 p.m. He drank a beer and came home and mowed the lawn. But by 7:20 p.m., he was vomiting again. His son called his mother and told her, “Dad is getting sick again.”\n \n\n   \n  A few minutes later, the son found his father unconscious on the bathroom floor. He couldn’t be revived.\n \n\n   \n  Platts-Mills says that when he   was back in his lab, having gone through the necessary layers of permission to get the man’s postmortem blood samples, he cursed himself for not driving up to New Jersey to collect them himself.\n \n\n   \n  The delivery company lost track of them briefly, he said. He imagined them sitting for hours in the back of a hot truck, the valuable information they contained being baked away.\n \n\n   \n  They finally arrived in his lab in April, and he tested them for levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies, Y-shaped proteins primed to latch onto allergens like ragweed and pollen. The man had antibodies to both alpha-gal sugars and red meat.\n \n\n   \n  Next, Platts-Mills sent some of the blood to the Mayo Clinic lab, which tested it for an enzyme called tryptase that’s made by immune cells called mast cells. Tryptase breaks down proteins and is a marker of allergic reactions.\n \n\n   \n  The man’s tryptase levels were over 2,000 nanograms per milliliter, among the highest values ever recorded in cases of fatal allergic reactions called anaphylaxis.\n \n\n   \n  The man had died of eating red meat – the first known food allergy fatality linked to alpha-gal syndrome.\n \n\n   \n  Other people  have died of reactions to alpha-gal sugars , but those cases have involved sugars attached to a chemotherapy drug called cetuximab, which was how the syndrome was discovered in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “We gave them closure,” Platts-Mills said of the family in the case study.   “People make a big fuss about closure, but you don’t get it until you see it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608227","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Right-wing media shrugs off latest Epstein document release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly released documents linking Jeffrey Epstein to high-level figures, including Donald Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell, have sparked controversy and speculation.

material  reveal about the well-documented relationship between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and President Donald Trump? Not much of anything, according to some of the right-wing influencers who have long been clamoring for the government to release  more information  about Epstein and his crimes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"To me, these are nothingburgers. If they're even real,\" pro-Trump podcaster Jon Herold said on his Badlands Media Rumble livestream on Wednesday. Herold gained an audience in the wake of the 2020 election after  spreading QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories . His fellow Badlands Media personality, Brian Lupo, took a slightly different view on his own livestream this week. The emails didn't exactly say nothing, he claimed, but they show that Trump was informing on Epstein and his associate  Ghislaine Maxwell , who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. (Epstein died by suicide while in jail during the first Trump administration.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"My take on this is Epstein and Maxwell are trying to figure out who's a mole or a rat or an informant in their circle of friends,\" Lupo said, referring to an email in which Epstein called Trump a \"dog that didn't bark.\" (The White House has denied that Trump was an informant.) Epstein  looms large  for many  conspiracy theorists , including QAnon believers. He's seen as a prime example of the satanic cabal of pedophiles they believe are entrenched among the world's most powerful people. QAnon adherents think Donald Trump is destined to defeat that cabal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein were once friendly but fell out decades ago. He's denied any knowledge of Epstein's trafficking of underage girls. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While one of the newly released emails suggests Trump did know about Epstein's behavior, some right-wing media figures say the new disclosures prove Trump did nothing wrong. \"They're claiming it's a hoax, they're claiming that the Democrats are cherry-picking the things that make Trump look the worst, and that these things prove that he didn't actually do anything wrong and that he's not a criminal and that he was actually gathering information for the FBI on Epstein,\" said Mike Rothschild, an independent journalist and author who has written extensively about conspiracy theories and QAnon. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said that is \"very different from the song they were singing for years before that, which is that if we just bring down the Epstein ring, all of the Democrats are going to go down with him.\" Many prominent Democrats are shown communicating with Epstein in the newly released emails. Still, another common thread on the right is that the release is a  distraction  by Democrats. \"They think that the Epstein thing is something that is going to distract you from their failures, although the Epstein thing, all it's really doing is exposing more Democrat failures,\" Vince Coglianese, a radio host and the editorial director of the Daily Caller, said on his Rumble livestream on Thursday. That echoes President Trump's Truth Social posts accusing Democrats of using Epstein to deflect from fallout over the  government shutdown . On Friday, he called on the Justice Department to investigate Democrats mentioned in the emails. Attorney General  Pam Bondi said  she was appointing a federal prosecutor to lead a probe. Meanwhile, some prominent influencers and conservative media outlets are essentially ignoring this week's release of documents. \"They already know that their fans are on board 100% with whatever Trump does,\" Rothschild said. \"There's nothing for them here.\" At the same time, the emails are fueling new speculation on both the right and the left as people race to interpret Epstein's often cryptic language. To Rothschild, that is a fool's errand. \"Jeffrey Epstein was, like, not the most trustworthy person…You're taking him at his word because you want to believe him when he says things that are either good about Trump or bad about Trump,\" he said. \"It's absolutely maddening circular discourse and it gets us absolutely nowhere.\" NPR's Huo Jingnan contributed reporting to this story.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/asia/south-korea-yoon-drone-charges-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Phone Notes Reveal Alleged Plan to Bait Kim Jong Un with Drones","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korean prosecutors have released memos from a former defense official’s phone alleging that former President Yoon Suk Yeol and senior defense officials planned to provoke North Korea by sending drones into Pyongyang to drop anti-regime leaflets.

Weeks later, Yoon declared martial law, citing the need to protect the liberal South from “North Korean communist forces.”\n \n\n   \n  The snap decree was lifted within hours when South Korean lawmakers pushed past troops to vote it down, the first step in a reckoning for Yoon that’s still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n   A new indictment Monday  adds to Yoon’s mounting legal battles, which include a trial underway for alleged insurrection, and provides more pieces to a political puzzle that’s yet to be fully explained.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon denies he ordered drones to fly to Pyongyang to provoke North Korea and that he attempted to stage an insurrection through martial law.\n \n\n   \n  Yoo Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon’s lawyers, called the indictment “a one-sided prosecution” that “fails to uphold even the basic tenets of legal logic, beyond being absurd.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the spokesperson and a prosecutor for the counsel, Park Ji-young, said prosecutors were “appalled” at what they had uncovered – and on Monday they released memos they say support their claim.\n \n\n   \n    Drones buzzing Kim’s home\n \n\n   \n  The allegations date back to last October, when North Korean state media reported that South Korean drones had  violated Pyongyang’s airspace  on multiple occasions, dropping anti‑regime leaflets.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released photos showing one drone lodged in a tree, described by analysts as resembling a South Korean military unmanned aerial vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  KCNA also showed images of a drone it said was spotted flying low in the skies above the home of North’s Korean authoritarian supreme leader.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Byung-joo, a retired Korean Army four-star general now a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic Party, which sits in opposition to Yoon’s former party, told CNN in July that he had received details of the drone flights directly from whistleblowers of South Korea’s Drone Operations Command.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kim, the flights took place on at least three occasions, October 3, October 8-9, and November 13 of last year.\n \n\n   \n  “It is believed that by sending drones into the heart of North Korea and dropping leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un, the aim was to provoke a military response from the North,” the South Korean lawmaker told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like holding a knife to (North Korea’s) neck,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Kim Yo Jong issued her statement on October 12, condemning the airspace incursions and warning of “severe consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Kim Yong-hyun, then South Korea’s defense minister, initially denied sending drones to North Korea, but soon changed his response to say he “could not confirm” North Korea’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  After Yoon’s disastrous attempt to impose martial law, lawmakers from the now ruling Democratic Party demanded an inquiry into allegations the former president conspired to spark a national security crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Once in power, the lawmakers passed a bill to appoint an independent counsel, who released memos on Monday that they say reveal evidence of covert discussions about Yoon’s plans to provoke North Korea, a country with a long history of bombastic threats against South Korea and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  Among notes found on a phone belonging to the former Defense Counterintelligence Commander Yeo In-hyung were references to creating an “unstable situation,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Must find and exploit a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that can produce short-term effects. To do that, we must create an unstable situation or seize an opportunity that has been created,” read one note drafted October 18 last year, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Another note read: “Targeting where (North Korea) loses face to such an extent that they feel they have no option but to respond.” Locations listed included the capital, two nuclear facilities, Kim’s vacation homes, as well as Samjiyon and Wonsan.\n \n\n   \n  Samjiyon is regarded as a sacred site in North Korea for being the birthplace of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, and a symbolic location tied to his grandfather’s anti-Japanese resistance.\n \n\n   \n  The Wonsan-Kalma tourist area is one of Kim Jong Un’s flagship development projects, that has been hailed as a “great success” by the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Another memo from October 23 stated, “Goal and final status,” containing phrases such as “At minimum-national security crisis” and “At maximum-Noah’s flood,” in a possible reference to Noah’s Ark, where the only survivors of a biblical flood were those on board a mighty ship.\n \n\n   \n  A later note dated November 5 stated, “Enemy action must come first. There must be a wartime situation or a situation that cannot be controlled by police forces. Create the enemy’s conditions… we must wait for the decisive opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Park, the prosecutor’s spokesperson, said further details could not be disclosed due to laws concerning military secrets.\n \n\n   \n  However, she added that evidence from a notebook belonging to former Defense Intelligence Commander Noh Sang-won suggested that discussions and preparations for the martial law were believed to have begun no later than October 2023, after a major reshuffle of South Korea’s military generals.\n \n\n   \n  “The (alleged) act of the President, who holds supreme command over national security, and the defense minister, attempting to use inter-Korean military tensions to create conditions for declaring martial law, is absolutely unacceptable,” said Park.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmaker Kim Byung-joo, the retired general, said he was surprised the North Korean leader did not order a response after alleged South Korean drones were spotted over the capital.\n \n\n   \n  “In hindsight, it was a godsend luck for South Korea that North Korea refrained from any military provocation and stopped at rhetorical threats,” he said. “Had North Korea chosen to respond with military action under those circumstances, it could have escalated into a localized conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s deployment of more than 10,000 troops to Russia as combat soldiers in the war against Ukraine may have dissuaded Kim from acting further, said Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “North Korea could have found it difficult to maintain two war fronts, at the time. Because it would have meant causing a significant gap in combat capability.”\n \n\n   \n    A frustrated leader’s shocking act\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, and his former defense officials Kim and Yeo, all face charges of harming the interest of the state by helping the enemy and abusing their power. The three are already on trial on insurrection charges relating to the  martial law declaration. \n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military has yet to comment on the investigation or the indictment, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.  CNN has reached out to lawyers for Kim and Yeo. According to local media, Yeo has said he deeply regrets not challenging Yoon’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, a firebrand conservative who has long taken a hardline on North Korea, narrowly won election in 2022, but his ruling party never had a majority in parliament, and struggled to get its legislative agenda passed. It was a source of constant frustration for his administration, and towards the end of last year, that frustration exploded in spectacular fashion.\n \n\n   \n  On December 3, Yoon declared martial law in a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within the opposition parties in the government that were sympathetic to North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopters and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television.\n \n\n   \n  Though assembly members pushed through the soldiers and voted to overturn the martial law decree, Yoon’s actions triggered mass protests, legal challenges, and ultimately, his removal through impeachment.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say sending drone flights into North Korea could have been interpreted as an act of war, provoking a military response that could have escalated into war.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Peninsula has been divided ever since a brutal war between the North and South ended with an armistice agreement in 1953. But the hostilities have never officially ended and relations between the two neighbors have been precarious ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said if Yoon had ordered the drone flights, it “would represent a dangerous interaction of domestic politics and security policy” in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  “While some national security activities are necessarily clandestine and operate in legal gray areas, robust checks, balances, and policy vetting should ensure they serve national interests rather than personal agendas,” Easley said.\n \n\n   \n  Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the potential international ramifications of the case are considerable, especially for the United States, a South Korean treaty ally with tens of thousands of troops at bases on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Drone flights into North Korea, he added, would violate the armistice agreement between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that the North Koreans violate the armistice all the time, but they’re not held politically accountable for it at home,” he said. “In a democracy like South Korea you can be held politically accountable for that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609876","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-05:00","title":"Judge indefinitely bars Trump from fining UC over alleged discrimination","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Rita Lin, has issued an indefinite preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from fining or cutting federal funding to the University of California—particularly UCLA—based on allegations of antisemitism or discrimination.

administration cannot fine the University of California or summarily cut the school system's federal funding over claims it allows antisemitism or other forms of discrimination, a federal judge ruled late Friday in a sharply worded decision. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction barring the administration from cancelling funding to UC based on alleged discrimination without giving notice to affected faculty and conducting a hearing, among other requirements. The administration over the summer demanded the University of California, Los Angeles pay $1.2 billion to restore frozen research funding and ensure eligibility for future funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus. UCLA was the first public university to be targeted by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations. It has also frozen or paused federal funding over similar claims against private colleges, including Columbia University. In her ruling, Lin said labor unions and other groups representing UC faculty, students and employees had provided \"overwhelming evidence\" that the Trump administration was \"engaged in a concerted campaign to purge 'woke,' 'left,' and 'socialist' viewpoints from our country's leading universities.\" \"Agency officials, as well as the President and Vice President, have repeatedly and publicly announced a playbook of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding, with the goal of bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,\" Lin wrote. She added, \"It is undisputed that this precise playbook is now being executed at the University of California.\" At UC, which is facing a series of civil rights probes, she found the administration had engaged in \"coercive and retaliatory conduct in violation of the First Amendment and Tenth Amendment.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Messages sent to the White House and the U.S. Department of Justice after hours Friday were not immediately returned. Lin's order will remain in effect indefinitely. University of California President James B. Milliken has said the size of the UCLA fine would devastate the UC system, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation. UC is in settlement talks with the administration and is not a party to the lawsuit before Lin, who was nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat. In a statement, the university system said it \"remains committed to protecting the mission, governance, and academic freedom of the University.\" The administration has demanded UCLA comply with its views on gender identity and establish a process to make sure foreign students are not admitted if they are likely to engage in anti-American, anti-Western or antisemitic \"disruptions or harassment,\" among other requirements outlined in a settlement proposal made public in October. The administration has previously struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million. Lin cited declarations by UC faculty and staff that the administration's moves were prompting them to stop teaching or researching topics they were \"afraid were too 'left' or 'woke.'\" Her injunction also blocks the administration from \"conditioning the grant or continuance of federal funding on the UC's agreement to any measures that would violate the rights of Plaintiffs' members under the First Amendment.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She cited efforts to force the UCs to screen international students based on \"'anti-Western\" or \"'anti-American'\" views, restrict research and teaching, or adopt specific definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as examples of such measures.

       \n        \n      \n\n         A decades-long boom in brain science in the United States may be heading for a bust. Ongoing disruptions in federal funding are causing many young brain scientists to reconsider their career choice, according to leaders of the  Society for Neuroscience  (SfN), which represents more than 37,000 researchers and clinicians. If those scientists change fields or leave the country, SfN officials say, it could hobble the nation's efforts to understand and treat brain disorders including Alzheimer's, autism, Parkinson's and schizophrenia. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The U.S. has been a world leader in research for decades, and that leadership position is now at risk,\" says  John Morrison , a professor at the University of California, Davis and president of SfN. Morrison expects that discussions about federal funding are likely to have a prominent place in the group's annual five-day meeting, which begins Saturday in San Diego and is expected to attract about 20,000 brain scientists. \"It's hard to escape, because we're all being directly affected by it,\" Morrison says. Science, disrupted In the months since President Trump took office, the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation have been buffeted by cuts, grant terminations, and abrupt policy changes. Federal health officials have said those measures reflect an effort to reduce fraud and waste, end support of 'woke' science, and align research with the administration's priorities. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the process has been unsettling for young scientists like  Clara Zundel , a postdoctoral researcher at Wayne State University in Detroit. Zundel, who studies how pollution affects the developing brain, currently has funding from the National Institutes of Health. But consideration of an NIH grant that would extend her funding has been delayed, she says. As a result, she decided not to spend the money to attend this year's neuroscience meeting. Instead, she's focusing on finding a job in an increasingly tight market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Many universities are still on partial or even full hiring freezes,\" Zundel says. \"So it's just made it really scary to think how I'm going to take that next step.\" Zundel isn't ready to abandon her career plans just yet. \"I absolutely love what I do, and I want to continue doing what I do,\" she says. Still. \"Talk to me in another three months,\" she says, \"and I might change my mind.\" Other young researchers are even less certain, Morrison says. \"You hear things like, 'I've prepared my whole life for this. Is it gone now? Is it no longer possible to be the scientist that I always wanted to be?'\" he says. \"Many will just choose something else.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Others may take their research to another country. And if funding cuts and uncertainty persist, Morrison says, the field of neuroscience could lose a whole generation of scientists. Congress funds, White House cuts    The NIH often awards five-year grants, and scientists tend to structure their research around that timeline. But in recent months, many grants have been paused or prematurely terminated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If you disrupt the grant in the middle, the work you've already done [may be] worthless,\" Morrison says. He also challenges the administration's claim that it is saving taxpayers' money. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the long run, he says, the human and financial costs of cutting research will be huge. Take Alzheimer's. Research into the neurodegenerative disorder costs the federal government a few billion dollars per year, Morrison says. But caring for people with the disease costs far more — hundreds of billions of dollars a year. And that cost, he says, will continue to rise until researchers find better treatments or a way to prevent the disease. Morrison says it's an excellent example of a principle expressed by the late  Mary Lasker , a philanthropist and champion of medical research, who famously said: \"If you think research is expensive, try disease.\" That sentiment is one reason brain science has long enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, says  Diane Lipscombe , a professor at Brown University and chair of the government and public affairs committee at the Society for Neuroscience. Another is that, ever since World War II, science has been a huge boost to the U.S. economy, she says. That's because publicly-funded research not only helps train future physicians and scientists, it leads to new drugs and medical devices, biotech companies that spin off from universities, and patents on vaccines, cancer treatments, and even gene-editing technology. \"I don't think we've ever talked with anyone in the [House] or Senate who disagreed with that,\" Lipscombe says. But the current round of cuts and disruptions have come from the executive branch, not Congress. So neuroscientists are taking their case directly to the public. The Society's website, for example, now includes  links  to videos of scientists explaining the work they do and why it matters. Lipscombe thinks that message will be heard. So when she talks to young scientists asking for career advice, she tries to offer an optimistic message. \"You just have to stay with what you love because things will get better,\" she says. At least, that's the hope. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607064","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00Z","title":"More liberals, people of color and LGBTQ Americans say they're buying guns out of fear","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article reports a significant increase in gun ownership among liberals, people of color, and LGBTQ Americans in the United States, particularly since President Donald Trump's reelection in 2024.

Although most owners say they would only use guns for self-defense and not for aggression, the article raises concerns that the motivation—fear—undermines the democratic and social values of peaceful coexistence.

5:30 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When Charles was growing up in the 1970s in Brooklyn, N.Y., his mother was so strict, she forbade toy guns of any kind, including squirt guns. \"I remember vividly, summertime, when my friends would have water gun fights and I couldn't participate,\" he recalls. He grew up and became a doctor, and these days, he heads to a shooting range in Maryland each week for target practice with his Smith & Wesson .380. Charles, who is Black, says he bought the handgun after the Trump administration did things that scared him, including arresting a foreign student who criticized her university's policy on Israel and handcuffing a U.S. senator who was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security news conference. \"What I'm talking about is protecting myself from a situation where there may be some kind of civil unrest,\" says Charles. Like most people who spoke with NPR for this story, he asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. Charles says he worries that some of President Trump's supporters may feel emboldened someday to target minorities like him and his family. \"He could dispatch citizens or the government,\" Charles says. \"I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer.\" Changing face of American gun ownership For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican, but that's been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and academic researchers. They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ folks have been buying guns for years and particularly since Trump's reelection in 2024. This story was based on more than 30 interviews. David Phillips is on the training team of the Liberal Gun Club, which has chapters in more than 30 states and provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. He says club membership has grown from 2,700 in November to 4,500 today. Requests for training, he says, have quintupled. \"The concern is about the supporters of the right-wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like,\" Phillips says. Asked about these concerns, the White House dismissed NPR's reporting. \"Instead of covering Americans exercising their Second Amendment Right and trying to disingenuously blame President Trump, NPR should highlight the dangerous language from elected Democrats that has driven leftists to commit actual violence against Republicans – including the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. Jackson said stories like this one are why NPR no longer receives federal funding. \"That's something we can all celebrate,\" she added. Trump has also blamed what he calls \"the radical left\" for demonizing him and his supporters and inspiring political violence. But many liberals who spoke for this story say it's the other way around. They say the president   dehumanizes others with his rhetoric. For instance, Trump has said undocumented immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" The president has also called his political opponents, \"radical left thugs that live like vermin.\" Despite White House claims to the contrary, there is ample anecdotal evidence that more people are buying guns because some of the administration's policies frighten them. \"Never seen a surge like this before\" \"As everyone knows, there has been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election,\" said Tom Nguyen, speaking on YouTube to his LA Progressive Shooters gun club just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration. Nguyen said the club's Pistol 101 classes were already booked out for nine months. \"I've never seen a surge like this before,\" said Thomas Boyer, spokesperson for the San Francisco Chapter of the Pink Pistols, whose motto is: \"Armed gays don't get bashed.\" Even traditional Second Amendment groups say more liberals are seeking gun training. \"It's definitely common knowledge at this point,\" said Taylor Rhodes, communications director for the National Association for Gun Rights. There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them, but the phrase \"How do I buy a gun?\" spiked a number of times in the past year, according to Google Trends. Those spikes happened around the time of Trump's 2024 election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C. This recent surge in liberals buying guns is the latest in a years-long trend. For instance, a University of Chicago study found that gun ownership by Democrats or Democrat-leaning people rose by 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2022. David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, says the events of 2020 and early 2021 – the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot – were particular drivers. \"We do know that in that year that new gun owners were disproportionately African American (and) disproportionately female,\" Yamane said. Only for self-protection Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would use the weapons only for self-protection and would not engage law enforcement. \"All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone,\" says MJ, a member of a liberal, self-defense group in the Midwest who asked NPR not to use his full name because he feared retribution. \"If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group.\" Bill Sack, director of legal operations with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation, says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their right to self-defense – but he isn't happy about why. \"Is it a good thing that people are scared?\" he says. \"No, of course not.\" Every new gun owner who spoke to NPR said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said that if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun. \"As a man, as a father, as a husband, how remiss and derelict would it be for me to not be prepared?\" says Charles, the Maryland doctor. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican. Well, that has been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and researchers. They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ people have been buying guns for years, especially since last year's election. NPR's Frank Langfitt spoke with some of them to find out why. His story was based on more than 30 interviews. And a warning, it includes the sound of gunfire. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Charles grew up in Brooklyn, New York, in the middle of housing projects. This was back in the '70s. His mother, deeply religious, forbid guns of any kind. CHARLES: So I couldn't even play with a water gun. And I remember vividly summertime when my friends would have water gun fights, and I couldn't participate. LANGFITT: Charles, who's Black, now works as a doctor in Maryland. He comes to this shooting range to practice every week with his new gun. CHARLES: This is a Smith & Wesson .380. And then my next gun will be the Glock, and I already have a shotgun. LANGFITT: Charles said he decided to buy a gun after the Trump administration did things that scared him - the arrest of a foreign student who criticized her university's policy on Israel, the handcuffing of a U.S. senator. Charles worries ordinary citizens like him could eventually be targeted. CHARLES: What I'm talking about is protecting myself from a situation where there may be some kind of chaotic civil unrest and the streets become something we don't recognize. LANGFITT: And that civil unrest that you expect would be triggered by the president or the administration through rhetoric? CHARLES: He has it all. He can dispatch citizens or the government. It doesn't matter. He could do both. And I'm not saying that that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer. LANGFITT: Charles and some others interviewed for this story asked to be identified only by their first names. They fear retaliation from the Trump administration. Charles has a 19-year-old daughter named Charley. She's on the taller side and joins her dad for gun training each week. CHARLEY: I need to practice my headshots. Because of my height, it does make it harder. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) LANGFITT: Charley says she fears for her safety because of her race and gender. The day after the election, a man drove onto her college campus and hurled racial slurs at Black students. CHARLEY: Some people - they hate us so much that they really try to make it known how much we're not wanted here. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) LANGFITT: You mean Black people. CHARLEY: Yes. Especially Black people, women, and also, I feel like who's targeted now is just liberals because of Trump's second term. LANGFITT: White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson dismissed NPR's reporting for this story as, quote, \"disingenuous and biased\" and a reason why the network no longer receives federal funding. President Trump has blamed what he calls the radical left for political violence. He cited his near assassination last year and the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible. For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. LANGFITT: Many liberals who spoke to NPR say it's the president who demonizes others, whether it be undocumented immigrants... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They're poisoning the blood of our country. That's what they've done. LANGFITT: ...Or political opponents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxist, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections and will do anything possible - they'll do anything, whether legally or illegally, to destroy America and to destroy the American dream. DAVID PHILLIPS: I'm David Phillips, and I'm on the training team for The Liberal Gun Club. LANGFITT: The Liberal Gun Club has chapters in more than 30 states. It provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. PHILLIPS: Since the second inauguration of Trump, we have seen an incredible increase in interest in training with firearms. The concern is about the supporters of the right wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod, at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like. LANGFITT: Phillips says club membership has grown by two-thirds since November, from 2,700 members to 4,500. Requests for training have quintupled. Gun clubs with similar membership say they've been seeing the same thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) TOM NGUYEN: Hey folks. As everyone knows, there's been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election, and we've been booked out to September for individuals wanting to take our Pistol 101 class. HOPE: We have seen an increase of membership across our chapters of around 40%. THOMAS BOYER: I've never seen a surge like this before. LANGFITT: That was Tom Nguyen, who runs the LA Progressive Shooters gun club, speaking just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration, followed by a woman named Hope, who helps lead the Socialist Rifle Association, and Thomas Boyer, with the San Francisco chapter of the Pink Pistols. Their motto? Armed gays don't get bashed. Even traditional Second Amendment groups acknowledge more liberals are seeking gun training out of fear. Taylor Rhodes works with the National Association for Gun Rights. TAYLOR RHODES: It's definitely common knowledge at this point. I think we saw a little bit of it, you know, right after the first Trump inauguration. LANGFITT: There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them. But the phrase, how do I buy a gun, spiked a number of times in the last year, according to Google Trends. The spikes came around the time of Trump's election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C. David Yamane is a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University. He says the nation's volatile politics have been driving more liberals and minorities to buy guns for some time. DAVID YAMANE: We definitely saw something similar happening in the COVID year of 2020, where we rolled straight from the pandemic into the summer of the George Floyd murder protests and then rolling straight from there into a contested presidential election. And there we do have some data. We do know that in that year, that new gun owners were disproportionately African American. They were disproportionately female. LANGFITT: Gun ownership among liberals has been on the rise long before Trump's reelection. In 2022, a University of Chicago study found that 29% of Democrats or Democrat-leaning people nationwide had a gun at home. That's seven percentage points higher than a dozen years earlier. Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would only use the weapons for self-protection and would not engage with law enforcement. MJ is a member of a liberal self-defense group in the Midwest. MJ: All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone at all - absolutely not. If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group. LANGFITT: Bill Sack is with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation. He says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their rights to self-defense, but he has a caveat. BILL SACK: Is it a good thing that people are scared? No, of course not. LANGFITT: Every new gun owner NPR interviewed for this story said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said, if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun. Frank Langfitt, NPR News.

\n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 9:10 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         There's a new twist in the saga of the U.S.-purchased contraceptives intended for sub-Saharan Africa and stuck in Belgium since the Trump administration scaled back foreign aid earlier this year. This week, questions were raised about whether the stockpile, originally valued at $9.7 million, might be bigger than previously thought. And an official on the ground said some of those products have gone bad. Authorities in the Flanders region of Belgium confirmed that in addition to the four truckloads' worth of unexpired birth control sitting in a warehouse in the city of Geel, another 20 truckloads of supplies ended up in the village of Kallo but were stored improperly and are therefore unusable — at least as contraceptives. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The medicines in the 20 relocated shipments, due to non-compliant storage, cannot be brought back into circulation,\" Jo Brouns, the Flemish minister of the environment,  wrote in published responses  to a lawmaker's question. \"On the other hand, the medical devices in these shipments, such as syringes for injected contraceptives, are still eligible for reuse — provided the other pharmaceutical requirements are met.\" Along with the  dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development  (USAID) earlier this year, the U.S. specifically halted family planning programs — for which it had long been the world's largest bilateral donor — because it did not consider them  lifesaving , despite vast evidence showing such services reduce maternal and newborn deaths. As a result, a shipment of contraceptives that had been earmarked for girls and women in a number of low-income countries — including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Mali, Tanzania and Zambia — ended up stranded in Belgium. Several aid groups tried to buy and redistribute the supply of IUDs, implants and pills, but said the  U.S. rejected their offers . The Trump administration has cited a policy that bars foreign organizations from using U.S. funds to provide abortion services, even though the products in the stockpile do not include any abortion methods. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then, in July, the State Department confirmed that it planned to use taxpayer money to incinerate the products in France by the end of the month, even though they wouldn't expire until 2027 at the earliest. That sparked an outcry from humanitarian groups worldwide, including the  Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition  (RHSC), which said the destruction of the single stockpile could result in 362,000 unintended pregnancies, 161,000 unplanned births, 110,000 unsafe abortions and 718 preventable maternal deaths. The government's late-July deadline came and went without confirmation of the destruction, giving aid groups hope. And in September, after USAID told  The New York Times  that the stocks had been destroyed, Belgian authorities checked the warehouse and  confirmed they were still there . As Brouns confirmed this week, it turns out those weren't the only contraceptives left in limbo. What's in those truckloads? The disclosure raises more questions  Brouns said his administration conducted an on-site inspection of the warehouse in mid-August after hearing the products were being shipped to France. \"There appeared to be no planned shipments to France,\" he wrote. \"However, it was determined that 20 of the 24 shipments in total had already been transferred to another storage location in Kallo, which is not specifically equipped for the storage of medicines.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It is not clear exactly what kinds of products were transferred to Kallo or if they were part of the original stockpile. NPR has reached out to the State Department for more information but did not hear back by publication time. Marcel van Valen, head of supply chain at International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), told NPR over email they believe the 20 truckloads are \"additional products at risk of incineration\" on top of the $9.7 million in the warehouse.  Aid groups want the rest distributed before it's too late Brouns, the Flemish minister, stressed that while the contraceptives in Kallo cannot be reused, their medical hardware can. That's in addition to the shipments stored in the Geel warehouse. Brouns wrote that his administration is in close contact with the minister of foreign affairs, adding that \"diplomatic discussions and efforts are indeed crucial for these resources to still be put to (re)use.\" Reuters  reported in October  that such talks between the U.S. and Belgium were paused during the government shutdown. Humanitarian groups are calling on the Trump administration to release the products — either to a nongovernmental organization or a foreign government. Chiara Cosentino, coordinator for Countdown 2030 Europe — a coalition of European reproductive rights organizations — said in a statement that the administration's \"apparent strategy is to let these life-saving supplies expire rather than share them with those who need and want them.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It is unacceptable that the Trump Administration is holding hostage more than $9.7 million worth of U.S.-funded contraceptives — along with the health and well-being of 1.4 million women and girls in the Global South,\" she added. The sub-Saharan African countries where these products are needed — many of which are already experiencing humanitarian crises — are facing worsening contraceptive shortages as a result of the Trump administration's reduction in foreign aid. \"Since the discontinuation of USAID support, it has become much more difficult to continue our services,\" Dr. Bakari Omary, project coordinator of IPPF's member association in Tanzania, said  in a statement . \"Previously, anyone who wanted to avoid pregnancy could come to us and choose the contraceptive that suited them. Now women have to switch to whatever is available, or we cannot help them.\" Reproductive health advocates say the products stuck in Belgium are only part of the problem and that there are likely more contraceptives held up at other points in the global supply chain. One group,  PAI, says  the value of contraceptives supplies already purchased by the U.S. government but stuck in limbo at risk of expiration could be as high as $40 million. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582812","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:12:00-05:00","title":"This oil-producing country is moving away from oil.

  This oil-producing country is moving away from oil. Here's how it's going \n         By Julia Simon \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, November 12, 2025 • 1:12 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea. A few years ago , oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there. It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last. Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2023, Petro pledged to  stop approving new exploration contracts  for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step. Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going? When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil. But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says  Ana Carolina González Espinosa ,  senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says. \"I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,\" she says. \"But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.\" \"It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,\" she says. Why Colombia is doing this Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy. Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector. But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to  a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes . The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050. Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says  Guy Edwards , who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop. \" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,\" González Espinosa says, \"then we are going to be in trouble.\" Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol. The year before Petro took office, the company  acquired an electricity transmission company . In recent years, they've acquired more  solar  and  wind projects . And they're investing in  geothermal energy , drilling deep into the earth to create electricity. \"The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,\" Lemos says, \"but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.\" \"We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.\" Renewable progress and failures A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro. Solar made up around  9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024 , according to data from XM,  Colombia's electricity market operator . That's up from  roughly 1.5% in 2022 . Petro's government has introduced something called \"energy communities,\" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract  international financing  for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently  streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar  making it more efficient, says  Manuel Schulte , chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy. But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says. Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors  have given up on renewable projects ,  particularly wind projects . The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has  acquired some of these abandoned wind projects . Losing the messaging fight Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the \"myth,\" she says, that the country's energy transition \"will be an economic hindrance.\" \" The opposite,\" Muhamad says. \"What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.\" Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press.  His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines  have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as \"disastrous for the Colombian economy.\" Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels. \" They didn't resonate with the national audience,\" González Espinosa says in an email. \"It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.\" Looking to the future  Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote. As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal,  Estefanny Pardo , mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it. \"The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,\" Pardo says in Spanish. An upcoming conference Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023. Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production. Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels. If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through. \"Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   This week, world leaders are in Brazil for the annual U.N. climate conference to talk about how to cut planet-heating emissions. Scientists say a key way is for some fossil fuel-producing countries to stop exploring for new fossil fuels. One country's government decided to do just that - Colombia. NPR's Julia Simon went there to learn more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In a fishing village on Colombia's Caribbean coast, music plays in cafes lining the beach. It is cooler by the sea, where the wind blows through the trees. Out past the fishing boats, out in the turquoise sea, oil companies found deep water natural gas and planned to drill gas wells there. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, wants those wells to be among the country's last. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers, and President Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on climate change. Two years ago, at the U.N. climate conference, Petro took the stage and said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT GUSTAVO PETRO: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: \"Colombia,\" he says, \"has stopped signing exploration contracts for coal, oil and gas.\" This was a big deal. Stopping new exploration for fossil fuels is a key way to transition away from fossil fuels. Now the question is, how is Colombia's energy transition playing out? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). SIMON: OK. To find out, I went to a leafy neighborhood in central Bogota, in the high-rise office of Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol. There I met... JULIAN LEMOS: Julian Lemos. SIMON: ...Corporate vice president of strategy and new business. Lemos says the oil company is diversifying. Ecopetrol has acquired an electricity transmission company, more solar and wind projects, and they're investing in geothermal, drilling deep into the Earth to create electricity. LEMOS: The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company, but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power transmission. SIMON: Energy experts say this isn't just a good move for the climate. It's a good move for Colombia's economy. Colombia has manufacturing, tourism and agriculture, but the government is still very reliant on the oil and coal sectors for revenues. Ana Carolina Gonzalez Espinosa, at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute, says as Colombia's oil reserves shrink and demand for oil and coal eventually fall, that will be a problem. ANA CAROLINA GONZALEZ ESPINOSA: If we don't think about how we'll diversify the economy, then we are going to be in trouble. SIMON: Key to diversifying the energy sector is solar and wind. Solar, in particular, is growing - both large-scale and small-scale projects for communities lacking electricity. But the sector has problems too. In some parts of Colombia, the grid still isn't big enough to handle all the new solar and wind. Many projects are on land belonging to Indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve them in planning, says Margarita Nieves, a renewable energy researcher. She says some renewable developers have left. MARGARITA NIEVES: Each project has its own challenges. SIMON: Petro's term ends in 2026, and that raises another question. Will his energy policies outlast him? Petro's government hasn't awarded new licenses to explore for fossil fuels, but this isn't signed into law. A new, right-wing government could change gears and bring in more companies to explore for coal, oil and gas. So is Colombia's energy transition story a happy one? Gonzalez Espinosa has thoughts. GONZALEZ ESPINOSA: It is not a happy story. It is not a sad story. It's just a real story. SIMON: Julia Simon, NPR News, Bogota, Colombia.

They felt the house shake in the wind, then as floodwaters came, the building floated away. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I yelled at my kids to get up and group up here, on the stairs, just in case we tip over,\" David said when he  talked with public broadcaster KYUK . He and his children were still trapped inside. David says the home stopped floating when it hit a bridge. He talked with a KYUK reporter as he waited for rescuers to arrive. A month later, as villages across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta clean up from the storm and make repairs, hundreds of residents remain evacuated to cities such as Anchorage and Bethel. Now they face another loss. One of the few sources of local news and native language programming — public radio and television station KYUK — has lost federal funding that was  up to 70% of its budget  and plans to make cuts in January. The station plans to severely cut staff and some programming as it tries to raise money to fill the budget gap. The broader public media landscape is also experiencing  a loss of federal funding , including at least some money for improving  emergency alert systems , as human-caused climate change from burning fossil fuels is heating the planet and  increasing risks from extreme weather . In remote villages KYUK is \"crucial\" KYUK broadcasts out of a small tan building at the base of a tall tower in Bethel, Alaska — about 400 miles west of Anchorage. Bethel is a hub community for  56 tribes spread across 48 communities . The station says its coverage area is about the size of Louisiana. KYUK has been on the air since 1971 and \"is a  Native American initiated public broadcasting  joint licensee\" — that means it has both a public radio and television stations. It also has a  digital news website  and serves a predominantly Yup'ik population of less than 30,000 people in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Many residents, especially elders, primarily speak the Yup'ik language Yugtun. \"It's very crucial to have that KYUK network,\" says Darrel John, a lifelong resident of Kwigillingok. He says the news in Yugtun is especially valuable. \"A lot of great advice we listen to from the elders… Any updates from any other communities — you know what to look out for — and the upcoming events.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Each weekday, as  Morning Edition  ends, there's local news and the weather forecast in Yugtun. \"Weather is definitely one of the things that KYUK focuses on because it's life or death,\" says Sage Smiley, KYUK news director. In a place where there are few roads, residents sometimes drive on frozen rivers and need to know where it's safe to do that. \"Getting from community to community in a boat, on a snow machine, in a bush plane, the weather matters almost more than anything else,\" Smiley says. When it became clear the remnants of Typhoon Halong were headed toward the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Smiley says reporters started including that in their reports to warn residents. She says fall storms and even flooding are common in the region, but Halong was different from most. \"This storm took a track that was unexpected, hit south of where it was expected to and in an area that was less prepared for the storm to hit,\" Smiley says. \"I think all of those factors went into what made it so devastating.\" Three people in Kwigillingok died because of the storm. Nearly every building in the village was damaged. Overall  more than 1,600 people were displaced , many of them evacuated in helicopters. Smiley also coaches the high school swim team and was at a meet in another city when the storm arrived. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I was working remotely from a minivan with the swim team while the rest of the [news] team was working on the ground here,\" Smiley says in the news department studio in Bethel. \"And we had collaborators in Anchorage who were helping draft scripts and call communities to figure out what was happening.\" That's part of being a news director at a small station, but soon KYUK will try to report the news with a third less staff, because in January Smiley's position will be among those cut. KYUK loses funding and makes cuts KYUK was already navigating a loss in funding  from the state of Alaska  when President Trump  targeted public media and Congress eliminated funding  this summer. It was a big hit to the station's finances because federal funding has been up the bulk of its budget. The federal money essentially paid for employee salaries and benefits. \"It's a little over $1 million that we're receiving each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our salaries and benefits in FY 25 [fiscal year 2025] was also a little over $1 million,\" says Kristin Hall, KYUK's general manager. The station had 10 full- time employees and 13 part-time or on-call workers, says Hall. \"Beginning in January, KYUK will transition to four full-time employees and ten part-time and on-call employees.\" In deciding where to make programming cuts, Hall says preserving Yup'ik language programs was a priority. A daily interview program,  Coffee at KYUK , will lose three episodes a week in English, but keep its weekly Yugtun episode. The station's technical director's hours will be cut from 40 to 10 hours a week, something Hall says she's particularly concerned about because that person trouble shoots engineering problems and helps the station manage power outages. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       To bring in more revenue, Hall says the station is applying for grants, trying to sell more underwriting announcements and will hold two pledge drives each year instead of just one. The station also expects to receive one-time funding through a Trump administration promise to provide  $9.4 million for tribal broadcasting . Hall says the station will re-evaluate in March 2026 whether the workload is sustainable for the smaller staff. So, more cuts could still come. \"My employment here was hanging on by a hair,\" says Sam Berlin, a long-time host of the Yugtun language talk show  Yuk to Yuk . \"But the people, God bless them, they got together and we raised over $100,000 with our fundraiser.\" Just before Typhoon Halong hit the region, KYUK raised the money during its  fall fundraiser . \"It was our most successful we have ever seen in the history of KYUK,\" Hall says. That helps, but doesn't fill the funding gap. Raising money in a region with fewer than 30,000 people and with a poverty rate that's  twice the national average  is difficult. Hall says many people live a subsistence lifestyle, which means they may not have money to give. \"The encouragement that we get from local folks aren't always in dollars,\" Hall says. She says one person baked blueberry muffins to support the fundraiser and someone else dropped off salmon strips. Hall says an elder came to the station, and in an act of generosity, poured out her purse on the break room table. \"And everything that fell out was less than $3. And she said, 'I want you to have it.' And it was literally everything in her purse.\" Hall says the station hopes its funding strategy will be enough to support the smaller team after January. If KYUK doesn't exist, there's no one else doing the station's level of journalism in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. \"In terms of local news and information, and especially local news and information in Yup'ik, No, there is no one else,\" Hall says.

Hundreds are still evacuated, and now they face another loss. One of the few sources for local news and information, public radio and television station KYUK, says it plans to cut its staff and its programming. That's after President Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated money for public media, wiping out much of the station's funding. NPR's Jeff Brady has this story. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: When the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit the village of Kwigillingok on Alaska's rural southwest coast, David Ryan's (ph) house floated away with him and his four children inside. While waiting for rescuers, he talked on the phone with KYUK. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) RYAN DAVID: The flood lifted us up, and I didn't think it was going to happen. And I'm like, I yelled at my kids to get up and group up here on the stairs just in case we tip over. BRADY: The house did not tip over. It hit a bridge and stopped. About four dozen homes floated away like this in the storm, thankfully inland with the storm surge and not out to sea. In this isolated village with no roads to the outside world, all-terrain vehicles are how people get around. In Kwigillingok, KYUK is a crucial source of information, especially as a hotter climate from humans burning fossil fuels makes storms like Halong more intense. Lifelong resident Darrel John says the station's Yup'ik language programs are especially valuable. DARREL JOHN: A lot of great advices we listen to from the elders, any updates from any other communities, you know, what to look out for or any upcoming events. BRADY: Over more than 50 years, KYUK has become a connecting resource for this sparsely populated region, which is about the size of Louisiana. The station broadcasts from a small building at the base of a tall tower in the town of Bethel. Each weekday, as Morning Edition ends, there's local news and, very important in a place where people drive over frozen rivers in the winter, the weather forecast in the Yup'ik language. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Yup'ik). BRADY: KYUK was already navigating funding cuts from the state of Alaska when President Trump targeted public media and Congress eliminated funding this summer. KYUK General Manager Kristin Hall says federal money essentially paid for the staff. KRISTIN HALL, BYLINE: It's a little over $1 million that we were receiving each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our salaries and benefits in FY25 was also a little over $1 million. BRADY: Federal funding has been up to 70% of KYUK's budget. Hall says the station had 10 full-time employees, but after January, that'll be down to four. As the station transitions to more part-time and on-call workers, it's cutting a daily interview program to two days a week and may have to end other programs next year. HALL: Essentially, the news director position is being cut. BRADY: Sage Smiley is currently KYUK's full-time news director. She's also the local high school swim coach and was at a meet in another city when the remnants of Typhoon Halong arrived. SAGE SMILEY, BYLINE: I was working remotely from a minivan with the swim team while the rest of the team was working on the ground here, and we had collaborators in Anchorage who were helping draft scripts and call communities and figure out what was happening. BRADY: In January, Smiley says her hours will be reduced to about five per week, essentially cutting the newsroom staff by a third. The station has prioritized keeping Yup'ik language programs, such as the weekly talk show Yuk to Yuk with longtime host Sam Berlin. SAM BERLIN, BYLINE: My employment here was hanging on by a hair, but the people - God bless them - they got together. And we raised over 100,000 with our fundraiser. BRADY: That helps but doesn't fill the gap. Raising money in a region with fewer than 30,000 people and with a poverty rate that's twice the national average is difficult. The station is applying for grants, trying to sell more underwriting announcements and will hold more pledge drives. The station hopes that will raise enough to keep KYUK on the air with a smaller staff. Jeff Brady, NPR News, Bethel, Alaska.

Just ask Maine \n         By Kevin Miller \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         AUGUSTA, Maine — This week's  vote to end  the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along partisan lines. Yet the bill to reopen the government was reliant upon Democratic lawmakers of both chambers who joined Republicans, exposing rifts within the Democratic Party. That political divide was clearly evident in Maine's congressional delegation — and the  public's reaction to how they voted . \"Well, Angus really hurt us in Maine,\" said Donna Doucette who, like many folks in Maine, refers to Sen. Angus King by his first name. King — an independent who caucuses with Democrats — was among eight minority party senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen government. Doucette was one of about two dozen protesters holding signs along a busy street in Waterville on a recent cold and blustery November afternoon. The protesters, many of whom are part of the local Indivisible chapter, were opposed to the deal  ending the government shutdown . \"I've supported him from the beginning and I think he sold us out. Especially when I'm retired, still dealing with cancer — I don't need that now. Nor does my husband, who is even older than me,\" she said. As part of the deal, Senate Republicans promised a future vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. But critics say they betrayed the Democratic cause by failing to secure an actual extension of the tax credits that roughly 20 million ACA users rely upon to lower their premiums. Without congressional action, the average premium is  expected to more than double  after December 31st. Some protesters brought signs calling King a coward. Cindy Burke said he caved. \"We held out for 40 days, I think, and I just feel that we got nothing from it,\" said Burke. \"And a promise to have a vote on the ACA, I don't believe that is going to happen. I don't trust the Republicans.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A small delegation with a significant split  Maine's four-person congressional delegation is one of the smallest in the country. Yet their  mixed votes on the bill  to reopen the government reflect the national divide over the fraught issue. Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins blamed the shutdown on Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Yet as chairwoman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins  helped broker the compromise  that funds the government through January 30 and fully funds some agencies through September 30. Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, supported extending the ACA subsidies but blasted his party's shutdown strategy. He cast one of his party's six House votes to end the shutdown. His fellow Maine Democrat, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, views the compromise as a \"capitulation,\" particularly after the Democratic victories nationwide during the Nov. 4 election. \"Many of us felt like there was a lot of momentum behind us,\" said Pingree. \"And the Republicans are feeling these concerns. They are losing court battles and they are getting the same calls that we are. We should move them to a decision, not the promise of a vote.\" Angus King said in an interview with Maine Public Radio earlier this week that he's surprised by the  ferocity of the backlash , although he understands the sentiment. \"I understand because millions of people in this country are gravely worried and angry and frankly scared about the future of their country because of what Donald Trump is doing,\" King said. \"I'm with them. I've been to the 'No Kings' rallies here in Maine.\" But King defended his decision, saying Republicans made clear they would not negotiate on the ACA until the government reopened. Government shutdowns rarely secure policy concessions for the minority party. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Although he supports extending the subsidies, King said the shutdown harmed Americans — and empowered Trump. That's why King voted with Republicans more than a dozen times to avoid or end the shutdown. \"And I get it: people want some place to stand up and they felt this was it,\" King said. \"But it's backfiring in a sense that it is hurting a lot of people without getting what we want.\" Independents play a key role in upcoming elections It's unclear how shutdown partisanship will impact next year's elections in Maine — a state where  30 percent of voters  are independents. And Maine could play an outsized role in control of Congress after 2026. Golden isn't seeking reelection in a House district that Trump won twice, giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat. And the shutdown is already popping up in the heated Democratic primary to challenge Collins, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans. Collins has not yet announced that she is running for reelection, although she is aggressively fundraising. \"I want to reiterate my call for Leader Schumer to step down,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, a Marine Corps veteran and oysterman whose anti-establishment message has drawn huge crowds, despite recent controversy over past online comments and a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner has said  he didn't realize the connection  when he received the tattoo as a young infantryman and recently had it covered. Platner denounced the shutdown deal, blaming Schumer — who opposed the deal but couldn't keep his party unified against it. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate. \"The governor has Chuck Schumer's phone number. She should give him a call and have a chat about that.\" For her part, Mills said this week that she strongly disagrees with the deal to end the shutdown. \"I appreciate Senator King's efforts here, but it's not going to work,\" Mills said on MSNBC. \"The mere promise of taking it up, putting it on the calendar, talking about it in December . . . Maine people can't wait.\" Back in Waterville, protest organizer Karen Heck said she's frustrated — with King, with her Democratic Party and with politicians, in general. \"I just think that most people are tired of a government that doesn't work for them,\" Heck said. \"Whether that's a schism in the Democratic Party or not, I think that this old system, the old system is not working for us. And a lot of people are angry about that.\" Heck added that she thinks people will demand a change — possibly starting in next year's primaries. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   This week's vote to end the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along party lines, and it exposed rifts within the Democratic Party.

Here's what you need to know \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The government is back open. It was  the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 43 days . There are lots of questions about what this means, how we got here and where we go from here. Let's answer some: Why did it start? The Democratic base has been urging its leaders to show more fight. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught tremendous blowback in March for doing an about-face and going along with Republicans to keep the government open despite what the left saw as an odious spending bill. When the latest funding fight came up, Schumer this time showed a united front with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Arm in arm, they refused to go along with continuing to fund the government, and made the key issue extending health care subsidies, which, if not extended, would mean tens of millions of Americans would see their health care costs increased. How did it end? It ended without the health care extensions Democrats were fighting for. Eight moderate senators crossed the aisle and indicated Sunday night that they had struck a deal with Senate Republicans to reopen the government. The reason they didn't hold out longer, this group said, was because it was obvious President Trump and congressional Republicans weren't going to negotiate, and too many people were suffering. The Trump administration — correctly — gambled that enough Democrats would not be able to stomach the amount of pain the administration was willing to inflict on the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and more than 3 million federal workers. So what does the bill do? The bill  passed by Congress and signed by Trump  funds the government until Jan. 30 with carveouts for SNAP, benefits targeted at women, infants and children, or WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Congress. Those will all be funded until the end of September 2026. It notably also tries to rectify the firings and loss of pay to federal workers, although it's a leverage point the Trump administration could use again if the government were to shut down again after Jan. 30. There is also money for  increased security  for members of Congress, executive branch officials, judges and Supreme Court justices. Several Republican members were outspoken about this after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. If the government is only funded until Jan. 30, does that mean there could be another shutdown soon? It's possible. It depends on a few things. What lessons do Democrats take out of the shutdown? Does the fire within the base subside some between now and then? And is there an actual vote on health care subsidies? OK, so what about those health care subsidies? It's not clear yet, but the lack of a negotiation on them likely means they will expire unless enough moderate Republicans, feeling pressure in their districts, cross over to strike a deal with Democrat — and Republican leadership, including and especially Trump, go along with it. But that seems highly improbable — and tens of millions of people would see their premiums go up. If that's the case, what was the point of the shutdown? That's a question a lot of people, especially those left of center, are asking. They see what moderate Democrats did as caving to Republicans. The reality is, though, the 8 moderate senators, who caucus with Democrats and took this deal, didn't want to see regular people feel more unnecessary pain — and they saw no hope for Republicans to compromise after what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Democrats did accomplish something in this shutdown, though. They elevated the issue of health care, and if Republicans block the extension of subsidies, then they will likely own increased health care costs in voters' minds. What does this mean for federal workers and flight delays? Government workers will get back to work, and recent mass layoffs are to be reversed. Furloughed workers were missing paychecks. As far as airports, there are already signs of easing, but it will likely be several days or more until everything will get back to normal. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that more air traffic controllers are heading back to work, but in the very short term, flight reductions at some major airports will continue. Were there any surprises? Yes, there were a few. First, there's drama around a provision slipped in the bill that would allow senators to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 each, if they were subject to subpoenas or had their phone records accessed as a result of DOJ's Jan. 6 investigation. House Republicans pledged to pass a resolution repealing that provision, but there's no guarantee of that or that the Senate will go along. There was also a clash about hemp regulation between two Republican senators from the same state. The disagreement between Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul  got pretty heated . The bill also shines a light on  how hundreds of local projects are funded  — from the purchasing of equipment for a college in the Virgin Islands, the establishing of a veterinary doctorate program in Maryland, urban forest conservation in Texas and asbestos abatement in Alaska to funding for local hospitals, rural community facilities, youth centers, fire stations, and so, so much more. It's earmarks — funding not voted on or allocated through the formal appropriations process but tacked on in spending bills — that pay for all of these things. One day, there will be a vet that will say he or she got a degree from the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — and it'll all be because of the funding deal to reopen the government. Ah, democracy. Is there a guarantee on a health care vote? No. The moderate Senate Democrats, who crossed over to open the government, thought so, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said shortly after the deal was reached that he wouldn't commit to a vote. Whether the vote happens or not, if health care subsidies are not extended, it will be because of Republicans — and that will mean they will own higher health care costs heading into an election year. What does this mean for the Epstein files? The end of the shutdown meant the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election in Arizona replacing her late father. That's key because she signed onto a discharge petition trying to compel the Justice Department to release the files associated with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and her support gave a majority to those who want to see them released. Johnson, who is close to Trump, has argued compelling the release is not necessary — though the president has made clear he does not want them released in full and his Justice Department has not taken public steps to do so. Even if it passes, though, it will largely likely be symbolic. The Senate is unlikely to get the required 60 votes. Trump would, of course, like it to fail in the House. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of three Republicans who have also signed the discharge petition, met in the White House Situation Room, apparently about Epstein. Boebert did not remove her name even after the meeting. The day the shutdown ended, more investigative materials were released from the House Oversight Committee, including a leak from committee Democrats pointing specifically to emails from Epstein's estate, showing Epstein implying that Trump knew about the girls. Any day Trump is talking about Epstein is not a good day for the White House. Who winds up with the political advantage out of the shutdown? Democrats really upset their base — again. Progressives continue to feel like they get rolled by party leaders. At the end of the day, though, Democrats are likely the ones who got the most out of the shutdown and will have  the advantage in the midterm elections . Consider that Democrats are coming off huge wins across the country earlier this month in the off-year elections. The central issue in those elections was affordability. And through the shutdown, they elevated the issue of health care. The party and its candidates will likely be able to campaign on both of those issues next year, and with Republicans in charge, that will help Democrats — if they can mend fences with their base, that is. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608969","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:09:00-05:00","title":"She criticized President Trump during the shutdown.

Now she's been put on leave \n         By Andrea Hsu \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 2:09 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institutes of Health, says she has been put on paid leave following the end of the government shutdown. \"I was not given a reason for being put on leave, but I strongly suspect it is because I have been speaking up in my personal capacity about the harms that I have been witnessing inside the National Institutes of Health,\" she said in  a video posted to TikTok . The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\" She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize  a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists , pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk. In  an interview with NPR in early October , Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes. \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\" Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\" Agriculture Department employee also on leave On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave. Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about food assistance programs in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.  \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\" MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity. A right to speak on matters of public concern Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest. She points to a  1968 Supreme Court decision  that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights. \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\" Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out. \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. And I was determined not to do that.\" NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5605831","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"12:36:00.000-05:00","title":"Chile's election sets up a stark left–right showdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chile’s 2025 general election marks a pivotal moment in the nation’s political history, with a stark ideological divide between left-wing and far-right candidates.

   By John Bartlett \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 12:36 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         SANTIAGO, Chile — This Sunday, Chileans head to the polls in a general election to vote for a new president, Senate and Congress. But four years after voting for leftwing former student leader  Gabriel Boric  to become the country's youngest ever president with a mandate to expand the welfare state in Chile, this race looks radically different. Security, immigration and unemployment are top of the agenda for voters. Three right-wing candidates are vying to join Communist Party politician Jeannette Jara, 51, the current frontrunner according to polls, in a likely runoff election to be held next month. Jara , who served as labour minister in Boric's government and is a former student and union leader, is promising to gradually introduce a minimum income of $780 per month, as well as cash transfers to workers, and subsidies for small businesses. She closed her campaign on Wednesday evening in an open square in a southern district of the capital, Santiago, where supermarket cashier Rosa Rivera watched Jara deliver her closing remarks alongside her husband from the back of the crowd. \"She doesn't promise things she can't achieve, which I think is a very responsible approach,\" she said. \"I believe she would be a good president for Chile.\" In the evening sunshine across town, 20-year-old medical student Alanis Ramírez explained why her vote was going to far-right Catholic father of nine  José Antonio Kast , before ducking into a cavernous concert venue to hear her candidate speak one final time before Sunday's vote. \"He knows what our country needs, and he has the experience to deliver it,\" she said. \"Chile needs an iron fist, because criminals have it too easy – I can't even go out in the street in my neighbourhood anymore because it's too dangerous.\" Inside the building, music blared and a handful of young people jumped up and down excitedly at the request of a DJ playing reggaeton, while lights strafed the crowd as it built up. When Kast finally spoke to the packed arena, his plans to tackle illegal migration, delivered to a backdrop of red, white and blue, the colours of Chile's flag, provided a spectacle with a distinctly Trumpian ring. Kast's hardline security and immigration policies have seen him praise El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, who has cracked down on gang violence in the Central American nation, and paint his potential administration as an \"emergency\" government. He is proposing to criminalize irregular migration, dig border ditches and build walls, and construct new high-security jails. President Boric has been lambasted by Chile's right wing, who blame his administration for disregarding security, which is perceived to have skyrocketed under his leadership. In October, 63% of Chilean respondents to an Ipsos survey said that their most pressing concern was crime – more even than respondents in Mexico or Colombia. But while homicides have dropped and Chile remains one of the safest countries in Latin America, violent crime rates have spiked for some specific offences such as kidnappings. Outflanking Kast even further to the right is 49-year-old YouTuber-turned libertarian congressman,  Johannes Kaiser , who is running for the presidency for the first time. At his own campaign closing event on Wednesday, a baying crowd was whipped up by Kaiser's vitriolic anti-communism and attacks on progressive values. In the crowd, some souvenir sellers sold pin badges with anti-communist messages and even mock ID cards with dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet's image. He has said that if elected, he would close the border with Bolivia to halt illegal migration, reduce the number of ministries from 25 to nine, deport undocumented migrants and their children, and withdraw Chile from international climate treaties and the regional human rights court. In 2021 as a congressman-elect, Kaiser questioned whether women should have the right to vote, and has consistently attacked what he refers to as \"gender ideology.\" A fourth rightwing candidate,  Evelyn Matthei , a long-term fixture on the traditional right wing of Chilean politics, has fallen precipitously in the polls as a more moderate alternative for the presidency. Matthei, like Kast and Kaiser, is of German descent. She even thanked Kaiser in German at the final televised debate a week before the election. Voting is mandatory in this election, meaning turnout will be significantly higher than in 2021. If no presidential candidate secures an absolute majority on Sunday, as is expected, the two leading contenders will head to a runoff on Dec. 14th. The new president will take office on March 11. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   On Sunday, Chileans will cast their ballots in the first round of a general election for president and Congress. It's a campaign that highlights the country's deep political polarization, and the alternatives in the presidential race could hardly be starker, as John Bartlett reports from the capital, Santiago. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting in non-English language). JOHN BARTLETT: In Chile right now, it feels like you can't turn a corner without running into a rally or campaign event. (CHEERING) BARTLETT: Eight presidential candidates, ranging from the far left to far right, are vying to lead Chile into a new era. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: Four years after winning on a social justice agenda, President Gabriel Boric is leaving office. But now, public security has become the focus of the campaigns. Leading the polls in this first round of voting is Jeannette Jara, a Communist Party politician and former Boric minister. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEANNETTE JARA: Viva Chile. (CHEERING) BARTLETT: Her program promises a minimum income of around $780 per month, cash transfers to workers and subsidies for small businesses. FLORENCIA VARAS: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: \"I feel like Jara is the candidate who is closest to the reality in Chile,\" Florencia Varas, a 23-year-old theater student, told me in the square in Maipu, a southern Santiago district. VARAS: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: \"Obviously, security is important, but I don't think everything they're saying is real. Chile is not a dangerous place.\" UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). (CHEERING) BARTLETT: But not everyone sees it that way. On the right, concerns over crime and migration are driving a surge that could shape December's runoff, with many voters likely uniting behind ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BARTLETT: Kast, the Catholic father of nine, was roundly defeated by Boric in 2021's presidential election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSE ANTONIO KAST: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: At his campaign's closing rally in a cavernous concert venue in Santiago, thousands wave red, white and blue Chilean flags, and music blared as Kast outlined his plans for building hundreds of miles of border walls - a spectacle that had a distinctly Trumpean (ph) ring. ROBERTO WEBER: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: Roberto Weber helped cofound Kast's Republican Party in 2017. He believes Chile's economy, security and health care can only be saved by Kast. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING) BARTLETT: The greatest challenge to Kast is coming from even further to the right. Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian YouTuber known for mocking the victims of Chile's dictatorship and questioning women's right to vote, has gained a following that could shape the final round of the campaign in December. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: At Kaiser's closing rally, supporters wrapped in Chile flags sported Make Chile Great Again caps... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHANNES KAISER: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: ...And others wore vicious anti-communist slogans on T-shirts and pins, while vendors sold mock ID cards featuring the image of Chile's former dictator, General Augusto Pinochet. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: One tattooed 26-year-old student, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution from the left, proudly explained that her anti-communist T-shirt, printed with the date of General Pinochet's coup d'etat, was a celebration of the freedom that his 17-year dictatorship brought Chile. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: As the national anthem struck up behind us, she explained that she finds Kaiser the most sensible and straight talking of the candidates. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Singing in Spanish). BARTLETT: If no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote to win outright on Sunday, as is expected, a runoff will be held on the 14 of December, and the most likely outcome is that Chileans will be left with a stark choice between the Communist Party's Jara and one of her two far-right rivals. Whatever the result on Sunday, a choice between two drastically different visions for the future will face Chileans in the second round.

Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years, didn't explain what supposed crimes he wanted the Justice Department to investigate. None of the men he mentioned in a social media post demanding the probe has been accused of sexual misconduct by any of Epstein's victims. Hours before Bondi's announcement, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would ask her, the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman. Trump, calling the matter \"the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans,\" said the investigation should also include financial giant JPMorgan Chase, which provided banking services to Epstein, and \"many other people and institutions.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" the Republican president wrote, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian interference in Trump's 2016 election victory over Bill Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Asked later Friday whether he should be ordering up such investigations, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: \"I'm the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I'm allowed to do it.\" In a July memo regarding the Epstein investigation, the FBI said, \"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" The president's demand for an investigation — and Bondi's quick acquiescence — is the latest example of the erosion of the Justice Department's traditional independence from the White House since Trump took office. It is also an extraordinary attempt at deflection. For decades, Trump himself has been scrutinized for his closeness to Epstein — though like the people he now wants investigated, he has not been accused of sexual misconduct by Epstein's victims. None of Trump's proposed targets were accused of sex crimes A JPMorgan Chase spokesperson, Patricia Wexler, said the company regretted associating with Epstein \"but did not help him commit his heinous acts.\" \"The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,\" she said. The company agreed previously to pay millions of dollars to Epstein's victims, who had sued arguing that the bank ignored red flags about criminal activity. Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein's private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. He also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims. Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X Friday: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.\" Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, but was spared a long jail term when the U.S. attorney in Florida agreed not to prosecute him over allegations that he had paid many other children for sexual acts. After serving about a year in jail and a work release program, Epstein resumed his business and social life until federal prosecutors in New York revived the case in 2019. Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Summers and Hoffman had nothing to do with either case, but both were friendly with Epstein and exchanged emails with him. Those messages were among the documents released this week, along with other correspondence Epstein had with friends and business associates in the years before his death. Nothing in the messages suggested any wrongdoing on the men's part, other than associating with someone who had been accused of sex crimes against children. Summers, who served in Clinton's cabinet and is a former Harvard University president, previously said in a statement that he has \"great regrets in my life\" and that \"my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.\" On social media Friday night, Hoffman called for Trump to release all the Epstein files, saying they will show that \"the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander.\" He added, \"I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT.\" Hoffman bankrolled writer E. Jean Carroll's sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit against Trump. After Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in 2019, Hoffman said he'd only had a few interactions with Epstein, all related to his fundraising for MIT's Media Lab. He nevertheless apologized, saying that \"by agreeing to participate in any fundraising activity where Epstein was present, I helped to repair his reputation and perpetuate injustice.\" Bondi, in her post, praised Clayton as \"one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country\" and said the Justice Department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\" Trump called Clayton \"a great man, a great attorney,\" though he said Bondi chose him for the job. Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term, took over in April as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York — the same office that indicted Epstein and won a sex trafficking conviction against Epstein's longtime confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2021. Trump changes course on Epstein files Trump suggested while campaigning last year that he'd seek to open up the government's case files on Epstein, but changed course in recent months, blaming Democrats and painting the matter as a \"hoax\" amid questions about what knowledge he may have had about Epstein's yearslong exploitation of underage girls. On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three Epstein email exchanges that referenced Trump, including one from 2019 in which Epstein said the president \"knew about the girls\" and asked Maxwell to stop. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of having \"selectively leaked emails\" to smear Trump. Soon after, Republicans on the committee disclosed a far bigger trove of Epstein's email correspondence, including messages he sent to longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon and to Britain's former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Andrew settled a lawsuit out of court with one of Epstein's victims, who said she had been paid to have sex with the prince. The House is speeding toward a vote next week to force the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein. \"I don't care about it, release or not,\" Trump said Friday. \"If you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he added, naming Clinton and Hoffman. Still, he said: \"This is a Democrat hoax. And a couple, a few Republicans have gone along with it because they're weak and ineffective.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609835","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:27:00-05:00","title":"Pope Leo returns 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Vatican, under Pope Leo XIV, returned 62 Indigenous artifacts to Canadian Indigenous communities as a historic act of reconciliation, following decades of colonial-era cultural suppression and forced assimilation policies.

Canada \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 8:27 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         VATICAN CITY — The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada, a historic restitution that is part of the Catholic Church's reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is expected to return them to individual Indigenous communities. A joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church described the pieces as a \"gift\" and a \"concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\" The items were part of the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens. The Vatican insists the items were \"gifts\" to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church's global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized. But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government's forced assimilation policy of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \"cultural genocide.\" Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections. Negotiations accelerate on returning items Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in running Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including the Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned. Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \"In the case where you can return things, where it's necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\" The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome as a highlight of that Jubilee. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\" said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church. It added that the Canadian Catholic hierarchy committed to ensuring that the artifacts are \"properly safeguarded, respected and preserved.\" Officials had previously said the Canadian bishops would receive the artifacts with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities themselves. The items are expected to be taken first to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. There, experts and Indigenous groups will try to identify where the items originated, down to the specific community, and what should be done with them, officials said previously. A process of reckoning with abuses The Canadian ambassador to the Holy See, Joyce Napier, said the return had been a key priority for the Canadian government, something the embassy has been working on for years with the Holy See, Canadian church and Indigenous communities. \"This is historic, something Indigenous communities have been asking for,\" she told The Associated Press. \"Today's announcement is a significant step towards reconciliation.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As part of its broader reckoning with the Catholic Church's colonial past, the Vatican in 2023 formally repudiated the \"Doctrine of Discovery,\" the theories backed by 15th-century \"papal bulls\" that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands that form the basis of some property laws today. The statement marked a historic recognition of the Vatican's own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers, even though it didn't address Indigenous demands that the Vatican formally rescind the papal bulls themselves. The Vatican on Saturday cited the 2023 repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery in its statement, saying Leo's return of the artifacts concludes the \"journey\" initiated by Francis. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97936","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:22:00-05:00","title":"Trump scraps tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruit in a push to lower prices","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced a significant rollback of U.S. tariffs on key food commodities including beef, coffee, tropical fruits, tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, and certain fertilizers, in response to mounting public and political pressure over high consumer prices and inflation.

\n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 9:22 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue, resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,\" Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, \"I say they may, in some cases\" have that effect. \"But to a large extent they've been borne by other countries,\" the president added. Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump's pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated, further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren't a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday's move as an acknowledgement that Trump's policies were hurting American pocketbooks. \"President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,\" Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. \"After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters' fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a 'pivot to affordability.'\" Grocery bill worries Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don't increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, had been a factor. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren't produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump's move to provide \"swift tariff relief,\" noting that import U.S. taxes \"are an important factor\" in a \"complex mix\" of supply chain issues. \"President Trump's proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,\" the association said in a statement. In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he'd since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Indeed, Friday's announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. \"Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,\" the president said then. \"We're going to have some coffee come in.\" Tariff checks? Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, \"Sometime during the year.\" Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. \"This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,\" Trump said. \"Everybody but the rich will get this. That's not made up. That's real money. That comes from other countries.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97954","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-05:00","title":"Trump cuts ties with Marjorie Taylor Greene, once among his top MAGA-world defenders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has publicly ended his close relationship with Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former cornerstone of the MAGA movement, by calling her 'Wacky Marjorie' and stating he would endorse a challenger against her in the upcoming midterms.

   Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 12:06 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Donald Trump has publicly called it quits with one of his most stalwart MAGA-world supporters, calling Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The dismissal of Greene — once the epitome of \"Make America Great Again,\" sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union address and acting as a go-between for Trump and other Capitol Hill Republicans — appeared to be the final break in a dispute simmering for months, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term U.S. House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies. Accusing the Georgia Republican of going \"Far Left,\" Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\" In a response on X, Greene wrote Friday that Trump had \"attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said \"is what sent him over the edge.\" Greene called it \"astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" referencing next week's U.S. House vote over releasing the Epstein files. Writing that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\" Trump's post seemingly tied a bow of finality to fissures that widened following this month's off-cycle elections, in which voters in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races flocked to Democrats in large part over concerns about the cost of living. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last week, Greene told NBC News that \"watching the foreign leaders come to the White House through a revolving door is not helping Americans,\" saying that Trump needs to focus on high prices at home rather than his recent emphasis on foreign affairs. Trump responded by saying that Greene had \"lost her way.\" Asked about Greene's comments earlier Friday as he flew from Washington to Florida, Trump reiterated that he felt \"something happened to her over the last month or two,\" saying that, if he hadn't gone to China to meet leader Xi Jinping, there would have been negative ramifications for jobs in Georgia and elsewhere because China would have kept its curbs on magnet exports. Saying that people have been calling him, wanting to challenge Greene, Trump added, \"She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.\" Greene's discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn't run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn't win. In June, she publicly sided with Tucker Carlson after Trump called the commentator \"kooky\" in a schism that emerged between MAGA and national security hardliners over possible U.S. efforts at regime change in Iran. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That only intensified in July, when Greene said she wouldn't run for governor. Then, she attacked a political \"good ole boy\" system, alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state. Greene embarked on a charm offensive in recent weeks, with interviews and appearances in media aimed at people who aren't hardcore Trump supporters. Asked on comedian Tim Dillon's podcast if she wanted to run for president in 2028, Greene said in October, \"I hate politics so much\" and just wanted \"to fix problems\" — but didn't give a definitive answer. That climaxed with an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show \"Real Time,\" followed days later by a Nov. 4 appearance on ABC's \"The View.\" Some observers began pronouncing Greene as reasonable as she trashed Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana for not calling Republicans back to Washington and coming up with a health care plan. \"I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin. \"Maybe you should become a Democrat, Marjorie,\" said co-host Joy Behar. \"I'm not a Democrat,\" Greene replied. \"I think both parties have failed.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609897","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"14:11:00Z","title":"Americana troubadour Todd Snider, alt-country singer-songwriter, dies at 59","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Todd Snider, a celebrated American singer-songwriter known for his roots music and cosmic, humorous songwriting, died at 59.

Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 2:11 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NASHVILLE, Tenn. —  Todd Snider , a singer whose thoughtfully freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure in American roots music, has died. He was 59. His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday. \"Where do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\" the statement read. \"Always creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\" Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team. But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the  Salt Lake Tribune  reported. The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \"High, Lonesome and Then Some,\" which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a  \"singer-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\"  and a  \"stoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\" He modeled himself on — and at times met and was mentored by — artists like  Kris Kristofferson ,  Guy Clark  and  John Prine . His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song  with Loretta Lynn  that appeared on her 2016 album, \"Full Circle.\" \"He relayed so much tenderness and sensitivity through his songs, and showed many of us how to look at the world through a different lens,\" the Saturday statement from his label read. \"He got up every morning and started writing, always working towards finding his place among the songwriting giants that sat on his record shelves, those same giants who let him into their lives and took him under their wings, who he studied relentlessly.\" Snider would do his best-known and most acclaimed work for Prine's independent label Oh Boy in the early 2000s. It included the albums \"New Connection,\" \"Near Truths and Hotel Rooms\" and \"East Nashville Skyline,\" a 2004 collection that's considered by many to be his best. Those albums yielded his best known songs, \"I Can't Complain,\" \"Beer Run\" and \"Alright Guy.\" Snider was born and raised in Oregon before settling and making his musical chops in San Marcos, Texas. He eventually made his way to Nashville, and was dubbed by some the unofficial \"mayor of East Nashville,\" assuming the title from a friend memorialized thusly in his \"Train Song.\" In 2021, Snider said a tornado that ripped through the neighborhood home to a vibrant arts scene severely damaged his house. Snider had an early fan  in Jimmy Buffett , who signed the young artist to his record label, Margaritaville, which released his first two albums, 1994's \"Songs for the Daily Planet\" and 1996's \"Step Right Up.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/portland-oregon-national-guard-trial-f8b20a8425792b9e0e8a07c47ee89223","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"23:43:40+00:00","title":"Trump Administration Appeals Ruling Blocking National Guard Deployment in Portland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s administration attempted to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal personnel amid protests at an ICE building.

(AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday appealed a ruling from a federal judge in Oregon that barred it from deploying the National Guard to Portland. The ruling last week from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. The city and state filed the lawsuit in September to block the deployment. In a 106-page opinion , Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces. The administration criticized the decision and said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump has described as “war ravaged.” “The district court’s ruling made it clear that this administration must be accountable to the truth and to the rule of law,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an emailed statement Friday in response to the administration’s appeal. “We will keep defending Oregon values and standing up for our state’s authority to make decisions grounded in evidence and common sense.” Related Stories Monday and Bethune score in Spirit’s 2-0 win over Thorns to reach NWSL championship 1 MIN READ Americana troubadour Todd Snider, alt-country singer-songwriter, dies at 59 2 MIN READ Dante Moore throws for 2 touchdowns and No. 7 Oregon routs Minnesota 42-13 3 MIN READ Immergut issued two temporary restraining orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial.

a semitrailer truck or bus have been put on hold by a federal appeals court. The court in the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in September a month after a truck driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people can’t be enforced right now. The court said the federal government didn’t follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to “articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety.” The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5% of all commercial driver’s licenses but only about 0.2% of all fatal crashes, the court said. Duffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state’s records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules — not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on “This is not a ruling on the merits of the case. Secretary Duffy will continue working to keep unqualified, foreign drivers off American roads,” a Transportation Department spokesman said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office didn’t respond immediately Friday to questions about the ruling. Newsom’s office has said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when issuing these licenses to noncitizens. Duffy has said the Florida crash, along with fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year, highlighted questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only added to the concerns. The driver in the Florida crash, Harjinder Singh, appeared before a judge in St. Lucie County, Florida, on Thursday, where his attorneys asked to continue his court proceedings into January as they prepare for trial. Singh has pleaded not guilty to three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter. The new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Trucking trade groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association have supported the new rule. There is a bill in Congress that would enshrine the new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses in law. “For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,” said Todd Spencer, the trucking association’s president. Duffy has said that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy has revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he said earlier this week that he may take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. ___ Associated Press writer Kate Payne contributed to this report from Tallahassee, Florida."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5553561","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:58:00-05:00","title":"The Trump Administration Plans Major Shift Away from Long-Term Housing for Homelessness","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is undergoing a major policy shift in homelessness funding, moving away from long-term permanent housing (the 'Housing First' model) toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment.

major shift away from long-term housing for homelessness \n         By Jennifer Ludden \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 12:58 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is upending its homelessness policy, with deep cuts to funding for long-term housing. Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said  the new policies  will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing  Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that. In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups. The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled. \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement. The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments. \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement. The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets. But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels. Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an  executive order he signed in July , which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction. \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer. \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own. There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help. \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles. For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   In a major shift, the Trump administration is moving away from long-term housing for homelessness. Instead, it will ramp up funding for transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. Critics warn that this could push many people back on the streets. NPR's Jennifer Ludden has been covering this and joins us now. Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: OK, so we have been hearing President Trump weigh in a lot on homelessness this year. Can you just tell us more about what this change would mean exactly? LUDDEN: Yeah, this does reflect an executive order President Trump signed this summer, but it goes a lot further. It's about a dramatic shift in how to spend nearly $4 billion in homelessness funding. That's an overall amount that is up from last year. The federal housing agency HUD says the idea is to promote self-sufficiency and get at root causes of homelessness, which it says are specifically addiction and mental illness, very common among those living outside. Now, the changes are a rebuke to longstanding federal policy. It's called Housing First. And under that, the vast majority of this funding has long gone to permanent housing that offers people treatment, but it doesn't require it. There's been a real backlash building as homelessness has spiked to record highs, according to annual federal accounts. I spoke with Stephen Eide who's with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. He's argued for a long time that these permanent housing projects are not the answer. STEPHEN EIDE: It turned out that the units were so expensive. They cost hundreds of thousands of dollars individually, and they took years and years to bring online. And so it was just oversold. LUDDEN: Now, Eide says with this change, it will be quicker and cheaper to ramp up shorter-term transitional housing, and that with mandated treatment, many could become self-sufficient. CHANG: But this is a pretty major overhaul, right? Like, what do advocacy groups who work on homelessness say about this idea? LUDDEN: They largely do not agree at all. I spoke with Ann Oliva. She heads the National Alliance to End Homelessness, and she used to manage HUD's homelessness programs. She says people in the agency's permanent housing need that help, and they need it long term. And her group and others calculate that shifting most money away from these kind of programs could lead as many as 170,000 people to lose housing all over again. ANN OLIVA: Those are people who have overcome homelessness, people who are seniors, who have disabling conditions. It's going to disadvantage those folks, but it also disadvantages communities really significantly because they are being expected to make massive, massive changes in a very short period of time. LUDDEN: And what she means there is these changes are part of a notice to apply for funding, and it's coming much later in the year than usual. Now, some programs are actually slated to run out of money before this new funding would start up. CHANG: Whoa. OK, so then what happens next at this point? LUDDEN: I think next, it is a big scramble, you know, for applying for this funding and also figuring out who can apply to these new qualifications. Advocates say you can't just easily switch from Housing First to transitional, and in many cases, that's just not realistic. Also, the agency will now favor places and programs that comply with the Trump administration's policy agenda, like the president's rollback of DEI and push for homeless camping bans. And finally, in the past, a lot of this funding has basically rolled over to existing projects. But now HUD says only 30% of grants will be automatically renewed. It wants the process to be more competitive with new players at the table. So that's another way that programs who are now housing formerly homeless people could suddenly lose their funding in coming months. CHANG: That is NPR's Jennifer Ludden. Thank you, Jennifer. LUDDEN: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608107","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-11:30","title":"Sirāt is a desert survival story — and one of the year's most gripping films","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sirāt, a 2025 film directed by Spanish filmmaker Oliver Laxe, follows a father named Luis, played by Sergi López, as he searches for his missing daughter, Mar, in a post-apocalyptic rave party in southern Morocco.

Department posted pardons online bearing identical copies of President Donald Trump’s signature before quietly correcting them this week after what the agency called a “technical error.” The replacements came after online commenters seized on striking similarities in the president’s signature across a series of pardons dated Nov. 7, including those granted to former New York Mets player Darryl Strawberry , former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon. In fact, the signatures on several pardons initially uploaded to the Justice Department’s website were identical, two forensic document experts confirmed to The Associated Press. Within hours of the online speculation, the administration replaced copies of the pardons with new ones that did not feature identical signatures. It insisted Trump, who mercilessly mocked his predecessor’s use of an autopen, had originally signed all the Nov. 7 pardons himself and blamed “technical” and staffing issues for the error, which has no bearing on the validity of the clemency actions. The questions about Trump’s signature come amid a new flurry of clemency and weeks after the president claimed to not even know Changpeng Zhao, a crypto billionaire he pardoned last month. He said in an interview with 60 Minutes that the case had been “a Biden witch hunt.” Related Stories Voters in Virginia and New Jersey send a message: It’s Trump’s economy now 5 MIN READ Trump, like Biden before him, finds there’s no quick fix on inflation 6 MIN READ What to know about the 2020 Georgia election case and its new prosecutor 4 MIN READ “A basic axiom of handwriting identification science is that no two signatures are going to bear the exact same design features in every aspect,” said Tom Vastrick, a Florida-based handwriting expert who is president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners. “It’s very straightforward,” said Vastrick, who compared the apparently identical images, now only visible through the online Internet Archive, with the replacements at AP’s request. Chad Gilmartin, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the “website was updated after a technical error where one of the signatures President Trump personally signed was mistakenly uploaded multiple times due to staffing issues caused by the Democrat shutdown.” “There is no story here other than the fact that President Trump signed seven pardons by hand and DOJ posted those same seven pardons with seven unique signatures to our website,” Gilmartin said in a statement to AP, referring to the latest wave of clemency Trump has granted in recent weeks. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email that Trump “signed each one of these pardons by hand as he does with all pardons.” “The media should spend their time investigating Joe Biden’s countless auto penned pardons, not covering a non-story,” she wrote. Trump has been an outspoken critic of Biden’s use of the autopen to conduct executive business, going as far as to display a picture of one such device in place of a portrait of his predecessor in a new “Presidential Walk of Fame” he created along the West Wing colonnade. His Republican allies in Congress last month released a blistering critique of Biden’s alleged “diminished faculties” and mental state during his term that ranked the Democrat’s use of the autopen among “the greatest scandals in U.S. history.” The Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden’s actions in office and sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a full investigation. “Senior White House officials did not know who operated the autopen and its use was not sufficiently controlled or documented to prevent abuse,” the House Oversight Committee found. “The Committee deems void all executive actions signed by the autopen without proper, corresponding, contemporaneous, written approval traceable to the president’s own consent.” On Friday, Republicans who control the committee released a statement that characterized Trump’s potential use of an electronic signature as legitimate, which it distinguished from Biden’s. But Rep. Dave Min, a California Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, seized on the apparent similarities in the initial version of the pardons and called for an investigation of the matter, deploying the Republican arguments against Biden in a statement to AP that “we need to better understand who is actually in charge of the White House, because Trump seems to be slipping.” Regardless, legal experts say the use of an autopen has no bearing on the validity of the pardons. “The key to pardon validity is whether the president intended to grant the pardon,” said Frank Bowman, a legal historian and professor emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law who is writing a book on pardons. “Any re-signing is an obvious, and rather silly, effort to avoid comparison to Biden.” Much of Trump’s mercy has gone to political allies , campaign donors and fraudsters who claimed they were victims of a “weaponized” Justice Department. Trump has largely cast aside a process that historically has been overseen by nonpolitical personnel at the Justice Department. Casada, a disgraced former Republican speaker of the Tennessee House, was sentenced in September to three years in prison. He was convicted of working with a former legislative aide to win taxpayer-funded mail business from state lawmakers who previously drove Casada from office amid a sexting scandal. Strawberry was convicted in the 1990s of tax evasion and drug charges. Trump cited the 1983 National League Rookie of the Year’s post-career embrace of his Christian faith and longtime sobriety when pardoning him. McMahon, a former New York City police sergeant, was sentenced this spring to 18 months in prison for his role in what a federal judge called “a campaign of transnational repression.” He was convicted of acting as a foreign agent for China after he tried to scare an ex-official into going back to his homeland. McMahon’s defense attorney, Lawrence Lustberg, said he was not aware the pardon documents had been replaced until he was contacted Friday by an AP reporter. “It is and has always been our understanding that President Trump granted Mr. McMahon his pardon,” Lustberg wrote in an email. ___ Mustian reported from Natchitoches, Louisiana.

It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina’s two U.S. senators are Republican and President Donald Trump won the state all three times that he’s run for office.

But the Trump administration has used the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train as evidence that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with murder. There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws. How have locals reacted? Critics have described the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They’re also informing immigrants of their rights. “We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said. Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.” The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in operations by Customs and Border Protection. Is the National Guard involved? There is no sign that the National Guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation have urged Democratic Gov.

Nvidia, which has become the poster child of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, began the day with a loss of 3.4%. It then stormed back to a rise of 1.8% and yanked the market in its wake. Critics have been warning that the U.S. stock market could be primed for a drop because of how high prices have shot since April, leaving them looking too expensive. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania. Nvidia’s stock has more than doubled in four of the last five years, for example, and the chip company is still up more than 40% for this year so far. AP AUDIO: Wall Street erases a big early loss as Nvidia and bitcoin swing Nvidia and other Big Tech companies are lifting Wall Street. We hear more from AP business correspondent Seth Sutel.

Outside of tech, Walmart edged down 0.1% after saying CEO Doug McMillon will retire in January in a surprise move. It had been down as much as 3.6% in the morning. McMillon helped the retailer embrace technology more. All told, the S&P 500 fell 3.38 points to 6,734.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 309.74 to 47,147.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 30.23 to 22,900.59. One way companies can tamp down criticism about too-high stock prices is to deliver solid growth in profits. That’s raising the stakes for Nvidia’s profit report coming Wednesday, when it will say how much it earned during the summer.

That would have a big effect on the market because Nvidia has grown to become Wall Street’s largest stock by value. That gives Nvidia’s stock movements a bigger effect on the S&P 500 than any other’s, and it can almost single-handedly steer the index’s direction on any given day. Another way for stock prices broadly to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying less in interest can make investors willing to pay higher prices for stocks and other kinds of investments. Treasury yields had been falling for most of this year on expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut its main interest rate several times. And the Fed has indeed cut twice already in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market . But questions are rising about whether a third cut will actually come after the Fed’s next meeting in December, something that traders had earlier seen as very likely. The downside of lower interest rates is that they can make inflation worse, and inflation has stubbornly remained above the Fed’s 2% target. Fed officials have pointed to the U.S. government’s shutdown , which delayed the release of updates on the job market and other signals about the economy. With less information and less certainty about how things are going, some Fed officials have suggested it may be better just to wait in December to get more clarity. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.14% from 4.11% late Thursday. Specialist Anthony Matesic works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Nov. 14, 2025.

It fell below $95,000, back to where it was in May. It had been near $125,000 only in October. The price of gold, meanwhile, sank 2.4%. It shot to records throughout the year as investors looked for something that could protect from high inflation and big debt loads built by the U.S. and other governments worldwide. But interest rates staying higher can hurt gold, which pays its investors nothing in interest or dividends. In stock markets abroad, indexes dropped across Europe and Asia.

adaptation. George Clooney plays a charming Hollywood star in Jay Kelly, while a warm, funny and goosebump-raising documentary streams on Apple TV. Here's what to watch. Now You See Me, Now You Don't In theaters Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The cast keeps expanding in this magic-centric rob-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor heist franchise, as if the writers saw  Ocean's Eleven  through  Thirteen  and thought, \"we could do that.\" New kids Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt join original Horsemen (and hangers-on) Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and Isla Fisher in pursuit of a priceless diamond held by a money-laundering arms dealer (Rosamund Pike). That fits the aesthetic of the first two  Now You See Me' s (shouldn't this one really be called  Now You Three Me ?) — but where the earlier films seemed to want you to believe the on-screen magicians were pulling off their tricks, this one mostly settles for CGI and cinematic trickery, so that even card tricks fall slightly flat. Eisenberg's prickly snark is still fun, but with the tricks getting less convincing and the scripts more exhausting, it might be time for this franchise to go up in a puff of smoke.  — Bob Mondello  The Running Man  In theaters Friday  This trailer includes instances of vulgar language.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       One tricky thing about writing dystopian fiction with staying power is that the future eventually catches up with you. Stephen King's 1982 novel  The Running Man  takes place in 2025. In his vision of, well, now, there is widespread poverty, rule by giant corporations, and exploitative entertainment that takes advantage of people who are suffering and tries to force ordinary people to despise each other. There is environmental destruction, mass surveillance, and even the resurgence of polio. Just imagine. The story follows a man named Ben Richards, who tries to provide for his family and his sick kid by going on a game show also called  The Running Man . On the show, he has to survive on the streets for 30 days while professional assassins pursue him. If he makes it, he wins a billion dollars. But, of course, nobody has ever survived. In the new adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright, Richards (played by Glen Powell) auditions for the game shows run by the megacorporation known as The Network because his daughter has the flu, and Richards and his wife can't afford a doctor for her without a big prize. The biggest problem with this adaptation is that if you read the book, you probably know there are a couple of things about the ending that a major studio movie released in 2025 is unlikely to replicate. As an action movie that hits the gas, gets the running man running, and doesn't let up, it works quite well, and it's a lot of fun. But some of King's sharper-elbowed commentary about what it might take to escape this kind of oppressive society is blunted a bit, making it a less effective critique of its world than the book was.  — Linda Holmes  Jay Kelly In limited theaters Friday; on Netflix Dec. 5 \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Hollywood star Jay Kelly — handsome, affable, debonaire, sixty-something … in short, George Clooney — reconsiders his life choices on a trip to Tuscany in Noah Baumbach's bland mid-life crisis dramedy. Estranged from one daughter (Riley Keough), and distressed by the growing distance of another (Grace Edwards) who's off on a trip to Europe before college, he's feeling alone in a crowd of paid companions, including his faithful manager (Adam Sandler, excellent) and publicist (Laura Dern, whose talents are mostly wasted). After a public altercation with a college buddy, he opts to avoid the PR blowup and possibly find some catch-up time with his daughter by taking an impromptu trip to Italy for a career tribute he'd previously turned down.  Minor misadventures ensue — a train trip punctuated by a purse snatching incident, a reunion with his coarse dad (Stacy Keach), a fight with his increasingly put-upon manager. Not sure I was feeling anyone's pain about the loneliness of stardom, the heartbreak of success, the … whatever the hell else this was about. Baumbach has wandered into the territory of  8½  and  Stardust Memories  and he gets a bit lost in the woods, but Clooney's magnetism goes a decent way to making things palatable, the cinematography is pretty and Sandler dominates whenever he's on screen.  — Bob Mondello  The Things You Kill In limited theaters Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Iranian-Canadian director Alireza Khatami's Turkish-language thriller follows Ali, a university professor, as his life unravels. His mother's sick, his father's a bully, his wife wants a child (he hasn't told her his sperm count is low), and his only safe place is an arid farm (\"garden\") to which he retreats whenever possible. The arrival of Reza, a stranger who is game to do the things Ali won't (bribe bureaucrats to deepen his well, maybe even kill his father) complicates things, and also, in a sense, solves them. The filmmaker's first name provides a not-insignificant clue as to what's going on, as his filmmaking deconstructs the story and his protagonist in initially confusing, and then riveting ways.  — Bob Mondello Come See Me In the Good Light Streaming on Apple TV starting Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       There's no way to make this documentary sound like the upbeat, rousing and often downright hilarious romp it is, but here goes: At the urging of comedian Tig Notaro, poet and spoken-word star Andrea Gibson and life partner and fellow poet Megan Falley invited filmmaker Ryan White and his crew into their home in 2021. It was mid-pandemic, and the crew was allowed full access to the couple's every thought and action as they dealt with turtledove love, mailbox madness, and – here's the part where you say, \"no, this does not sound like a good time\" — Gibson's Stage 4 ovarian cancer journey. At the Middleburg Film Festival screening I attended in October — three months after Gibson's death — the director spoke beforehand, giving the audience \"permission to laugh,\" which it definitely did. It also sniffled a bit, but less than you might expect, because Gibson's vibrant, assertively affirmative outlook doesn't really brook tears, and the filmmaker's warmth and humor, even in times of despair, gives the story a radiance that makes mundane moments feel precious, while allowing hopeful moments to raise goosebumps.  — Bob Mondello  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-coffee-beef-fruit-4fe084c2724ec6d92096efa263fdcf76","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:28:28+00:00","title":"Trump Announces Tariff Rollback on Key Food Imports Amid Inflation Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced a sweeping rollback of U.S. tariffs on key food commodities, including beef, coffee, tropical fruits, tea, and various agricultural products, amid rising public concern over inflation and high consumer prices.

broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue , resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. “We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, “I say they may, in some cases” have that effect. “But to a large extent they’ve been borne by other countries,” the president added. Related Stories Federal officials confirm officers have begun Charlotte immigration enforcement 4 MIN READ Brazilian coffee, beef and tropical fruit will still be tariffed 40%, says Brazil’s vice president 2 MIN READ Colombian officials say 7 children were killed in an airstrike against a rebel group this week 2 MIN READ Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump’s pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated , further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren’t a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday’s move as an acknowledgement that Trump’s policies were hurting American pocketbooks. “President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,” Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. “After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters’ fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a ‘pivot to affordability.’” Grocery bill worries Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don’t increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump’s tariffs on Brazil , a major beef exporter, had been a factor. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren’t produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump’s move to provide “swift tariff relief,” noting that import U.S. taxes “are an important factor” in a “complex mix” of supply chain issues. “President Trump’s proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,” the association said in a statement. In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he’d since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. Indeed, Friday’s announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. “Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs,” the president said then. “We’re going to have some coffee come in.” Tariff checks? Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, “Sometime during the year.” Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. “This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,” Trump said. “Everybody but the rich will get this. That’s not made up. That’s real money. That comes from other countries.” __ Associated Press writer Chris Megerian on Air Force One contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-execution-firing-squad-stephen-bryant-b09f3fdc1adb68e6ac342c5dc6155145","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:49:54+00:00","title":"South Carolina Executes Man by Firing Squad, Third Such Death This Year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Stephen Bryant, 44, was executed by firing squad in Columbia, South Carolina, on November 14, 2025, marking the third such execution in the state this year.

(AP) — A South Carolina firing squad has executed a man Friday, the third person to die by that method in the state this year. Three prison employees, all with live ammunition, volunteered to carry out the execution of Stephen Bryant, 44, who was pronounced dead at 6:05 p.m. Bryant killed three people in five days in a rural area of the state in 2004. Bryant chose to die by firing squad instead of lethal injection or the electric chair. He made no final statement and briefly glanced toward the 10 witnesses before the hood was placed on his head. The shots rang out about 55 seconds later. Bryant made no noise. The red bullseye target that marks the location of his heart flew forward off his chest. He had a few shallow breaths and then a final spasm a little over a minute later. A doctor checked him with a stethoscope for a minute before he pronounced Bryant dead. A media witness said after the execution that a pool of wetness emerged on Bryant’s chest where he was shot. Three family members of victims who served as witnesses held hands during the execution. Bryant is the seventh person put to death by South Carolina in 14 months after the state had a 13-year pause in executions when it couldn’t obtain lethal injection drugs. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster denied clemency for Bryant, according to his office. No South Carolina governor has offered clemency since the death penalty resumed in the U.S. in 1976. Final meal and memory For his final meal, Bryant had spicy mixed seafood stir-fry, fried fish over rice, egg rolls, stuffed shrimp, two candy bars and German chocolate cake. Bo King, a lawyer who works on death penalty cases in South Carolina, said Bryant had a genetic disorder, was a victim of sexual and physical abuse by relatives, and his mother’s binge drinking “permanently damaged his body and brain.” “Mr. Bryant’s impairments left him unable to endure the tormenting memories of his childhood,” King wrote in a statement. King said Bryant “showed grace and courage in forgiving his family and great love for those in and outside of his prison.” “We will remember his unlikely friendships, his fierce protectiveness, and his love for nature, the water, and the world,” King wrote. Firing squad vs. lethal injection drugs The firing squad has a long and violent history around the world. Death by a hail of bullets has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America’s Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. But in recent years, it’s been revived in the U.S. Some lawmakers say it’s the quickest and most humane way to execute a person. That’s since a number of botched executions by other methods, including lethal injection drugs. South Carolina and other states have struggled to maintain adequate supplies of lethal injection drugs. In part because of this, South Carolina paused executions for 13 years. The state then restarted in September 2024, after which four men have been executed by lethal injection and three by firing squad. The state is among several where the electric chair is still legal. King, the lawyer speaking on Bryant’s behalf, said each of the seven executions have been “brutal and shameful.” “None has made South Carolina safer or more just,” King said. The three other recent firing squad executions in the U.S. have been in Utah with none in that state since 2010. The method is also still legal in Idaho and a backup method if others aren’t available in Oklahoma and Mississippi. The 2004 killings in rural South Carolina Bryant admitted to killing Willard “TJ” Tietjen in October 2004 after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble. Tietjen was shot several times. Bryant then answered Tietjen’s phone after it rang several times telling both his wife and daughter that he was the prowler and had killed them, prosecutors said. Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of the road, he shot them in the back, authorities said. During the search, officers stopped nearly everyone driving on dirt roads in the area just east of Columbia, and told people to be leery of anyone they did not know asking for help. Bryant is the 43rd man killed by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S. At least 14 others are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year. Bryant is also the 50th person executed in South Carolina since the state restarted the death penalty 40 years ago. What happens during a firing squad execution The curtain opens in the death chamber of the prison with fewer than a dozen witnesses sitting behind bulletproof glass. The person is strapped into a chair. A white square with a red bull’s-eye target is placed over his heart by a doctor. Their lawyer can read a final statement. A prison employee then places a hood over the person’s head, walks across the small room and pulls open a black shade where the firing squad waits. Without an audible or visual warning to witnesses, the shooters then fire high-powered rifles from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away. A doctor will then come out within a minute or two, examine him and declare him dead. Lawyers for the last man executed by a firing squad said the shooters nearly missed the heart of Mikal Mahdi. They suggested by barely hitting the bottom of the heart that Mahdi was in agonizing pain for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly. ___ Associated Press writer Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis, Tennessee."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/rain-california-atmospheric-river-storm-flooding-wildfires-32c7a9b20f56fcc83863b746778df5ac","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:18:09+00:00","title":"Atmospheric River Brings Heavy Rain and Flood Risks to Southern California","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An atmospheric river brought heavy rainfall to Southern California, particularly impacting coastal Santa Barbara County and Los Angeles, with over four inches of rain recorded.

A smaller one also hit a mobile home park in the Santa Barbara County city of Carpinteria, damaging about 25 residences. The long plume of tropical moisture that formed over the Pacific Ocean began drenching the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday and was expected to unleash widespread rain over Southern California through Sunday with the heaviest amounts on Friday and Saturday nights.

Follow on Randy St. Aubyn, a homeowner in the Sierra Madre neighborhood by the Eaton fire burn scar, stood Friday afternoon behind wooden planks secured by sand bags in front of his house to deflect potential mud flows into the wash. He built the “mud fence” after a massive mud flow during storms a few years ago filled the crawl space under his house, lifting up the first floor. “Irrespective of what the news is saying and what you hear, you prepare for the worst. And then you can sleep at night,” he said. The heaviest rain could dump as much as an inch an hour over a large portion of the region. “The period of most concern is tonight through Saturday Night,” the National Weather Service said. “During this time, folks should be prepared for ample traffic incidents, delays, and a few road closures. This includes a few flooded roads, freeway lanes, and on-ramps and offramps.” While major effects of the storm have not yet been seen, a large downed tree smashed a car in an LA neighborhood Friday morning, local news outlets reported. No injuries were reported. Canyon roads, especially the most vulnerable ones like Topanga Canyon, will likely see mudslide and rockslides, and other neighborhoods ravaged by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area earlier this year should be on high alert, according to the weather service. More wet weather is expected early next week with another storm bringing light to moderate rain, offering only a brief break from the dousing.

2025-11-12T04:16:29+00:00\n\nTitle: Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/china-issues-travel-warning-for-japan-over-threats-to-intervene-in-taiwan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"10:13:29+00:00","title":"China issues travel warning for Japan over threats to intervene in Taiwan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has issued a travel warning to its citizens against visiting Japan due to diplomatic tensions sparked by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s remarks on November 7, in which she suggested a military response to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

On Friday, Beijing said it had summoned Japan’s ambassador.\n\nTokyo in turn summoned China’s ambassador after an “inappropriate” and now-removed social media post by a Chinese consul general in Osaka appeared to threaten Takaichi.\n\nTokyo has since said its position on Taiwan, just 110km (70 miles) from the nearest Japanese island, is unchanged.\n\nIn an online post late on Friday, China’s embassy in Japan warned its citizens against travelling to the country.\n\n“Recently, Japanese leaders have made blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan, severely damaging the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges,” the WeChat post said.\n\nThe situation presents “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan”, it added.\n\n“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese embassy and consulates in Japan solemnly remind Chinese citizens to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future,” the post said.\n\nIn a further development on Saturday, China’s largest airlines offered full refunds for flights on Japan routes before the end of the year.\n\nAir China, China Southern and China Eastern all published separate statements on the policies, which will allow ticket holders to refund or change Japan itineraries free of charge for flights from Saturday through December 31.\n\nBeijing insists Taiwan, which Japan occupied for decades until 1945, is part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to seize control.\n\nChina and Japan are key trading partners, but historical mistrust and friction over territorial rivalries and military spending often test those ties.\n\nJapanese leaders have previously avoided publicly mentioning Taiwan when discussing such scenarios, maintaining a “strategic ambiguity” also favoured by Tokyo’s main security ally,  the United States .\n\nA spokesperson for Taiwan’s Presidential Office, Karen Kuo, said Chinese travel restrictions on Japan and live-fire drills in surrounding areas have drawn attention to regional developments. She said Beijing’s “politically motivated, multifaceted threats against Japan pose a grave danger to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific”.\n\nThe China Maritime Safety Administration said  live-fire exercises  would be conducted in parts of the central Yellow Sea around the clock from Monday through Tuesday, and entry to the area would be prohibited, according to official media CCTV, which did not specify the area."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known as Super Typhoon Uwan in the Philippines, devastated northern provinces, killing at least 10 people and displacing over 1.4 million.

separate landslides in the mountainous province of Nueva Vizcaya, police told The Associated Press news agency, adding four others were injured.

revelation of a multi-million dollar embezzlement and kickbacks scandal involving Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company brought his name to the forefront, Tymur Mindich was a shadowy presence — navigating deals and moving behind the scenes with unseen influence, known to many, yet rarely spoken of. Mindich was linked to growing fears over his expanding influence within the country’s lucrative industries, his access facilitated by his ties to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two were once business partners and Mindich’s influence had expanded under Zelenskyy’s tenure. The full extent of that influence was exposed this week when Ukraine’s anti-corruption watchdogs released the findings of a 15-month investigation into a $100 million embezzlement scheme involving top officials and Ukraine’s state nuclear power company , accusing Mindich of being the mastermind behind the plot. Mindich has fled the country, with any criminal proceedings against him likely to be carried out in absentia. Two top government ministers have resigned. Ukrainian officials, experts and activists contend Mindich’s rise to power is closely tied to his privileged relationship with the president and Zelenskyy’s inner circle. The investigation does not implicate Zelenskyy himself, and he has openly supported the work of anti-corruption agencies while sanctioning Mindich once its findings were revealed. “What we were hearing only as rumors now has some evidence,” said activist Tetiana Shevchuk of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center. “For a long time we have heard that Tymur Mindich is a shadow controller of the energy sector.” The entertainment tycoon Until Zelenskyy’s presidency, Mindich, 46, was just one among many wealthy Ukrainian entertainment industry entrepreneurs. Mindich was a co-owner of Zelenskyy’s production company Kvartal 95, named for the comedy troupe that helped catapult the Ukrainian president to fame as a comedian before he entered politics. Zelenskyy transferred his stake in the company to his partners after he was elected. Despite expanding his business portfolio since Zelenskyy’s election, Mindich maintained ties to the entertainment world. Until the corruption probe was exposed this week, he was a producer of the comedy show “Stadium Family” on YouTube. In light of the scandal and his tarnished reputation, the show’s owners shut it down this week. He is also a relative of Leonid Mindich, who was arrested by Ukraine’s anti-corruption authorities in June when he was trying to flee the country, according to local reports. He was charged with embezzling $16 million from an electric power company. Rise under Zelenskyy Zelenskyy and Mindich’s close friendship is documented. The president used Mindich’s armored car during the final stretch of his presidential campaign in 2019. In January 2021, Zelenskyy celebrated his birthday in Mindich’s apartment during COVID. The two own apartments in the same building. After Zelenskyy’s 2019 presidential win, Mindich’s political ties grew. He was a close business associate of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, who backed Zelenskyy’s presidential campaign. Zelenskyy later cut ties with the billionaire and in 2023, Kolomoysky was arrested by Ukrainian security services on fraud and money-laundering charges. Businesses once associated with Kolomoysky began claiming that Mindich was now their beneficiary. “Gradually, in three years, he became not an oligarch, but a known businessman with an interest in a lot of businesses,” said Shevchuk, the anti-corruption activist. They include agricultural enterprises and the nationalized SENSE Bank. But, his name appeared most often in association with state energy companies, according to current and former Ukrainian officials, activists and experts. Ukrainian activists contend that without his close association with Zelenskyy, it would have been impossible for Mindich to cement his rise. Mindich “would have never been in politics, never been in a position of power or business without his connection to Zelenskyy, and this magnitude is worse because it’s happening during war time, and it is related to energy infrastructure at a time when Ukrainians don’t have electricity in their homes,” Shevchuk said. An alleged mastermind The case against Mindich rests on 1,000 hours of wiretaps revealing his significant influence over Herman Haluschenko, Ukraine’s energy minister from 2021-2025, until he was named justice minister in July. Haluschenko resigned that post after the investigation became public this week. While rarely named as a direct beneficiary in official documents, investigators cite extensive wiretapping evidence they allege shows Mindich exerted control over a network of loyalists who pressured contractors for Energoatom, the state nuclear power company, demanding kickbacks of up to 15% to bypass bureaucratic obstacles and do business smoothly. Investigators allege the illicit funds were siphoned off, laundered through shell companies and funneled into Mindich’s pockets and those of his associates. These findings collected by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, known as NABU, and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, or SAPO will be central to any future court proceedings. A possible drone dealer NABU is also conducting an investigation into Mindich’s alleged dealings with Ukraine’s top drone manufacturer, Fire Point , but has not yet revealed its findings. Fire Point, which develops deep-strike drones capable of hitting targets inside Russian territory, has denied any such dealings. Ukraine’s domestic drone industry has seen a swift and remarkable rise, fueled by wartime innovation and urgent military demands. What was once a niche sector quickly evolved into a formidable technological force within just a few years. Fire Point is among local companies and startups that have rapidly developed advanced drones for reconnaissance, surveillance and combat operations, supported by growing investments. The NABU investigation is looking into whether Mindich is the ultimate beneficiary of the company."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories.

Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/colombias-petro-inks-4-3bn-deal-for-17-fighter-jets-amid-regional-tension","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:27:44+00:00","title":"Colombia’s Petro inks $4.3bn deal for 17 fighter jets amid regional tension","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombian President Gustavo Petro has finalized a $4.3 billion agreement with Sweden’s Saab to acquire 17 Gripen E/F fighter jets, a move aimed at deterring potential aggression amid escalating tensions with the United States.

Colombia’s Petro inks $4.3bn deal for 17 fighter jets amid regional tension\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has announced a $4.3bn deal to buy Swedish warplanes at a time when his country is locked in  tension with the United States .\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Petro confirmed an agreement was reached with Sweden’s Saab aircraft manufacturer to buy 17 Gripen fighter jets, giving the first confirmation of the size and cost of the military acquisition that was initially announced in April.\n\n“This is a deterrent weapon to achieve peace,” Petro said in a post on social media.\n\nThe purchase of warplanes comes as Colombia and much of remaining  Latin America are on edge  due to a US military build-up in the region, and as US forces carry out a campaign of deadly attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n\nWashington claims – but has provided no evidence – that it has targeted drug smuggling vessels in its 20 confirmed attacks that have killed about 80 people so far in international waters.\n\nLatin American leaders, legal scholars and rights groups have accused the US of carrying out extrajudicial killings of people who should face the courts if suspected of breaking laws related to drug smuggling.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has also accused both Petro and his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, of being involved in the regional drug trade, a claim that both leaders have strenuously denied.\n\nPetro said the new warplanes will be used to dissuade “aggression against Colombia, wherever it may come from”.\n\n“In a world that is geopolitically messy,” he said, such aggression “can come from anywhere”.\n\nThe Colombian leader has for weeks traded insults with Donald Trump and said the ultimate goal of the US deployment in the region is to seize Venezuela’s oil wealth and destabilise Latin America.\n\nTrump has long accused Venezuela’s Maduro of trafficking drugs and more recently branded Petro “an illegal drug leader” because of Colombia’s high level of cocaine production. Trump has also withdrawn US financial aid from Colombia and taken it off its list of countries seen as allies in fighting drug trafficking internationally.\n\nAmid the war of words rumbling on between Washington and Bogota, Petro said last week that Colombia would suspend intelligence sharing with the US on combating drug trafficking, but officials in his government quickly rolled back that threat.\n\nThe AFP news agency reports that US and French firms had also tried to sell warplanes to Colombia, but, in the end, Bogota went with Sweden’s Saab.\n\nSwedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson said Colombia was joining Sweden, Brazil and Thailand in choosing the Gripen fighter jet, and defence relations between Bogota and Stockholm would “deepen significantly” as a result.\n\n🇸🇪🇨🇴I'm proud that Colombia today joins the Gripen E family, alongside Sweden, Brazil and Thailand. With the Colombian purchase of 17 Gripen E/F, our defence relations will deepen significantly & Colombia will receive one of the world’s greatest fighter jets.

As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has released a report warning that the global expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure—currently affecting over 2 billion people and with over 3,500 new sites under development—is endangering human lives, worsening climate change, and violating human rights.

expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes

a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on

vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"13:55:15+00:00","title":"DRC, M23 rebels sign framework deal for peace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Representatives from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have signed a comprehensive peace framework deal in Doha, Qatar, following months of diplomatic negotiations.

attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/gazas-medical-students-help-health-system-decimated-by-israels-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"17:57:42Z","title":"Gaza’s medical students help health system decimated by Israel’s war","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel’s over two-year war in Gaza has devastated the region’s health system, killing more than 1,700 medical personnel and repeatedly destroying key hospitals such as al-Shifa, where medical students like Eman Eyad and Islam Abu Assar have stepped in to perform critical medical duties without formal training.

The United Nations has  accused Israel of deliberately  targeting Gaza’s health facilities and killing medical personnel to destroy the besieged enclave’s healthcare system.\n\nIsrael continues to block essential medical supplies and equipment despite the month-old ceasefire agreement.\n\nSupporting Gaza’s decimated health system, medical students have become front-line healers, performing lifesaving work even before they have earned their degrees.\n\nThey are filling the void left by the many doctors who have been killed, and by others left exhausted from round-the-clock shifts to treat the many wounded under severely dangerous and resource-depleted conditions.\n\n“The war in Gaza has rewritten the rules of learning, of healing, and of growing up”, including for “Eman Eyad, a medical student who became a doctor in the heart of a war zone,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza.\n\nEyad had been completing her medical studies at the Islamic University – until Israel destroyed and bombed it on October 10, 2023.\n\n“But even without walls and without books, Eyad’s education continued,” said Abu Azzoum.\n\n“I get more experience, I can deal with 10 patients in one day, or more. I go to the surgery and I am second surgeon, so that’s something exciting for me,” Eyad told Al Jazeera. “The war makes me more powerful, more experienced.”\n\nEyad has been working as a doctor at al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest hospital.\n\nIsraeli forces  laid siege to the facility  in mid-November 2023, claiming without any concrete evidence that it contained a command-and-control centre operated by the Palestinian group Hamas. That devastation and destruction was followed by a second major raid on the hospital in March 2024.\n\nHamas and hospital administrators denied the claims about the control centre, with human rights groups, including Amnesty International, saying that the evidence Israel provided to back up this claim was inconclusive.\n\n“With senior doctors killed, displaced, or exhausted beyond measure, young students like Eyad stood to defend against the relentless tide of death,” said Abu Azzoum.\n\n“We had a new generation of doctors who are already working now as colleagues, helping us, treating our patients, with overwhelming hospitals, overwhelmed staff here,” Hani al-Faleet, a senior paediatrician training medical students at al-Shifa Hospital, told Al Jazeera.\n\nGaza’s medical personnel remain committed to their work, even amid personal tragedy.\n\n“I remained at my post until they asked me to evacuate,” Islam Abu Assar, a nurse working at al-Shifa Hospital, told Al Jazeera. “But I did not evacuate when my family fled to the south [of Gaza].”\n\nAbu Assar speaks of the shock and anguish she felt when her mother called her to tell her that her brother had died.\n\n“I never expected that one day I would receive my brother as a martyr,” she said.\n\n“It was the most difficult moment of my life … when they [the health and ambulance team] brought my brother.”\n\nDespite this horrific news, Abu Assar continued her work, even sleeping at the hospital.\n\n“I remained steadfast and kept working until my last breath,” she said. “I stayed inside the [al-Shifa Hospital] complex, providing care to the wounded and injured because of the shortage of medical personnel.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/trump-likely-to-sue-bbc-for-up-to-5bn-as-outlet-reels-from-editing-scandal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:02:21+00:00","title":"Trump says will sue BBC for up to $5bn over edited video","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump claims the BBC made a defamatory edit of his January 6, 2021 speech, falsely implying he incited the Capitol riot by stitching together three separate clips from nearly an hour apart.

President Donald Trump says he would likely sue the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) next week for as much as $5bn after the  British broadcaster admitted  it wrongly edited a video of a speech

information on a fuel blockade imposed by an al-Qaeda linked armed group.\n\nTF1 is a French commercial television station that broadcasts in several countries, and LCI, La Chaine Info, is a French free-to-air news channel that is also part of the TF1 group.\n\nMali’s High Authority for Communication (HAC) said in a letter to image distributors in Mali, dated November 13 and made public on Friday, that it had suspended TF1 and LCI, claiming the two private TV channels had made “unverified claims and falsehoods” in a broadcast on November 9.\n\n“LCI and TF1 television services have been removed from your packages until further notice,” the document read.\n\nThe letter said the authority disputed three passages in broadcasts by the two channels, specifically that “the junta has banned the sale of fuel,” “[the regions of] Kayes and Nioro are completely under blockade,” and “the terrorists are now close to bringing down the capital [Bamako].”\n\nThe channels have not been accessible in Mali since Thursday evening, a journalist for the AFP news agency reported.\n\nSince September, the Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin ( JNIM ) group, linked to al-Qaeda and primarily operating in Mali, has imposed a blockade on fuel entering the landlocked country, by sealing off major highways used by tankers to transport fuel from neighbouring Senegal and the Ivory Coast.\n\nIn recent weeks, fuel shortages caused by the blockade have created long lines at gas stations and further deteriorated the security situation in the country.\n\nSeveral Western embassies, notably those of the United States and  France , have asked their citizens to leave Mali.\n\nMali, alongside its neighbours Niger and Burkina Faso, is governed by military leaders who took power by force in recent years, pledging to provide more security to citizens.\n\nBut the security situation in the Sahel has worsened since the militaries took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and civilians killed both by armed groups and government forces.\n\nAll three countries have withdrawn from regional and international organisations in recent months, while  forming their own bloc  known as the Alliance of Sahel States.\n\nThe three West African countries have also wound back defence cooperation with Western powers, most notably their former colonial ruler,  France , in favour of closer ties with Russia, including Niger nationalising a uranium mine previously operated by French nuclear firm  Orano .\n\nWithin the three countries, the military governments are fighting armed groups that control swaths of territory and have staged attacks on army posts.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and other advocacy groups have accused the fighters, the military and partner forces of Burkina Faso and Mali of possible atrocities."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar

What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/more-details-emerge-of-israels-brutal-treatment-of-palestinian-detainees","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"15:14:58+00:00","title":"More details emerge of Israel’s ‘brutal’ treatment of Palestinian detainees","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Palestinian detainees in Israel, particularly in the underground Rakevet facility within the Ramla (Nitzan) prison complex, are facing severe abuse—including physical violence, starvation, denial of medical care, and psychological torture—despite official denials.

Another, known as KHD, said Israeli prison guards punish the prisoners “by breaking their thumbs”.\n\nThe reports are the latest to detail  wide-scale abuse  in Israel’s prison system, as the country has ramped up its arrests of Palestinians amid its two-year genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.\n\nMore than 9,200 Palestinians are currently detained in Israeli prisons, according to the  latest figures  from Palestinian prisoner rights group Addameer. The majority are in what’s known as administrative detention, held without charge or trial.\n\nScores of detainees from Gaza have also been held in a notorious Israeli military detention camp known as Sde Teiman, where reports of killings, torture and sexual violence, including rape, have been rife since the Gaza war began in October 2023.\n\nWhile the Israeli authorities have denied allegations of abuse, Palestinian prisoners who were recently released from the facilities as part of last month’s Gaza ceasefire deal described harrowing abuses.\n\nThe bodies of slain Palestinian detainees returned to the coastal Palestinian enclave under the ceasefire agreement also showed signs of torture, mutilation and execution, with some returned with  ropes still tied  around their necks.\n\nSeveral human rights groups in Israel have described the country’s prisons and detention facilities as  a form of torture  and cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n“Human rights organizations documented widespread abuses, including physical beatings, sexual violence, harassment, and threats – pointing to systemic and deliberate mistreatment,” the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI)  said in June .\n\nThe wave of abuse also comes amid a push from within Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government to harden its policies towards Palestinian detainees.\n\nEarlier this week, the Israeli parliament  advanced a bill  that would impose the death penalty for so-called “terrorism” offences based on “racist” motives against Israelis.\n\nThe move, which rights groups have condemned and said would exclusively target Palestinians, has been championed by Israel’s far-right National Security Minister  Itamar Ben-Gvir .\n\nAttacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian civilians, which have been burgeoning  in the occupied West Bank  and are carried out with impunity and often backed by the Israeli military, would not apply.\n\n“The enactment of a new law imposing the death penalty exclusively against Palestinians marks a new episode in the ongoing series of oppression and constitutes a grave escalation in Israel’s widespread violations against Palestinians, including hundreds of extrajudicial executions,” Addameer  said on November 9 .\n\nBasil Farraj, a professor at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank, said the underground Rakevet facility is just one part of this wider system of abuse.\n\n“This secret centre is in fact a symptom of the broader phenomenon of Israeli carcerality, where Palestinians continue to be treated in a violent and, in fact, an extremely brutal way that denies and negates all of their rights,” Farraj told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe explained that many Palestinians have been arrested under Israel’s so-called “unlawful combatants” law, which allows the authorities to detain them indefinitely on security grounds without having to prove any allegations.\n\n“The fact that you are held without trial adds another layer of psychological abuse and psychological torture,” Farraj said. “Not knowing why you are being arrested … adds to these layers of violence and torture that Israel has entrenched over the past two years.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/could-chile-be-on-the-verge-of-a-political-shift-in-its-2025-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"12:26:40+00:00","title":"Could Chile be on the verge of a political shift in its 2025 election?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chile is facing a pivotal political shift in its 2025 presidential election, with the left-wing candidate Jeannette Jara, a former labor minister and Communist Party nominee, leading a field of right-wing challengers.

election?\n\nWhen  Gabriel Boric  was sworn in as president of Chile in 2022, his victory was heralded by supporters as the beginning of a new era in the country’s political history.\n\nThe leftist leader, only 36 at the time, was swept into power by a wave of protests focused on cost-of-living issues.\n\nHe also promised to oversee the rewriting of the Chilean Constitution, created during the dictatorship of  Augusto Pinochet  and famous for locking the country into a pro-market model.\n\nBut several years later, after a  series  of  failed efforts  to replace the old constitution, Chile is on the verge of a sharp about-face. Boric is limited to one term at a time in office, and the country’s political right sees an opening to return to power, particularly as concerns rise over crime and immigration.\n\nSunday marks the first round of voting in Chile’s 2025 presidential race. But the race is likely to progress to a run-off, with  Jeannette Jara , the nominee for Boric’s coalition, leading a packed field of conservative rivals.\n\nThat fractured right-wing base, however, is likely to consolidate into a formidable force by the second round of voting.\n\nWho are the main candidates on Sunday’s ballot? Which issues are front and centre? And what do polls tell us about the first round of voting? We answer those questions and more in this brief explainer.\n\nThe first round of voting takes place on November 16, with 50 percent of the vote needed for a candidate to win outright.\n\nIf no candidate reaches that threshold, a second round of voting will take place on December 14.\n\nThe November 16 vote will, however, be crucial for deciding the composition of the country’s legislature, with all 155 seats in the Chamber of Deputies up for grabs, as well as 23 out of 50 seats in the Senate.\n\nMandatory voting is returning to Chile’s presidential elections for the first time since 2012.\n\nThat means participation rates are likely to increase. During the first round of the 2021 election, for instance, only about 47 percent of eligible voters participated.\n\nDuring obligatory voting in constitutional referendums, that figure has risen higher than 80 percent.\n\nThere were 15,450,377 registered voters in Chile as of 2024, according to the government’s electoral agency.\n\nBoric cannot seek re-election, but his governing coalition, Unity for Chile, has placed its hopes on Jeannette Jara, 51.\n\nUnity for Chile, which comprises eight parties, held a primary in June that Jara handily won, with 60 percent of the vote.\n\nAs a labour minister under Boric, Jara led an effort to  reduce the work week  from 45 hours to 40. She has campaigned on affordability, pledging to increase Chile’s minimum wage and make housing more affordable.\n\nHer candidacy is considered historic in contemporary Chilean politics, in part because of her working-class background and in part because she represents the Communist Party, which has not seen such broad support since Chile’s return to democracy.\n\nJara has sought to project stable and experienced leadership on the campaign trail. She has also put forward a public safety plan that would train more police and expand the country’s prison system.\n\nWhile the governing leftist coalition held a primary in June, parties on the centre-right and far-right declined to do so, leading to multiple candidates on November’s presidential ballot.\n\nThe frontrunner on the right is Jose Antonio Kast, a 59-year-old former congressman running for the Republican Party.\n\nThe far-right Kast  previously lost  to Boric in the 2021 presidential election, but this time around, he is projected to do well, particularly if he reaches the second round of voting.\n\nThere, he is likely to consolidate the support of other right-wing candidates who fail to advance to the final ballot.\n\nDuring his campaign, Kast has laid out a hardline vision on issues such as crime and immigration, pointing to the strongman leader of El Salvador,  Nayib Bukele , as an inspiration.\n\nHe has pledged to carry out a campaign of mass deportation, slash government spending and seek greater incentives for companies to invest in Chile.\n\nKast has also expressed support for the dictatorship of the late military leader Augusto Pinochet, who oversaw the torture, disappearance and killing of dissidents while in power from 1973 to 1990.\n\nAnother candidate running on a hard-right platform is Johannes Kaiser, a 49-year-old former YouTuber and a member of the Chamber of Deputies who is running with the National Libertarian Party.\n\nKaiser has promised deeper pro-market reforms than Kast, as well as an end to Chile’s involvement in international agreements on climate change and human rights. He has also staked out right-wing positions on public safety, calling for the use of the death penalty and greater access to firearms.\n\nOther candidates include Franco Parisi, a former radio host and economist running as an independent, and Evelyn Matthei, a pro-business, centre-right politician.\n\nAccording to polling averages from the Americas Society/Council of the Americas (AS/COA), the left-wing nominee Jeannette Jara is currently leading the race. She earns about 25 percent of voter support in most prominent polls.\n\nHer closest rival is Jose Antonio Kast, the far-right candidate, with about 20-percent support.\n\nLibertarian Johannes Kaiser and independent Franco Parisi have seen slight upswings in support for their campaigns. Each has between 10 and 14 percent support.\n\nCentre-right candidate Evelyn Matthei has seen a small decline but is polling in the same range, between 11 and 14 percent.\n\nAs voters head to the polls, a handful of issues are top of mind. An October poll from the research firm Activa shows that crime and immigration dominate as areas of concern, with unemployment and health tied for third.\n\nChile remains a relatively safe country compared to others in Latin America, with some of the lowest rates of violent crime in the region.\n\nBut it is partly due to the expectation of lower crime that a recent surge in organised criminal activity, corruption and theft has been so disorienting for voters.\n\n“I had to install remote surveillance cameras [and] chain the tables, and on weekends I hired a security guard to help keep watch,” Leidy Paredes, the owner of a nightclub in the capital of Santiago, told The Associated Press news service.\n\nChile is not the only country in South America to see an uptick in crime. Over the last several years, a surge of violence in  Ecuador  has likewise helped propel candidates promising “mano dura” or “strong hand” policies, although experts note that tackling crime is a multifaceted endeavour and force alone is rarely the answer.\n\nIn Chile’s presidential race, right-wing candidates like Kast have promised an “iron-fisted approach to crime”.\n\nWhile left-wing contenders like Jara have accused their rivals of scaremongering, they too have been pushed to take a harder line on crime and public safety. Jara, for instance, has promised to build more prisons.\n\nThere has also been a public backlash to immigration in the country, following a substantial increase in migrants and asylum seekers, many of them fleeing economic and political turmoil in Venezuela.\n\nA report from two of the country’s immigration agencies found that migration to Chile increased by 46.8 percent between 2018 and 2024. From 2022 to 2024, the increase was a much lower 4.5 percent.\n\nAround the world, immigrants are frequently targets for concerns about crime and economic stagnation, forming a convenient scapegoat for politicians. Candidates like Kast have promised a campaign of mass deportation, while Jara has proposed creating a temporary registration system to keep track of undocumented arrivals.\n\nChile’s economic slowdown is also playing a role in the election, with Chile’s 9 percent unemployment rate one of the highest in Latin America."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/thousands-march-for-climate-action-outside-cop30-summit-in-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00+00:00","title":"Thousands march for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of people, including Indigenous activists and youth climate leaders, marched in Belem, Brazil, during the halfway point of the COP30 climate summit to demand greater inclusion of Indigenous voices and stronger climate action.

people have marched through the streets of the Brazilian city of Belem, calling for the  voices of Indigenous peoples  and environmental defenders to be heard at the United Nations COP30 climate summit.\n\nIndigenous community members mixed with activists at Saturday’s march, which unfolded in a festive atmosphere as participants carried a giant beach ball representing the Earth and a Brazilian flag emblazoned with the words “Protected Amazon”.\n\nIt was the first major protest outside the conference, which began earlier this week in Belem, bringing together world leaders, activists and experts in a push to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIndigenous activists previously  stormed the summit , disrupting the proceedings as they demanded that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva take concrete action to ensure their territories are protected from growing threats.\n\nAmnesty International warned in a recent report that  billions of people  around the world are threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel projects, such as oil-and-gas pipelines and coal mines.\n\nIndigenous communities , in particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make our voices heard from  the Amazon  and demand results,” he said. “We need more Indigenous representatives at COP to defend our rights.”\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help  poorer countries adapt to climate change."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/ukraine-says-it-attacked-russian-oil-refinery-near-moscow","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:49:21+00:00","title":"Ukraine

day after Russia launched  massive, deadly attacks  on Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian army said on social media on Saturday that it hit a refinery in the Ryazan region as “part of efforts to reduce the enemy’s ability to launch missile and bomb strikes”.\n\nThe Russian attacks on Ukraine’s capital on Friday killed at least six people and wounded  nearly three dozen more , with residential buildings and other sites targeted.\n\nDescribing it as a “wicked attack”, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said about 430 drones and 18 missiles, including ballistic and aeroballistic missiles, were used in the Russian assault.\n\nThe Ukrainian strike on the Ryazan refinery comes as the two countries have been trading attacks on energy infrastructure, particularly ahead of another punishing winter of war, as they seek to gain an advantage in the nearly four-year conflict.\n\nLast week, Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s state-run electricity transmission systems operator,  announced that most regions  across the country would undergo power cuts as crews worked to repair infrastructure damaged in Russian strikes.\n\nSeparately on Saturday, Ryazan Governor Pavel Malkov said Russian air defences shot down 25 Ukrainian drones over the region during the night.\n\n“Falling debris caused a fire on the premises of one enterprise,” Malkov said on Telegram, adding that there had been no casualties.\n\nRussia’s RIA news agency also reported that the situation at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine remained stable after one external power line had been switched off.\n\nThe Dneprovskaya power line supplying electricity to the plant was switched off as a result of the automatic protection being triggered, the plant said a day earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian army  faced difficult battles  this week in the southern Zaporizhia region.\n\nUkrainian forces were  forced to withdraw  from five villages after intense fighting against Russian troops in the area.\n\nZelenskyy said in a video posted on social media on Thursday that he had spent the day in Zaporizhia at the front line and met with troops and other army leaders.\n\n“The Russians want to do everything to make life unbearable for Ukraine,” he said. “We are doing everything to ensure protection for our state and all Ukrainians.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/sudans-army-captures-two-areas-in-north-kordofan-as-rsf-burns-more-bodies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"15:45:50+00:00","title":"Sudan’s

has increasingly turned east over the past weeks as the RSF solidifies control over the western parts of the war-torn country, now in its third year of a brutal civil war.\n\nThe fighting, fuelled by  arms supplies from the region , has created what the United Nations has called the largest displacement crisis in the world. More than 12 million people have been forced from their homes, and tens of thousands have been killed and injured. The UN has also confirmed starvation in parts of the country.\n\nThe RSF said last week it accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by the United States and other mediators, with the announcement coming after an international outcry over atrocities committed by the paramilitary group in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state in western Sudan.\n\nBut the army has refused to agree to a ceasefire under the current battle lines, and both sides have continued to amass troops and equipment in the central parts of the country to engage in more battles.\n\nThe RSF launched an offensive against the Kordofan region at the same time as it took el-Fasher late last month, seizing the town of Bara in North Kordofan state as a crucial link between Darfur and central Sudan. The army had recaptured the town just two months earlier.\n\nMore than two and a half weeks after fully capturing el-Fasher from the army, the RSF has continued to dispose of bodies in large numbers.\n\nAn analysis of satellite imagery released by Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) on Friday exposed four new locations where paramilitary fighters are disposing of bodies in and around el-Fasher.\n\nActivities consistent with body disposal are visible at the University of Alfashir, a structure on the edge of Abu Shouk camp for internally displaced people, a neighbourhood near al-Hikma Mosque, and at Saudi Hospital, where  RSF forces massacred hundreds .\n\nThe HRL could not conclude how many people the RSF had killed or how quickly, but it said the observations are alarming, given the fact that the whereabouts of many civilian residents remain unknown.\n\n🚨ATROCITY ALERT🚨 @HRL_YaleSPH  has identified four new locations where the RSF is disposing of bodies in and around El Fasher.  #KeepEyesonSudan\n\n🛰️ @Vantortech https://t.co/y5gaMRlBm2   pic.twitter.com/OsCVb1ihTf\n\n— Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) at YSPH (@HRL_YaleSPH)  November 14, 2025\n\nNathaniel Raymond, the lead researcher of that report, said an estimated 150,000 civilians are unaccounted for, and daily monitoring of city streets shows no activity in markets or water points, but only RSF patrols and many bodies.\n\n“We can see them charred.

Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/un-extends-peacekeeping-mission-in-disputed-abyei-region-for-another-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:19:23+00:00","title":"UN extends peacekeeping mission in disputed Abyei region for another year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Security Council has extended the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) by one year until November 2026, following a 12-0 vote with Russia, China, and Pakistan abstaining.

calling the lawmaker a “lunatic” and accusing her of going “far left”.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform late on Friday, Trump said, “I am withdrawing my support and endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the great state of Georgia.”\n\nThe US leader, labelling Greene “wacky”, said all the lawmaker did was “COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN”, despite his “record achievements” in office.\n\nGreene, a member of the House of Representatives, has long been a reliable ally and fierce defender of Trump, even sporting a Make America Great Again (MAGA) baseball hat at President Joe Biden’s 2024 State of the Union address.\n\nBut in recent months, she has taken positions at odds with the White House and her fellow Republicans, including criticising them during the  just-ended federal government shutdown , saying the Trump administration needed a plan to help people set to lose health insurance subsidies as part of planned cuts.\n\nMore notably, Greene has also become a vocal campaigner for transparency and the full release of files related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – a recurrent scandal that continues to engulf President Trump.\n\nGreene responded to Trump’s announcement on Friday with screenshots of a text message she sent the president about the Epstein case, claiming it “sent him over the edge”.\n\n“It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” she wrote on X.\n\n“Most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream,” she said.\n\nGreene also claimed Trump is going after her “hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next week’s vote to release the Epstein files”.\n\nPresident Trump just

The White House claimed the communications “prove nothing”.\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged his supporters to move on from the scandal, labelling suggestions that there is an Epstein client list with his name on it a “hoax” pushed by his Democratic opponents.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Greene labelled Trump’s resistance to releasing the files a “huge miscalculation”, adding that she does not believe he has anything to hide.\n\nTrump made no mention of the Epstein issue in his post disowning Greene, claiming the schism between the pair began when he discouraged her from running for senator or governor due to low polling numbers.\n\n“She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls any more, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 US Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic ‘s call every day,” Trump said.\n\nTrump continued that Republicans in Georgia are “fed up with her and her antics” and should they find an alternative to run at the next midterms, that candidate will have his “complete and unyielding support”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/irgc-says-tanker-seized-near-irans-waters-based-on-judicial-order","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"12:30:01+00:00","title":"IRGC says tanker seized near Iran’s waters based on judicial order","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has intercepted the Marhsall Islands-flagged tanker Talara in the Strait of Hormuz, claiming it transported unauthorized petrochemicals.

order\n\nTehran, Iran –  The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has confirmed Western intelligence reports that it intercepted a Cyprus-registered tanker that transited through the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe Marhsall Islands-flagged Talara was confiscated on Friday morning while carrying 30,000 tonnes of petrochemicals, Iran’s powerful military and political organisation said in a statement carried by state media.\n\n“This operation was carried out successfully in accordance with legal duties and for the purpose of safeguarding the national interests and resources of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and under the orders of judicial authorities,” the IRGC said, alleging that the vessel committed a “violation for transporting unauthorised cargo”.\n\nUnnamed officials with the administration of United States President Donald Trump told media outlets that the IRGC took over the vessel as several Western intelligence agencies confirmed the report.\n\nTalara, operated by Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement, had departed a port in the United Arab Emirates for Singapore.\n\nThe company said it lost contact with the vessel, adding it is working with maritime security agencies and the vessel owner as it prioritises crew safety. It said the cargo was high-sulfur gas oil, which is, among other things, used as fuel for marine vessels.\n\nBritish security agencies also said they were tracking the incident.\n\nThe United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) identified the location of the incident at 20 nautical miles (equivalent to 37km) east of the Emirati city of Khor Fakkan, and said “state activity” was behind it.\n\nSecurity agency Ambrey said three small boats approached Talara as it was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz, with the ship later deviating from its route in the Gulf of Oman to steer towards Iran.\n\nFlight-tracking data analysed by The Associated Press on Friday showed a US Navy MQ-4C Triton drone loitering for hours over the area during the seizure.\n\nUS Central Command, which oversees Washington’s military deployment in the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia, said in a statement on Friday that it was “aware of the incident” involving Talara and was “actively monitoring the situation”.\n\n“Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,” it said, without assigning blame.\n\nThis is the first such interdiction by Iranian forces in the Strait of Hormuz in more than a year.\n\nIn July 2024, the IRGC seized a Togo-flagged, UAE-managed products tanker some 61 nautical miles (113km) southwest of Iran’s port of Bushehr in an operation it said was carried out based on a judicial order to intercept the vessel “systematically engaged in fuel smuggling”.\n\nIRGC commandos in April 2024  rappelled down from a helicopter  onto the deck of a Portuguese-flagged containership linked with an Israeli billionaire. That incident came shortly after Israel bombed Iran’s consulate in Syria, killing seven IRGC members, including two top generals.\n\nAnother Israeli-linked container ship was  attacked and damaged  by a drone in the Indian Ocean in November 2023, an attack the US blamed on Iran. The US, UK and Israel said Iran was responsible for a drone attack off the coast of Oman in the Arabian Sea that killed two European crew members in 2021.\n\nIn May 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and  held them until November  that year to secure the release of an Iranian-flagged tanker seized in Greece as a result of US sanctions.\n\nWashington also accused Iran of orchestrating a string of attacks on commercial ships in the Strait of Hormuz in 2019, including using limpet mines, which led to increased maritime insurance costs and forced reroutes for some vessels.\n\nThe strategic waterway is where about 20 percent of the global oil trade and roughly one-third of global liquefied natural gas is exported through. Tehran has long threatened to shut it off in reaction to rising external pressure.\n\nAll the maritime incidents occurred after Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and imposed stringent sanctions that have only expanded since.\n\nThe US also  assassinated Iran’s top general Qassem Soleimani  during the tenure of the first Trump administration in 2020, and, together with Israel, bombed Iran’s top nuclear facilities during a 12-day war in June.\n\nThe seizure of Talara on Friday came as Iran’s authorities opened an exhibition in Tehran to display a variety of missiles, drones and other military capabilities.\n\nThe IRGC has been ramping up its efforts to produce more ballistic missiles and replace air defences destroyed during the war that also  killed dozens of Iran’s top military commanders  and nuclear scientists, among more than 1,000 people."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/pa-warns-against-agents-of-displacement-in-gaza-after-south-africa-flight","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"11:38:30+00:00","title":"PA warns against ‘agents of displacement’ in Gaza after South Africa flight","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Palestinian Authority warning has emerged against organized networks, such as Al-Majd Europe, that are allegedly displacing Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to South Africa without proper documentation or consent.

displacement’ in Gaza after South Africa flight\n\nPalestinians, especially those in the Gaza Strip, must be wary of networks that seek to remove them from their homes in line with Israeli interests, the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned.\n\nThe warning came a day after 153 Palestinians, who left Gaza without knowing their final destination and without proper paperwork,  arrived in South Africa  on board a flight from Kenya on Friday and were held up for 12 hours as authorities investigated the issue.\n\nSouth Africa, which is advancing a  genocide case against Israel  at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), gave the war-ravaged Palestinians 90-day visas.\n\nThe Palestinian ministry on Saturday expressed “deep appreciation” for the support from the South African authorities and people, as well as the decision to grant temporary visas for the people who it said departed from Ramon airport in southern Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian embassy in Pretoria said it is working to assist the travellers who have “endured over two years of Israeli genocidal war, killing, displacement, and destruction”.\n\nBut it warned that companies, unofficial entities and unregistered intermediaries inside Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory are trying to mislead Palestinians and incite them towards leaving.\n\n“The ministry calls upon our people, especially our people in the Gaza Strip, to exercise caution and not fall prey to human trafficking, to merchants and companies of blood, and to agents of displacement,” it said.\n\nQuestions continue to swirl  around the shadowy organisation that orchestrated the mystery trip – Al-Majd Europe – which Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh reports does not have an office in its stated headquarters of Sheikh Jarrah, occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in Gaza said, “Palestinians are still willing to leave the war-battered territory if they get the opportunity because they have been living through genocide. There have been two years of relentless bombardment. They’ve lost everything they had; they do not have houses.”\n\n“Some of the Palestinians who still have a little bit of money are the ones leaving with their children. They’re saying there is no future here in Gaza,” Khoudary explained.\n\n“We’ve asked Palestinians in Gaza if they’re still willing to apply to leave through the organisation  Al-Majd Europe.  They’re saying they’ll do whatever it takes to leave. This is especially true of those who are sick or wounded, or who have families abroad, ” she added.\n\nAccording to South Africa’s Border Management Authority, 130 Palestinians ended up entering the country, while 23 were transferred from South Africa to other destinations from the airport itself. Most are expected to apply for asylum.\n\nA South African humanitarian aid organisation, Gift of the Givers, said it was committed to accommodating the visitors during their stay.\n\nCharity founder Imtiaz Sooliman told public broadcaster SABC that he did not know who had chartered the aircraft, and that the first plane carrying 176 Palestinians had landed in Johannesburg on October 28, with some of the passengers departing for other countries.\n\nHe said accounts from the Palestinian arrivals indicate that Israel appears to be removing people from Gaza and putting them on a plane without stamping their passports, in order to leave them stranded in third countries.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office have not reacted to the incident, but Israel and the United States have repeatedly pushed to move as many Palestinians out of Gaza as possible,  holding negotiations with many countries  over this.\n\nThe Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli military organisation in charge of the Gaza border crossings, was quoted as saying by Israeli media that it received approval from a third country to receive the Palestinians as part of an Israeli government policy allowing Gaza residents to leave. The third country was not named.\n\nAfter facing nonstop bombing and famine in Gaza, the Palestinians were  told to leave behind all their belongings  and hop on a flight to an unknown destination.\n\nAntony Loewenstein, author of The Palestine Laboratory, a book about Israel’s arms and surveillance industry, said the transit scheme could have been operating weeks or months before being noticed.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera from Indonesia’s capital Jakarta that there have been rumours about companies making such flights, which apparently “requires Israeli permission as well as other countries’ permissions”.\n\n“This is the concept of people making money out of other people’s misery,” he said, also pointing to the murky operations and website of the company that ran the scheme.\n\n“I see it as a form of ethnic cleansing,” Loewenstein said. “The issue is people providing [the transit] and the Israeli state facilitating it, a state where many ministers in the Israeli government, and frankly the Israeli public, want no Palestinians left in Gaza, and I fear this is part of that mission.”\n\nLater on Saturday, Jordanian King Abdullah and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed “zero-tolerance” for any displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. Sharif hosted King Abdullah in Islamabad on a two-day state visit.\n\n“On the issue of Palestine, both leaders acknowledged the unanimity of views and principled positions taken by Pakistan and Jordan regarding the post-war Gaza; zero-tolerance for any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,” Sharif’s office said in a statement."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-12-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including a G4 geomagnetic storm alert from the U.S. weather agency, Amazon’s recent layoffs, controversial claims by former President Trump linking Tylenol to autism and accusing nations like Russia, China, and Pakistan of nuclear testing, Delhi’s experimental use of cloud seeding to combat pollution, Nvidia’s global expansion amid US-China trade tensions, a major capital deal for OpenAI valued at $500 billion, advances in mRNA-based cancer vaccines enabling 'off-the-shelf' treatments, and speculation about the UK becoming an AI hub due to significant foreign tech investments.

Caribbean\n\nThe United States military has confirmed that four people were killed in a strike on a boat in international waters – the 20th reported attack on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific – as officials of President Donald Trump’s administration were reported to have held meetings on possible military operations in Venezuela.\n\nIn a post on X on Friday, the US Southern Command said the strike on Monday was authorised by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and that the boat was “trafficking narcotics”, without providing evidence.\n\nSouthern Command shared an accompanying video clip that showed an aerial view of the boat travelling in the Caribbean before being struck and exploding in a ball of flames.\n\nInternational law and human rights experts have repeatedly said that such attacks  amount to extrajudicial executions , even if those targeted are suspected of drug trafficking.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered at least 20 military strikes in recent months against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coasts of Latin America, killing some 80 people.\n\nThe Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that senior Trump administration officials held three meetings at the White House this week to discuss options for possible military action against Venezuela, citing unnamed officials.\n\nThe reported meetings come as the Trump administration has continued to significantly expand the US military’s presence in the Latin America region, including with F-35 aircraft, warships and a nuclear submarine.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pentagon said the Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group, which includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with at least 4,000 sailors and dozens of “tactical aircraft” on board.\n\nIn total, there are now about 12,000 US sailors and Marines in the region, in what Secretary Hegseth on Thursday formally named “ Operation Southern Spear “.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\n\nBut Trump  has said  that he would not “necessarily ask for a declaration of war” in order to continue killing people “that are bringing drugs into our country”.\n\nA newly published Reuters/Ipsos poll found that US military escalation in South America is not popular with the US public.\n\nJust 29 percent of those surveyed said they supported the extrajudicial killings of suspected traffickers, and only 21 percent said they supported military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nLeaders from several Central and South American countries have condemned the ongoing US strikes and military buildup in the region, saying it violates a 2014 agreement designating the area as a “Zone of Peace”.\n\nThe Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), a regional bloc of 33 countries, signed the declaration in Havana, Cuba, in 2014. The US is not a member.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said in a statement that the US deployment is “an act of provocation that threatens the self-determination of our peoples”, according to Venezuela-based TV channel Telesur.\n\nBrazilian leader  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  and Colombian leader Gustavo Petro have also criticised the US strikes.\n\nIn a national broadcast  last week, Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro said  the Trump administration was “fabricating a new eternal war” in the region.\n\nMaduro said his country, which has been struggling economically under US sanctions, has prepared what he called a  “massive deployment”  of forces in case of a US attack."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third such object detected entering the solar system, after its discovery in July 2025 by the ATLAS team in Chile.

study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/jailed-tunisian-opposition-figure-hospitalised-amid-hunger-strike-family","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:00:19+00:00","title":"Jailed Tunisian opposition figure hospitalised amid hunger strike: Family","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jawhar Ben Mbarek, a leading opposition figure in Tunisia, has been hospitalised due to severe dehydration from a 17-day hunger strike protesting his detention since February 2023.

Indigenous leaders and historians argue that the items were not voluntary gifts but were taken during colonial-era assimilation policies, including the 1885 potlatch ban and the Catholic Church’s role in residential schools.

Canada\n\nThe Vatican has handed back 62 Indigenous artefacts to Canada’s Catholic bishops, framing the move as “a concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity” after years of pressure from Indigenous communities seeking the return of cultural heritage removed under colonial rule.\n\nThe items were formally transferred on Saturday during a meeting at Vatican City between Pope Leo and representatives of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, including its president, Bishop Pierre Goudreault.\n\nThe bishops said they would pass the artefacts “as soon as possible” to Canada’s National Indigenous Organisations, which will then oversee their return to their communities of origin.\n\nThe objects were sent to Rome nearly a century ago for a vast 1925 Vatican exhibition curated by Pope Pius XI, who sought to display the reach of Catholic missions and the cultures they encountered. Many pieces later became part of the Missionary Ethnological Museum before being absorbed into the Vatican Museums in the 1970s.\n\nThe Vatican maintains the items were “gifts” to Pius XI.\n\nBut  Indigenous groups  and historians have long disputed that claim, arguing that such offerings could not be deemed voluntary in an era when Catholic missionaries held immense influence over Indigenous lives.\n\nIn those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government’s forced assimilation policy of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called a “cultural genocide”.\n\nPart of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the United States and Europe, as well as private collections.\n\nMomentum for the objects’ return grew after the late Pope Francis met Indigenous delegations in 2022 and delivered a historic apology for the church’s role in  residential schools .\n\nDuring that visit, Indigenous leaders viewed several items in the Vatican’s collection, including wampum belts, an Inuit kayak, masks and weapons, and requested their return. Francis later said he supported returning such objects “where it’s necessary to make a gesture”.\n\nThe Vatican’s handover marks a century since the 1925 exhibition that first brought the items to Rome.\n\nA joint statement from the Vatican and the Canadian bishops described the transfer as “an act of ecclesial sharing”, adding that Canada’s Catholic leadership is committed to ensuring the artefacts are “properly safeguarded, respected and preserved” until they are reunited with their rightful custodians."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, expanding the list to include Reddit and Kick in addition to major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at the age of 97.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv4dx05q5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"15:46:15.238+00:00","title":"Trump targets longtime MAGA ally Marjorie Taylor Greene","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has publicly denounced Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, accusing her of turning 'far left' and undermining 'America First' by supporting a bipartisan effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.

massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/at-least-2-dead-21-missing-in-landslides-in-indonesias-java-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:54:13+00:00","title":"At least 2 dead, 21 missing in landslides in Indonesia’s Java island","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At least two people were killed and 21 remain missing after landslides triggered by several days of heavy rainfall in the Cilacap district of Central Java, Indonesia.

a process she started because of potential fertility issues from her endometriosis.\n\n\"It can be very challenging, especially with endometriosis or something chronic, or infertility issues like I've struggled with,\" Sophie said.\n\n\"How do you bring that up to someone new and hope it doesn't scare them away?\"\n\nDespite it feeling uncomfortable, she brought the condition up soon after meeting.\n\n\"I was having to explain... about injections and surgeries, and all of that, very unsexy topics to be talking about.\"\n\nSource: NHS\n\nIt affects around one in 10 women in Wales.\n\nThere's currently no cure for the condition but there are treatments to help ease symptoms including surgery to cut away tissue, or remove part of the organs affected by endometriosis.\n\nSophie credits fiancé Dillon with being supportive and keen to learn about the condition.\n\n\"I had plenty of hours of education from Sophie over a G&T, because Sophie was so open about it,\" he said.\n\n\"It made learning a lot easier, but she didn't mind the stupid questions as well.\"\n\nThe Newport-based Dragons prop, 29, who has 57 caps for Wales, said asking questions and being open was key to offering a partner support.\n\n\"Just try to help in whichever way, like I always say 'is there anything I can do' with the answer 99% of the time being no but at least I like to ask... and get a hot water bottle every now and again,\" he added.\n\nSophie, now a women's health advocate and podcaster, said that being with someone supportive, whatever the challenges, was vital.\n\n\"I genuinely don't think I could be with someone who didn't want to understand the endometriosis, because ultimately, I will live with it forever.

edit\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn   [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.\n\nThe corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.\n\nThe BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation.\n\n\"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"\n\nThe president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.\n\nA search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said on Saturday evening: \"We have had no further contact from President Trump's lawyers at this point.\n\n\"Our position remains the same.\"\n\nIn a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"\n\nHe called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nIn July this year, US media company Paramount Global  agreed to pay $16m  (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.\n\nSir Craig Oliver, former BBC editor and ex-director of politics and communications for former Prime Minister David Cameron, told BBC Today programme that this is a \"nightmare\" situation for the public broadcaster.\n\n\"The problem is that public money could be spent fighting this or settling this,\" Sir Craig said, adding that Trump doesn't \"understand the BBC, how it is funded or how it works\".\n\nThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nMore than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nIn the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nControversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\n\nIn its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\n\n\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.\n\nLawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\n\n\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.\n\nThey added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nIn its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.\n\nFirst it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.\n\nWhen the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.\n\nSecondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.\n\nThirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.\n\nFourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.\n\nFinally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.\n\nThe BBC's apology came hours after a second  similarly edited clip , broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c629m7jm777o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"17:00:29.333+00:00","title":"Bus driver released after Stockholm crash arrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bus driver arrested following a deadly crash in Stockholm on Valhallavägen near the Royal Institute of Technology has been released after authorities found no evidence of intent.

Caribbean and eastern Pacific have continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear.\n\nTens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US.\n\nThey have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region.\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nPresident Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets.\n\nIn a statement, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nIn at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nIt is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.\n\nBetween 2 September and 13 November, US forces hit at least 21 vessels in 20 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nCollectively, at least 80 people have been killed.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nOne investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nIn a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".\n\nBut some legal experts have said strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that  he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity .\n\nCritics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.\n\nAccording to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.\n\nIn October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\n\n\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"\n\nAs part of the operation, the US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.\n\nThis force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, as well as a range of guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nAdditionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline.\n\nTrump has also acknowledged that he authorised  the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.\n\nThis build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the left-wing socialist government of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nOn 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\nMaduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace.\n\n\"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjr4xw83eko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:11:46.022+00:00","title":"Trump rolls back tariffs on dozens of food products","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump has reversed his previous trade policy by signing an executive order to roll back tariffs on dozens of food products, including coffee, bananas, beef, avocados, tomatoes, coconuts, and mangoes.

rolls back tariffs on dozens of food products\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has  focused on the issue  since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.\n\nThe dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.\n\nThese goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.\n\nTrump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.\n\nHe has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead.\n\nBut grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an  investigation into the meat-packing industry , accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".\n\nHe has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering  $2,000 tariff rebate cheques  to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.\n\nBut the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".\n\nHe added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\"\n\n\"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.\n\nEconomists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.\n\nWhile inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed  price increases , with groceries up 2.7% from last year.\n\nThe Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.\n\nIn another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of  trade deals with four Latin American countries .\n\nThis week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.\n\nThe White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies.

Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as \"pilgrims of the imagination\", helping to \"bring hope\".\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.\n\nIt was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the \"troubling decline\" in cinema-going.\n\nHailed by director Spike Lee as a \"great day\", the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.\n\nBeneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate – and for its \"capacity to amaze\".\n\nBut he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called \"the world's wounds\".\n\n\"Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated,\" the Pope said. \"Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.\"\n\nSix months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.\n\nHis predecessor, Francis, was  a charismatic Argentinian  known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leo's style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.\n\nIt's not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall – who came from all over the world – made it onto the Pope's own top film list.\n\nThis week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, It's a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benigni's multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.\n\nAmong those who did join today's A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant – of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.\n\nAt a time of immense pressure on film, not long after  a major Hollywood strike  and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.\n\nHe was applauded loudly when he talked of the \"quiet dedication\" of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.\n\nHe also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the \"beating heart of communities\".\n\n\"More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity,\" the Pope said.\n\nAfter a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by  Blanchett .\n\n\"He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people,\" the Australian-born star told reporters.\n\nOne of many who came bearing gifts, the actress – who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR – placed a woven bracelet in the Pope's hand. \"It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced,\" she explained later.\n\nLee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0yz5r8lypo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"12:26:07.598+00:00","title":"What next as Donald Trump says he will take legal action against the BBC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump has escalated his legal threats against the BBC, claiming that a Panorama edit misrepresented his speech and has now stated he will sue for damages ranging from $1 billion to $5 billion.

2025-11-15T12:26:07.598+00:00\n\nTitle: What next as Donald Trump says he will take legal action against the BBC\n\nAnyone who thought the BBC's apology to Donald Trump was going to stop his threat of a lawsuit was, quite frankly, deluded.\n\nThe BBC chairman Samir Shah perhaps  summed it up in the interview he gave me  the day after the director general and the CEO of News resigned. He called the president \"a litigious fellow\".\n\nThat's an understatement, evident in the number of legal cases Trump has taken out against various US media companies.\n\nThe president, based on his GB News interview, is clearly hurt by what he sees as an \"egregious\" edit, and he has now apparently upped the amount he says he will sue the corporation for.\n\nWhile on board Air Force One on Friday, Trump told reporters the figure would be \"anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn\".\n\nTo put this in context,  the BBC's annual income from the licence fee was £3.8 billion last year .\n\nOn Friday, Trump said: \"They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" He wants to know why Panorama edited two clips of his speech together to give a \"totally different meaning\".\n\nHe doesn't accept the BBC's response  that what happened was unintentional .\n\nThis is a very serious moment in the history of the BBC. It stands or falls by being viewed as impartial - a source to trust in a world where trust in institutions is falling.\n\nInstead, the corporation is being accused of the opposite - and faces an expensive and very public battle with the most powerful man in the world.\n\nSo where does it go from here?\n\nEver since the president first threatened legal action, it was clear that the corporation did not intend to offer him compensation. It believes it has a case that, whatever error was made, no harm was caused to Trump by the Panorama programme.\n\nHe was elected president soon after it went out and anyway, says the BBC, the programme wasn't broadcast on any US channels, so how could it have harmed him?\n\nI think there was a certain consensus, inside and outside the corporation, that the notion of using licence fee payers' money to settle with Trump was a non-starter.\n\nAs one former senior BBC executive put it to me, after the BBC had rejected offering compensation, \"they've made the right call\". But this person also said, if the president did decide to sue, the BBC would have to \"batten down - and get the best lawyers in Florida\".\n\nThe reason to settle would have been to bring down costs in the long run.\n\nNow it looks as if the BBC will be involved in a protracted, costly court battle at a time when it should be 100% focused on the discussions over the renewal of  its charter , which are ramping up.\n\nThe people at the top of the BBC should be fully concentrating on what is, in normal times, a fundamental moment for the corporation - when what it's for, its scope, how it will be funded, the details of its very existence are all hammered out between government and BBC in time for a new charter at the start of 2028.\n\nIt's already losing the man who should have led that -  Tim Davie, the director general .\n\nNow top BBC brains will be diverted, to game out its next moves in what could be a very damaging, even existential fight with Donald Trump. The legal fees alone could get very expensive.\n\nThis might all have been avoided if the BBC had been open about the error much earlier and corrected it. Instead, it faces a long road.\n\nBut there may be routes off it.\n\nMight the BBC ask the UK government to step in through back channels? Would a call from Prime Minister Keir Starmer persuade Trump to change his mind? Would Starmer even want to get involved and expend his own political capital with the US president?\n\nOne positive for the BBC this week  was the robust nature in which the culture secretary Lisa Nandy defended the corporation .\n\nShe talked about the widespread trust in BBC News and described the corporation as \"a light on the hill for people in times of darkness\" which brings the country together, whether through Celebrity Traitors or its VE Day coverage.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, has called the BBC \"worse than fake news\". He claims the corporation and its journalists are corrupt.\n\nThe fight is well and truly on."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09n94qg92o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"14:23:11.204+00:00","title":"Epstein files: Who else was mentioned?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"More than 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate have been released by US lawmakers, revealing extensive contacts with high-profile individuals including former President Donald Trump, journalist Michael Wolff, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and media figures such as Kathryn Ruemmler and Ariana Huffington.

lawmakers have released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSome of the documents mention Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles; US President Donald Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment, who highlight the extent of Epstein's contact book.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in about 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nHere are some of the the other names that came up, which does not indicate wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.\n\nMichael Wolff, 72, is an American journalist and columnist - as well as a prolific author of books on the wealthy and the famous.\n\nFire and Fury, the first of several books spanning Trump's first stint as US president, came out in 2018, with descriptions of a dysfunctional White House and salacious details about the US commander-in-chief. Trump said it was \"full of lies\".\n\nThe new batch of files related to Jeffrey Epstein shed light on a relationship that appears to indicate a correspondence between Wolff and the late convicted sex offender.\n\nAttention has focused particularly on one of the emails, in which Wolff appears to give Epstein advice in relation to Trump, as Trump was campaigning for the White House for the first time.\n\nWolff wrote to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN was planning to ask Trump, as a presidential candidate, about his relationship with Epstein.\n\nEpstein replied: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"\n\nThe two go on to discuss a strategy, with Wolff writing: \"I think you should let him hang himself.\"\n\nIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.\n\nResponding to the release in a video posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.\n\nIn fact, Wolff disclosed before the latest presidential election in the US that he had interviewed Epstein \"periodically\" for Fire and Fury - and released tapes of those conversations.\n\nThe documents include correspondences between Epstein and Larry Summers, who was former Democratic President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary. It had been previously reported that the two men knew each other.\n\nThe emails indicate the two met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"presidnt [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".\n\nIn a separate email from late November 2016, just after Trump's election, Summers asked Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".\n\nDue to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin proximity\" and a \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".\n\nA spokesperson for Summers declined to comment, but referred the BBC to past statements by Summers. A representative told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 that the former official \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\".\n\nThe House of Representatives Oversight Committee released several email exchanges between Epstein and Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer who served as White House counsel during the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nIn August 2018, Ms Ruemmler and Epstein discussed hush-money payments made by Trump to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election - an issue over which Trump was later convicted of falsifying business records. Trump denies allegations that he had an affair with Daniels.\n\nThe exchange between Ms Ruemmler and Epstein culminated with Epstein writing: \"You see, I know how dirty donald is.\"\n\nThe bank Goldman Sachs, where Ms Ruemmler is currently chief legal officer and general counsel, told CNBC it was standing by its employee.\n\n\"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs. Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Goldman spokesperson Tony Fratto said in a statement to  CNBC.\n\nIn 2023, Ms Ruemmler  told the Wall Street Journal,  \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\nThe BBC has asked Ms Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs for further comment.\n\nThe name of billionaire investor and on-off Trump supporter Peter Thiel appeared again in the latest Epstein documents - having first been mentioned in a batch made public in September.\n\nAccording to the newly-released files, Epstein wrote to Mr Thiel in November 2018 to invite him to visit him in his Caribbean island, where some of Epstein's crimes are thought to have been committed.\n\nThe BBC has asked the Thiel Foundation and the investor's Founders Fund for comment. A representative for Mr Thiel told Politico that he had never visited the island.\n\nMr Thiel was critical of Epstein on an August 2024 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\n\n\"You know, I met Epstein a few times as well,\" Thiel said.\n\nMr Thiel said he was introduced to Epstein by another Silicon Valley executive in 2014.\n\n\"I didn't check, didn't ask any - enough questions about it,\" Mr Thiel said. He surmised that \"Epstein knew a lot about taxes\".\n\nThe latest document drop includes more correspondence between the famed linguist Noam Chomsky, 96, and Epstein. Many of their discussions were academic or personal.\n\nOccasionally the conversations turned to the subject of Trump, including in December 2016.\n\nIn his email, Mr Chomsky tells Epstein: \"I notice your prediction was right about Trump avoiding the White House as far too primitive.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted a representative of Mr Chomsky for comment.\n\nIn responses to previous reporting by the Wall Street Journal on their relationship, Mr Chomsky said Epstein had helped him move money between his accounts without \"one penny from Epstein\", and to acknowledge that \"I knew him and we met occasionally\".\n\nEpstein consulted publicist Peggy Siegal as the scandal around him and his associates unfolded.\n\nEpstein wrote to Ms Siegal in 2011 asking her to contact the founder of the Huffington Post, Ariana Huffington, in order to discredit the story of Virginia Giuffre, who was a prominent accuser of Epstein and Andrew. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.\n\nEpstein told Siegal that Huffington \"should champion the dangers of false allegations...\".\n\nThe email exchange shows Ms Siegal telling Epstein: \"If you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Ariana Huffington from me…\".\n\nIn a phone interview, Ms Siegal told the BBC she had never passed Epstein's request to Huffington. \"I did not call Ariana,\" she said. Huffington \"used to publish my writing and there's no reason in the world I would jeopardise that relationship,\" Ms Siegal added.\n\nBut the fact that Epstein had asked was \"not unusual. It was a ridiculous request,\" she said.\n\n\"Jeffrey had a habit of trying to ensnare people into his delusional world,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Huffington told Politico she was \"was never contacted and never sent a reporter\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwyyd8l58o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:26:30Z","title":"Zelensky vows energy sector overhaul after $100m corruption scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged a sweeping overhaul of Ukraine's energy sector following a major corruption scandal that saw approximately $100 million embezzled, with key figures including Energoatom, Ukrhydroenergo, and Naftogaz implicated.

the CIA and now I'm suing\n\nThe first thing Lana Ponting remembers about the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital in Montreal, Canada, is the smell - almost medicinal.\n\n\"I didn't like the look of the place. It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba.\n\nThat hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour.\n\nIt was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control. Now, she is one of two named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for Canadian victims of the experiments. On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed.\n\nAccording to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal.\n\n\"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan.\n\nOnce there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent.\n\nOver 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved.\n\nAt the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\".\n\nDr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times.\n\n\"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled.\n\nThe technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications.\n\n\"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma.\n\nMedical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous oxide gas, a sedative known as laughing gas.\n\n\"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request.\n\nThe harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability.\n\nMs Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she says\n\nFor decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently.\n\nShe says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed.\n\nMs Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan.\n\n\"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said.\n\nShe says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares.\n\n\"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said.\n\nThe Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability.\n\nFor Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure.\n\n\"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\"\n\nAlthough Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967.\n\nBut regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical.\n\nShe says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice.\n\n\"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7zlngwepo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"17:12:16.072+00:00","title":"DR Congo and M23 rebels sign framework for peace in Qatar","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 rebels have signed a new framework for peace in Qatar, following a prolonged conflict that escalated in January 2025 when M23 seized key cities like Goma and Bukavu.

and M23 rebels sign framework for peace in Qatar\n\nRwandan-backed M23 rebels and the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo have signed a framework for peace in the east of the country.\n\nThe ceremony was held in Qatar, which along with the US and the African Union, has been trying to mediate an end to decades of conflict in the resource-rich region.\n\nEarlier this year, the M23 captured the eastern region's main cities of Goma and Bukavu. Previous attempts to secure peace have failed.\n\nThe US's Africa envoy Massad Boulos said the document covered eight protocols and that most still required work. He also acknowledged that prisoner exchanges and ceasefire monitoring had been slower than originally hoped.\n\nKinshasa is demanding the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from its territory.\n\nKigali says this can happen once the Congo-based FDLR rebel militia is disbanded. It is largely made up of ethnic Hutus linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\nThe new framework also addresses humanitarian access, the return of displaced people and protection of the judiciary, Boulous is quoted as saying by the AFP agency.\n\nIt builds on a declaration of principles signed by the two sides in Doha in July, as well as a deal made in the same city last month on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.\n\nBefore that, in June, talks between Rwanda and DR Congo brokered by Washington resulted in the signing of a peace deal that was hailed by US President Donald Trump as a \"a glorious triumph\" but was  swiftly violated by the warring parties .\n\nThe M23 is one of the biggest parties in this conflict, but was not directly involved in the US-brokered ceasefire deal. It has always favoured the talks mediated by Qatar, saying they will address \"the root causes\" of the conflict.\n\nDecades of conflict escalated in January when M23 rebels seized control of large parts of eastern DR Congo including the regional capital, Goma, the city of Bukavu and two airports.\n\nSince January, thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of civilians forced from their homes.\n\nAfter the loss of territory, the government in Kinshasa had turned to the US for help, reportedly offering access to critical minerals in exchange for security guarantees. Eastern DR Congo is rich in coltan and other resources vital to the global electronics industries.\n\nRwanda denies supporting the M23,  despite overwhelming evidence , and insists its military presence in the region is a defensive measure against threats posed by armed groups like the FDLR.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lkjd2kmdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:00:42.059+00:00","title":"The 'bogan' Australian giving War & Peace an irreverent remake","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ander Louis, a Melbourne IT worker writing under the pen name Ander Louis, has created a humorous and irreverent bogan-style translation of Leo Tolstoy's classic novel War & Peace, using Australian slang and colloquialisms such as 'bloody hell', 'sheila', and 'g'day'.

He was the pregnant sheila's hubby. Like his missus, he was pretty good looking himself.\"\n\nThose lines are straight from a new translation of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War & Peace, set in the world of Russian high society in the early 19th century.\n\nExcept this is a \"bogan\" version translated by Ander Louis, the pen name of a Melbourne IT worker who moonlights as a writer.\n\nHe's poured a metaphorical can of Australian beer over the novel by converting Tolstoy's prose into a lingo that wouldn't sound out of place in the popular Aussie sitcom Kath & Kim.\n\n\"It's how you'd tell it down the pub,\" Louis, whose real name is Andrew Tesoriero, told the BBC.\n\nThe 39-year-old started the project in 2018 as a joke, turning Russian princesses into \"sheilas\" and princes into \"drongos\", but is now on the cusp of signing a book deal.\n\n\"The number one reason I started doing it was to make me laugh, and I thought if it's making me laugh, maybe other people will too so let's put it out into the world.\"\n\nBogan, a term which first emerged in Australia in the 1980s, initially meant an \"unsophisticated and uncultured person\" with negative connotations, but not for Louis.\n\n\"I've never really thought of it as an insult, more a term of endearment,\" he says.\n\nAnd his version of the Russian literary masterpiece - which starts with the phrase \"bloody hell\" - is about being flippant and irreverent.\n\n\"It's just a good exclamation of surprise,\" Louis jokes.\n\nElsewhere, a noble is a fair dinkum, while the death of an important character is announced by \"he's cactus\".\n\n\"It changes the tone quite significantly,\" Louis laughs.\n\nFor years, Louis avoided picking up War & Peace, set during the Napoleonic wars of the early 1800s, given its heft.\n\nThe novel is divided into 15 books as well as an epilogue, which itself is split into two parts. With more than 1,200 pages to plough through, it's often regarded as the Everest of literature with prose as insurmountable as the famed peak.\n\nBut in 2016, Louis joined an online community where participants pledge to finish the book in a year by reading at least one chapter – there are 361 – every day.\n\nHe loved it so much, he did it twice.\n\n\"I became a bit of an accidental expert,\" he tells the BBC from Lilydale, on the outskirts of Melbourne.\n\nDuring this time, the part-time indie author was writing a novel with dark psychological themes so to lighten the mood, he started making War & Peace irreverent and funny.\n\nAnd for more than six years, Louis' project remained a little-known hobby he did in his spare time, self-publishing the first two translated books of War & Peace and selling a handful of copies.\n\nThat all changed earlier this year when a New York-based tech writer stumbled across the bogan version, posting excerpts from Louis' book in which he describes Napoleon as an \"alright bloke\", the high-ranking Prince Vasili as \"a pretty big deal\" and Princess Bolkónskaya as \"smoking hot\".\n\n\"Out of nowhere, it just went berserk. Overnight, I sold 50 copies,\" Louis says.\n\nThe father-of-two thinks the US interest in his bogan translation might be due to a \"Bluey effect\" given the popular Australian children's cartoon has been the most streamed show in the US for almost two years.\n\n\"Aussie-isms are in vogue over there at the moment\".\n\nAt first glance Tolstoy's book, filled with the lives of rich, powerful Russians, seems worlds apart from modern-day Australia.\n\nBut Louis argues bogan is the ultimate equaliser as the informal slang works across the social spectrum, whether it's in Australia or the world of Russian aristocrats.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of different types of bogan,\" Louis says.\n\nMark Gwynn, a senior researcher at the Australian National University, who helps compile the Australian National Dictionary, agrees. \"Bogans can be wealthy, poor, or in the middle so it's more about the way they behave, dress, socialise and talk,\" he says.\n\nHe says in more recent times, the term has also been used affectionately of someone considered a bogan or even in reference to oneself such as the term \"inner bogan\".\n\nAnd speaking \"bogan\" refers to casual speech with lots of local sayings, he says.\n\n\"Most Australians would know if you said 'speaks bogan' or 'bogan Australian' that the language would be highly informal with many slang and colloquial words and phrases, including uniquely Australian ones.\"\n\nBut there's no direct translation for the term in proper English – it's uniquely Australian.\n\n\"Bogans can live in [both] rural and urban areas so they don't equate to hillbillies, bumpkins, yokels, rustics,\" Gwynn says.\n\nNor are bogans the same as rednecks, as they can hold varied political views, while the British term \"chav\" – also typically used in a derogatory way to describe people from a poor background - doesn't apply either.\n\nThose shape-shifting bogan qualities along with Louis' varied resume - kitchen hand, energy analyst, Uber driver, punk rocker, Tokyo resident – makes him \"strangely qualified\" to create a bogan translation.\n\n\"When I'm drawing on voices, it's just quite genuinely from things I've seen and done… through all those different walks of life.\"\n\nCharacters in his bogan version say \"g'day\", friends are \"mates\" and those with questionable ethics are deemed \"shonky\".\n\nBeautiful ladies are \"chicky babes\", with one so beguiling she's \"hot as a tin roof in Alice\" – a nod to the extreme heat of Alice Springs' desert landscape.\n\nOne prince is an \"absolute true-blue legend\" whose vibrant eyes \"blazed like a bushfire\" while another is a \"bit of a yobbo\" who thinks others are \"carrying on like a pack of galahs\".\n\nWhile his version is peppered with plenty of profanity – which the BBC can't publish – part of the appeal is to make the book more accessible.\n\n\"The best feedback I've found is people saying how much easier it is to understand what's going on,\" he says.\n\nLouis likens himself to Pierre, the main protagonist in War & Peace, who represents the \"everyman\" as the illegitimate son of a rich aristocrat who inherits a huge fortune, catapulting him into Russian high society.\n\nHe says he feels like he's the \"bumbling buffoon\" in the \"walled garden that is traditional publishing\" and that he's committed a kind of \"literary heist\".\n\n\"I've leaned over the fence… and just pinched the crown jewel - their most revered book - and taken it down the pub.\"\n\nAnd what would Tolstoy – who, though born a noble, later in life renounced his privileged upbringing and wealth – think of the bogan version?\n\n\"I actually think he would get a kick out it,\" Louis says."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/us/politics/ruben-gallego-democrats-midterms.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"14:12:19-05:00","title":"Gallego Pitches Demoralized Democrats on a Midterm Message","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona is spearheading a Democratic strategy for the 2026 midterm elections by blaming Republicans for rising health care costs and cuts to Medicaid, using the recent government shutdown and the impending expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies as evidence of Republican failure.

government, voting with the G.O.P. to end the longest shutdown in American history and unleashing a wave of recriminations from all corners of the party.\n\n“We saw the shutdown,” Mr. Gallego said in his opening remarks, acknowledging the pain it had created for federal workers and food aid recipients. “It was harsh. It was horrible.”\n\n“The last thing that we need to be seeing,” he continued, “is people playing the poor against the less-poor, only for the rich to win at the end. Because that is exactly what happened. So we’re going to continue to make sure that we fight to make sure that people have access to affordable health care.”\n\nMr. Gallego was test driving what Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists say will be the party’s core message for the 2026 midterm elections, centered around placing the blame for massive increases in health care premiums and looming cuts to Medicaid squarely at Republicans’ feet.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

action\n\nMarching to the beat of pounding sound systems, thousands of climate protesters have been bringing their message to the gates of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.\n\nChanting and singing \"free the Amazon\", demonstrators in host city Belém have been carrying three giant coffins reading Oil, Coal and Gas flanked by two grim reapers.\n\nIndigenous groups displayed signs reading \"the answer is us\" as an inflatable elephant and anaconda weaved through the crowd under the hot sun.\n\nIt is the first time since 2021 that protesters have been allowed to demonstrate outside the UN climate talks. The last three took place in countries that do not permit public protest.\n\n\"We are holding a funeral for fossil fuels,\" Tuga Cíntia told the BBC. She is from the theatre group Hydra Dance from the Federal University of Pará.\n\n\"I'm here because enough is enough with COP meetings and theory. It's time for us to actually act,\" she said.\n\nIndigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from across the world joined the march in their thousands.\n\nAs the midday sun intensified, some sought shelter in a petrol station forecourt.\n\n\"Fossil fuels are still being burned. We know all too well what it's like to live on the frontline of climate change,\" Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from Samoa, a low-lying island extremely vulnerable to climate change, told the BBC.\n\n\"We are here after so many COPS, marching for justice, for the end of fossil fuels,\" Ilan, from the non-governmental organisation 350, who lives in Brazil, said.\n\nSome carried signs reading \"demarcation now\", calling for indigenous groups to be given legal ownership of their territories.\n\nHundreds of indigenous groups live in the Amazon and are regarded by experts as the best protectors of biodiversity and forests.\n\nSmaller sister protests have taken place around the world including in the UK.\n\nSecurity was tight at the COP30 venue as police with riot shields guarded the entrance.\n\nOn Tuesday  protesters carrying signs broke through security lines at the summit . The incident caused minor injuries to two security staff and some limited damage to the venue.\n\nRepresentation of indigenous voices has been a flashpoint in these talks, some of whom have set up stalls outside the fenced-off COP30 venue to sell products to passing delegates.\n\nThe meeting was dubbed the \"indigenous people's COP\" but many groups feel their concerns over deforestation, land protection and resource extraction in their homes are not being heard.\n\nNegotiations continued at the COP30 talks on Saturday. Nearly 200 countries are meeting to try to make progress on tackling climate change.\n\nLittle progress was made in the first week of the talks, although some delegations say they are pushing for an agreed strategy to deliver on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels.\n\nPresident Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and chose the city of Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon.\n\nBut shortly before the talks opened last week, his government  granted permission to the Brazilian state oil company to explore for oil  at the mouth of the Amazon.\n\nOn Friday, analysis of attendee lists by the coalition Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) suggested a record number of delegates from fossil fuel companies are attending the meeting.\n\nIt suggests 1,600 lobbyists are in Belém, a 12% rise from the COP meeting last year.\n\nIt is common for business leaders to come to the talks to strike deals.\n\nWith the US strikingly absent from negotiations, progress has been slow. It is the first time the country has sent no delegation to the talks, after President Donald Trump branded climate change \"a con\".\n\nEarlier in the week a group of senior climate leaders wrote a letter calling on the summit to ensure the facts about climate change were \"upheld.\n\nTen countries have signed an initiative called Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, launched by the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change.\n\nIt aims to create international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote evidence-based information on climate issues.\n\nOn the core issues of how to tackle the root cause of climate change and how to help countries adapt to ongoing global warming, Brazil has promised the talks will deliver action to implement years of deals and pledges.\n\nThe talks continue into next week."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p5xn8qjpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:55:39.818+00:00","title":"Prashant Kishor: Why India's political start-ups rarely succeed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prashant Kishor, a seasoned political strategist, launched Jan Suraaj, a data-driven political start-up in Bihar in 2023, aiming to break the cycle of stagnation in India's poorest and most populous state.

magician -  the political  strategist trusted by everyone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to powerful regional leaders such as Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee.\n\nBut when the 48-year-old finally stepped into the arena himself, the spell snapped.\n\nKishor launched Jan Suraaj (People's Good Governance) with the swagger of a data-driven political start-up and the promise of breaking the cycle of stagnation in Bihar, India's poorest and third most populous state.\n\nHe spent two years walking across the state, built a slick organisation and fielded candidates in almost all 243 seats. The media buzz was huge, but Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat, scraping only a sliver of the vote, as  Modi's BJP-led alliance swept to power.\n\nFor all the attention Kishor commanded - often more than established leaders - the party could not convert visibility into votes. In India's febrile and deeply divided political marketplace, his debut, many believe, stands as a cautionary tale: breaking into the system is far harder than diagnosing its flaws from the outside.\n\nThe modern history of Indian politics bears this out.\n\nSince the rise of the regional Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1983, very few new parties have crossed the threshold of relevance. Those that have - from West Bengal's Trinamool Congress to Odisha's Biju Janata Dal - were breakaway factions of major parties, anchored in existing social bases.\n\nOthers, like Assam's Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in 1985 or Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party  (AAP) decades later, rode on the back of mass mobilisation and political crises. Kishor's Jan Suraaj had neither. It was not born of a street movement, nor did it emerge into a moment of anti-incumbent fury. Despite its many problems, Bihar in 2025 appeared to be largely content with the status quo.\n\n\"There was no anti-incumbency wave - voters largely stuck to established political and social loyalties. Without a visible crisis or widespread dissatisfaction, Kishor's party never appeared a credible alternative, despite hard work and mobilisation,\" says Rahul Verma, a political scientist.\n\nJan Suraaj's debut in Bihar also contrasted sharply with most new Indian parties.\n\nWhile parties like the AGP, TDP and AAP grew from \"socio-political movements that already had deep emotional and grassroots resonance\", and AAP was born from a mass anti-corruption movement, Jan Suraaj was conceived as \"more of an intellectual and strategic project\" - a strategy-driven initiative to fill what Kishor called a \"political vacuum\", says Saurabh Raj of the Delhi-based Indian School of Democracy.\n\n\"The subsequent padayatra [a long, grassroots walk across the state to meet people] tried to turn that intellectual idea into a people's campaign. But it still lacked the organic, movement-based energy that typically propels new parties to relevance. In that sense, Jan Suraaj feels more like a 'designed political start-up' than a party born of agitation or upheaval,\" adds Raj.\n\nKishor bet that this meticulously designed political project could substitute for a loyal constituency.\n\nHe talked of governance, jobs, forced migration for jobs and education - a compelling agenda in a state long trapped by caste and patronage politics. Reaching Bihar's 130 million mostly young people, Kishor brought hype, methods, charisma - and even memes.\n\nBut many believe his party lacked the combustible emotional energy that propels insurgent political outfits. Kishor's refusal to contest a seat himself may have deepened doubts about whether he was running an experiment or offering an alternative.\n\nThe Bihar verdict laid bare a structural truth of Indian politics: attention is not organisation, and media hype without ground strength can backfire.\n\nAs Raj notes, Jan Suraaj \"failed to become a serious contender on any seat\", and even its modest vote share \"shows the gap between visibility and strength\". The party has recognition but no natural social base - no caste, religious, gender or urban constituencies like its rivals, he says.\n\nVerma puts it more bluntly: start-ups fail more often than they succeed - in business and in politics.\n\n\"We tend to remember only the successes, but most new parties fail,\" he adds.\n\nBuilding a party requires visibility, organisation, mobilisation and the right candidates - each a separate challenge, especially without a track record of voters trust, says Verma. Jan Suraaj fielded candidates in 238 seats, most of them first-timers.\n\nWhat does the failure of Kishor's high-profile Jan Suraaj tell us about Indian voters? Kishor drew crowds wherever he campaigned, was articulate and dominated media coverage - yet his party lost to a coalition led by 74-year-old veteran Nitish Kumar, whom he had bet would never return to power.\n\n\"Indian voters today are more politically aware and issue-sensitive than ever before, but they also remain deeply pragmatic. They often appreciate the freshness of a new agenda but tend to 'vote safe' unless convinced of a party's viability,\" says Raj.\n\nHe believes Jan Suraaj's focus on governance, jobs and migration was coherent and appealing, but without a charismatic electoral face, voters struggled to see it as a winning alternative.\n\nBy contrast, AAP's early success in Delhi hinged on anti-corruption campaigner Arvind Kejriwal personally contesting against Sheila Dikshit, the then chief minister of Delhi, a symbolic act that converted volunteers into voters.\n\n\"Kishor's decision to stay away from contesting limited that emotional connect and credibility. For new parties, a compelling agenda matters, but a relatable, risk taking leader who embodies that agenda is often the tipping point,\" says Raj.\n\nYet, this may not be the end for Kishor's party. In the past, he has promised to stay in Bihar and strengthen its grassroots presence and agenda if he lost the polls.\n\nRaj believes if Jan Suraaj can maintain a steady ground presence, cultivate local leadership and avoid the \"post-election dormancy\" that traps many new parties, it may gradually convert attention into influence.\n\n\"Bihar's political landscape is fluid, traditional caste loyalties are evolving and there is a growing appetite for credible alternatives. If Kishor chooses to lead from the front politically rather than strategically, and continues the grassroots engagement beyond the electoral cycle, Jan Suraaj could become a meaningful electoral force by 2030,\" he says.\n\nAs one local voter put it to a reporter in a village in Bihar: \"People might respond to [Kishor] in the next election. This time, he's just getting his feet wet - he's not some superhero who can soar immediately.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xv530kxeo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"19:28:22.149+00:00","title":"Vatican returns dozens of indigenous artefacts to Canada","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Vatican has returned 62 Indigenous artefacts to Canada, 100 years after they were taken to Rome in 1925 for a missionary exhibition.

During the trip, the communities requested the return of their artefacts.\n\nThe CCCB says the items will be transferred to Canada's National Indigenous Organizations which \"will then ensure that the artefacts are reunited with their communities of origin\".\n\nThe cost of repatriating the items has been prepaid by the tribes, which plan to hold ceremonies before they can be officially returned, according to CBC.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister praised the move, calling it, \"an important step that honours the diverse cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples and supports ongoing efforts toward truth, justice, and reconciliation\".\n\nThe items had been held in the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The church has described the items as \"gifts\" that were given by tribal leaders. Critics have disputed this characterisation, given the power imbalance at the time they were transferred.\n\nThe items were taken to Europe during a time when Canadian law, as well as Catholic decrees, prohibited native spiritual practices, leading to a ban on certain items used during ceremonies."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33p05lyzlko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:09:43.017+00:00","title":"The Barking Dog quiz cheating: BBC visits pub - and sees the questions","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At The Barking Dog pub in Urmston, Greater Manchester, a long-standing team was accused of cheating during weekly pub quizzes by using smartwatches and the Shazam app to access answers.

pub quiz - but one thing was amiss.\n\nThe same team kept winning the prize of a £30 bar tab, leaving regulars scratching their heads and some stopped turning up in protest.\n\nThen, a twist. Bosses at the pub in Urmston, Greater Manchester, said they received an anonymous tip-off and caught the team \" cheating red-handed\"  when players were spotted whispering into their smartwatches to get answers.\n\nThey revealed the curious goings-on in an Instagram post last week - and it swiftly went viral, attracting interest from people around the world.\n\nHere at the Barking Dog on a damp, dark Wednesday night this week, BBC News has come along to witness the first edition of the quiz since the scandal emerged.\n\nAnd regulars have made a packed return, with 17 teams taking part, though the almost Traitors-like tale of alleged cheating looms large.\n\nThe suspect team, which managers are refusing to name, were banned from the quiz - but are welcome to still attend the pub - yet some regulars say the furore has left them \"too scared\" to wear their smartwatches.\n\nOne of the teams, formed of Grace, Beth, Olivia, Ellie and Jack, has been entering the quiz for about three years.\n\nThey say they're pleased the cheating team has finally been rumbled, as other teams had stopped coming. \"It's brought people back and it's nice to see familiar faces back in the pub,\" says Grace.\n\nOlivia says the latest quiz has an electric atmosphere while Beth says the \"drama\" caused by the alleged cheating saga has been \"insane\", with their teammate Ellie's sister even talking about it in Australia.\n\nThey say they knew the cheating team had been up to no good for \"ages\".\n\n\"It was so obvious,\" Grace says, adding that on the music round the team would know all the answers and who featured on each track played on every genre, from 90s Hip Hop to Rock n Roll.\n\n\"We just thought at first they were incredibly intelligent,\" she tells us.\n\nHowever, she says it soon transpired \"they weren't quite the eggheads we thought they were\".\n\nJack is taking extra precautions tonight, though. \"I didn't wear my smartwatch because I didn't want to be done,\" he admits.\n\nTry five questions from The Barking Dog's pub quizzes in recent weeks.\n\nOver on another table, Nia - who was taking part in the quiz with her friends Callum and Anastasia - says the recent media attention about their local pub quiz has been \"crazy\".\n\nShe, too, says she has seen people \"on their phones and smartphones\" recently, but has not known for sure if they were cheating.\n\nRather than feeling robbed of a cash prize when he found out about the scandal, Callum says he actually found it \"quite funny\".\n\nNia adds: \"We never do well enough to come in the top three to be mad enough.\"\n\nAs well as luring back regulars, the shenanigans have attracted new teams to the quiz, like John and Carole Kelly, who are entering for the first time.\n\nCarole says she and John are desperate \"to find out who it is, as everybody is\".\n\nShe says they have had a great night but they, too, are not daring to use their mobile phones even to check the time.\n\n\"I won't even get my phone out of my bag,\" Carole confesses.\n\nRob Hardie, co-director of the Barking Dog, says the cheating team was often getting the answers \"pretty much 100% correct, which no one really does so it was a tell-tale sign that something was amiss\".\n\nHe says managers received an anonymous tip-off from a customer pointing out that the same team kept winning with near-perfect scores, prompting an investigation.\n\nSo how were the cheats finally rumbled by the pub staff?\n\nBobby Bruen, assistant manager and quizmaster, says he devised some questions for a music round to make it highly unlikely anyone would get them all correct.\n\nHe says the team was then rumbled by Mr Hardie when he went outside and saw the players through a window looking at answers on their smartwatches, using the Shazam app to identify the songs.\n\nMr Hardie let his mother, Lynda, and sister, Lydia, have the table where the cheating team used to sit.\n\nLydia says the exposé has been \"hilarious\" although her mother feels it is a \"shame people will resort to that in a local pub quiz\".\n\n\"It spoiled it for everyone, all the regulars stopped coming.\"\n\nMr Bruen says he has been interviewed by radio stations as far away as New Zealand and Canada on the \"massive whodunnit\".\n\nAs the night draws to a close here at the pub, the losers of the latest quiz - a team called Short, Bark and Sides - get a pack of Jammie Dodgers biscuits.\n\nThe winners of the £30 bar tab have a fitting name - Agatha Quiztie.\n\nListen to the best of  BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds  and follow BBC Manchester on  Facebook ,  X , and  Instagram .

2025-11-14T22:01:26.372+00:00\n\nTitle: Record settler attacks in West Bank opening up rifts within Israel\n\nThe marks of the attack on Hamida Mosque, near Deir Istiya in the occupied West Bank, are still scattered on the ground outside.\n\nCharred furniture, lecterns and smoky curls of carpet are piled around the entrance - its guts emptied, and debris cleared, in time for Friday prayers.\n\nDozens of men arrived for the prayers in a show of defiance - their backs turned towards the scorched and blackened wall.\n\nThe imam here, Ahmad Salman, told the BBC the attack on Thursday was a message from Jewish settlers, amid a wave of settler violence across the West Bank.\n\n\"The message they want to send is that they can reach anywhere - into cities, into villages, that they can kill civilians and burn houses and mosques.\"\n\n\"I feel it in my soul,\" he said. \"It's not right to touch places of prayer, wherever they are.\"\n\nBut there was a message here, too, for Israel's regional military chief - scrawled in Hebrew on the mosque's exterior wall: \"We're not afraid of you, Avi Bluth.\"\n\nSpiralling settler attacks here over the past six weeks have triggered tough warnings from army leaders, along with a handful of arrests and investigations.\n\nBut expansionist settlers enjoy government support, which some believe is pushing the West Bank towards a dangerous confrontation.\n\nThe annual olive harvest, when Palestinians try to access their farmland, often marks a spike in violence, but the attacks this year have broken UN records.\n\nThe UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs registered more than 260 settler attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in October alone - the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006.\n\nHuman rights groups say that settler aggression towards Palestinians has risen since the Gaza War began in 2023 after the 7 October Hamas attacks. UN figures suggest that more than 3,200 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settler violence and restrictions since then.\n\nIn the past few days, there have been several attacks across the West Bank, including an assault by a large crowd of masked men on an industrial estate and Bedouin buildings near Beit Lid. Security cameras filmed them running across the hillside and through the factory gates, where they torched several trucks.  The army said they later attacked Israeli soldiers operating nearby.\n\nThe Israel police spokesman said four suspects had been arrested. Three have reportedly since been released.\n\nLast week, in the olive groves around Beita, a Reuters journalist, Raneen Sawafta, was beaten by a settler with a club as she was covering the olive harvest - a deep dent in her helmet clearly showing the force of the blows.\n\nHamad al-Jagoub abu Rabia, a volunteer with the Red Crescent in Beita, was also injured after going to help her - hit in the head with a rock and later taken to hospital.\n\n\"I never imagined a human being created by God would do this,\" he said. \"If they had an iota of humanity, they would have never done this to a woman. If it wasn't for her helmet, she could have died.\"\n\nLess than three weeks earlier, 55-year-old Afaf Abu Alia was  badly beaten with a club  as she lay cowering on the ground during a settler attack, after picking olives on farmland she rents near the village of Abu Falah. The video of her assault drew international condemnation.\n\n\"One of [the settlers] attacked me and started beating me - hitting my head, my arms and legs, and kicking my legs with their boots,\" she told the BBC. \"I fell down. I wasn't aware of what was happening, my mind went blank - I was only feeling the pain. I felt like my soul was leaving my body. The only thing I thought about was my children.\"\n\nNow recovering at home, Afaf said she was still in pain, with 20 stitches in her head, and bruises on her arms and legs that left her unable to sleep.\n\nShe said the family had been blocked from its own farmland by settlers, and that they had been renting land elsewhere to grow olives this year.\n\n\"I'd return there today if I could, I'm not afraid of them,\" Afaf said. But she also acknowledged the situation was becoming riskier.\n\n\"They weren't like this at the start of the war,\" she said. \"In this one year, they've escalated more than in all the years before.\"\n\nOne man has been arrested in connection with her assault. Arrests like this are rare, and convictions rarer still. The Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din found that, over the past two decades, more than 93% of police investigations into Israeli offences against Palestinians in the West Bank were closed with no charges filed.\n\nIsraeli forces have long been criticised by human rights groups for standing idly by during settler attacks - or even taking part in them.\n\nThis week, Israel's chief of staff said he strongly condemned the recent violence by Israeli settlers, calling it \"a red line\" and promising to \"act decisively\".\n\nThe head of the army's central command, Maj Gen Avi Bluth - the man addressed in the graffiti on Hamida Mosque - said violent acts by what he called \"anarchist fringe youth\" were \"unacceptable and extremely serious\" and must be dealt with firmly.\n\nSome hardline settlers see these comments as a betrayal.\n\nAmichai Luria, a long-time settler from Ma'ale Levona and manager of a winery in the nearby settlement of Shiloh, told me the current focus on settler violence was overblown.\n\n\"It's amazing to me how people talk about these rare occasions [when] people misbehave,\" he said. \"Oh, some people were trying to pick olives and some Jews came and bothered them. Give me a break. There are more muggings on the main street in London than there [are] here.\"\n\nI asked him about the severe beating of women and the near-daily reports of incidents in surrounding areas. He dismissed them as an \"attempt to make the Jews look bad\".\n\n\"Most of the Arabs, if they could, would follow Hamas or Hezbollah. Very, very, very few want to coexist or live in peace, and at the first opportunity they have, they're going to wipe us out,\" he said.\n\n\"The future is very simple. Hopefully the army will wake up, hopefully people will understand that we have to prepare ourselves, that they're coming for us.\"\n\nThe UN's Office of Humanitarian Affairs says that, of the 1,000 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since the Gaza War began, between 20 and 32 were killed by Israeli settlers. During the same period, it says, Palestinians killed 19 Israeli civilians.\n\nThe decision of military leaders to order action on settler violence will test discipline in an army where settlers make up a growing proportion of troops.\n\nIt also risks exposing dangerous divisions between Israel's military and political leaders.\n\nExtremist settlers say their claim to the land comes from the Bible - but their growing confidence comes from government support.\n\nSince the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and the Gaza War that followed, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has handed out more than 100,000 weapons to civilian security squads, including in West Bank settlements, and has urged Israel to formally annex the West Bank.\n\nThe government has authorised a sharp expansion of settlements, and legalised some unauthorised outposts. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n\nAnd the Defence Minister, Israel Katz, last year banned the use of administrative detention for Jewish settlers in the West Bank - reportedly against the advice of Israel's national security agency.\n\nIsrael's army is now asking Katz to reinstate that power to help curb settler violence.  Administrative detention, which allows suspects to be held for renewable six month periods without charge, is still widely used for Palestinians.\n\n\"I don't trust the army like I used to,\" Amichai Lurai told me. \"A lot of people in the army are anti-Israel from top to bottom. Trust me, the army is not unified.\"\n\nIsrael's army is currently embroiled in a legal and political scandal around  leaked video footage  allegedly showing the abuse of Palestinian detainees - a case that has pitted ultranationalist politicians against the country's security forces.\n\nAs worshippers left the Hamida Mosque after Friday prayers, Israeli activists arrived on a visit to show solidarity.  Martin Goldberg, originally from London, was one of them.\n\nI asked him about Israeli claims that attacks by settlers were overblown.\n\n\"They're very minor attacks, when it's not happening to you,\" he said. \"These attacks are not minor, they're extremely major. Everyone's trying to belittle it, [saying] oh it's just the 'weeds in the field' but it's not. And they're being supported by the government. Local councils are 100% behind them, financing them.\"\n\nMany local councils provide backing and support to outposts, but have publicly condemned the violence of some settlers there. The chairman of the West Bank Settler Council this week issued a statement supporting the Israeli army in arresting the \"anarchists\" who harmed soldiers and civilians.\n\n\"Europe, the United States, everyone in the whole world is watching the West Bank,\" said Wadi abu Awad, a civil engineer who lives in the nearby village of Turmus Aya, which has seen repeated attacks.\n\n\"We are not in a fight with the Israelis. We don't kill Israeli soldiers, we don't have any hostages. And they [settlers] are pushing us towards the corner. You know, if the cat is pushed the corner, he might become a tiger.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/weather/california-rain-flood-storm-los-angeles-forecast.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:57:49-05:00","title":"The Heaviest Rain Is Yet to Come for Southern Californians Facing a Very Wet Storm","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Southern Californians are facing a dangerous and intense storm system that brings heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and landslides, especially in areas recently burned by wildfires such as the Palisades, Eaton, and Mountain fires.

Facing a Very Wet Storm\n\nPublished: 2025-11-14T16:57:49-05:00\n\nSome residents of Southern California were under evacuation warnings on Friday as an unusually strong storm system moved through the region, bringing with it a risk for flash flooding and landslides in areas recently burned by wildfires. The wet storm brought an initial soaking of rain earlier on Friday.\n\nBut the worst is yet to come. On Saturday, forecasters expect heavier rain to raise the risk of flash flooding as the system pulls in additional moisture off the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPrecipitation intensity\n\n“The atmosphere is going to be juicier on Saturday,” said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office serving the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe Weather Service warned that the rain and strong winds will probably result in travel delays at airports, rockslides and mudslides on canyon roads, flooded roads, and swollen rivers and creeks. The weather could also potentially cause dangerous debris flows, a type of landslide that occurs when torrents of water and mud move down steep slopes.\n\nBurn scars are especially prone to debris flows, and some Los Angeles County residents, including those in areas that were burned during the Palisades and Eaton fires in January, were under evacuation warnings until Sunday. (A warning means that people should be prepared to leave quickly.) Some parts of Ventura County were also under evacuation warnings, including in the area burned by the Mountain fire late last year.\n\nThis system has two acts. The first occurred Thursday night into Friday afternoon, with Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties receiving a few inches of rain, and mostly light rain falling in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAct 2 is expected to be more significant. It was to begin late Friday night and continue through Saturday, when the most severe weather is forecast. That includes heavy rain and potentially thunderstorms that could cause flooding.\n\nEven on Friday morning, the exact details of Saturday’s forecast remained uncertain, as they have for much of this week. David Gomberg, a Weather Service meteorologist, said that the storm was pulling in a narrow band of moisture known as an atmospheric river off the Pacific Ocean. It was still unclear where that moisture would hit.\n\n“We think it will set up somewhere between San Bernardino County and Ventura County,” Mr. Gomberg said.\n\nIt is unusual for meteorologists to have this much uncertainty about a storm’s path. Mr. Gomberg said that as Friday progressed, the storm’s geographic range was likely to shrink, with the moisture’s target becoming clearer.\n\nPrecipitation will probably fall across all of Southern California through Sunday, with snow in the mountains at elevations above 8,000 feet and rain falling from the inland deserts to the coast. The most precipitation is expected at the coast.\n\nSanta Barbara County to Los Angeles County: Meteorologists said the highest rainfall totals were probable here, with three to four inches of rain in coastal and valley areas and four to eight inches in the mountains. Downtown Los Angeles could face three and a half to four inches of rain.\n\nThunderstorms could drop sudden bursts of especially heavy rain that would increase those totals in isolated spots, Mr. Thompson said.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the heaviest rain is predicted to start before sunrise on Saturday morning and continue throughout the day.\n\nOrange County to San Diego County: Rainfall totals are forecast to range from one and a half inches to three inches across coastal and valley areas and four to six inches in the mountains, with the highest totals likely in Orange and San Bernardino Counties and the lowest in San Diego County.\n\nSan Diego will see its heaviest rainfall early Saturday morning and in the afternoon, with the downtown area likely to record around two inches.\n\nThunderstorms could also bump up totals in some locations.\n\nCurrent areas because of fires or rain\n\nEvacuation order\n\nEvacuation warning\n\nHistorical fire perimeter\n\nSource: Cal Fire\n\nData as of Invalid Date Pacific time. Historical fire data is shown for the years 2019-2025 and is as of Nov. 13, 2025.\n\nBy William B. Davis and Joey K. Lee\n\nThe coastal mountains of Southern California, from the Santa Monica Mountains to the San Bernardino Mountains, are perfectly oriented to wring the moisture out of the atmospheric river and produce heavy rain.\n\n“The moisture will hit those mountains dead on,” said Park Williams, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Those mountains act as a wall, and the water slides down the mountains and then it goes into the city.”\n\nIn one chain of events, the heavy rain pouring down the mountains and into the urban areas will cause traffic delays on roads, scattered flash flooding, and minor mudslides and debris flows.\n\nIf the system aligns over Los Angeles County on Saturday and stalls over the region for a prolonged period of time, it could cause dangerous debris flows in the burn scars from the Palisades and Eaton fires and others from recent years.\n\nBurn scars are susceptible to debris flows from heavy rain because wildfire flames have destroyed the vegetation and cooked the soil. The debris flows start as a flood that picks up sediment as it moves quickly across a hardened landscape without any vegetation to stop it.\n\n"}]}
