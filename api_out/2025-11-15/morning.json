This country just declared it a national security threat \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iceland’s relatively mild climate is shaped by a crucial network of currents that winds its away around the Atlantic Ocean transporting heat northward — without it, the island would be much icier and stormier. As evidence mounts these currents  could be on course for collapse , Iceland’s government has made the unusual move of designating the risk a national security threat, prompting a a high-level response into how to prepare for this “existential threat.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our climate, economy and security are deeply tied to the stability of the ocean currents around us,” said Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Iceland’s Minister for Environment, Energy and Climate.\n \n\n   \n  The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation — known as the AMOC — is a looping system of currents that works like a giant conveyor belt, pulling warm water from the Southern Hemisphere and tropics to the Northern Hemisphere, where it cools, sinks and flows back south.\n \n\n   \n  When scientists are asked which potential climate impact terrifies them most, the collapse of the AMOC is often top of the list.\n \n\n   \n  A growing body of research points to the AMOC slowing down, as higher global temperatures disrupt the delicate balance of heat and salinity on which its strength relies. The science is still unsettled on the likelihood and timing of any collapse, but some studies have projected it could be on course to happen  this century .\n \n\n   \n  A shutdown of the AMOC “cannot be considered a low likelihood risk anymore in view of the evolving science over the past years,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer and climatologist who has studied the AMOC at Potsdam University in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  The  impacts would be catastrophic  — ushering in huge global weather and climate shifts, including rising sea levels in parts of the US and Europe, disrupted monsoon systems affecting countries in Asia and Africa, and a winter deep freeze in Europe, with sea ice potentially creeping southward as far as the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  Iceland “would be close to the center of a serious regional cooling,” meaning the country could be surrounded by sea ice, Rahmstorf told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an “an existential threat,” Jóhannsson told CNN. The AMOC regulates Iceland’s weather, and its collapse could devastate infrastructure, transport and vital industries including fishing, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jóhannsson briefed the government on the latest science after  research  published in August raised “grave concerns” about the AMOC’s future stability. In September, Iceland’s National Security Council designated the current’s potential collapse as a national security risk, marking the first time a climate impact has received this designation in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The decision “reflects the seriousness of the issue and ensures that the matter gets the attention it deserves,” Jóhannsson said. In practice, the designation will mean a high-level, coordinated government response to understand the threat and work out how to prevent and mitigate the worst consequences, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rahmstorf commended Iceland for its decision and said other countries should follow suit. The impacts of an AMOC collapse would be felt across the globe. Scientists are trying to understand the full range of potential impacts on societies and economies, but research has pointed to  destroyed crops  and  catastrophic flooding .\n \n\n   \n  Iceland’s decision marks a shift in how the country understands climate risks, Jóhannsson said.\n \n\n   \n  “What we do know is that the current climate might change so drastically that it could become impossible for us to adapt,” he said. “In short, this is not just a scientific concern — it’s a matter of national survival and security.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/middleeast/iran-seize-tanker-singapore-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:18:00-05:00","title":"Iran confirms seizure of tanker carrying petrochemical cargo","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran confirmed that its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seized the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Talara in Gulf waters, which was carrying a cargo of high-sulfur gasoil from Sharjah, UAE, to Singapore.

The controversy has sparked a crisis in the BBC, triggering the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to UK network GB News, Trump acknowledged the apology he received from the BBC, saying “they wrote me a nice letter.”\n \n\n   \n  “’We apologize,’ but when you say it’s unintentional, I guess if it’s unintentional, you don’t apologize,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The president told GB News he is not looking to get into lawsuits but painted the move as essential to prevent similar mishaps in the future.\n \n\n   \n  “This was so egregious,” he said, “If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people… I’d like to find out why they did it.”\n \n\n   \n    Plans to call the UK PM\n \n\n   \n  In the BBC’s edit, on an edition of the TV show Panorama, different parts of Trump’s speech from the day of the January 6 storming of the US Capitol were spliced together, creating the impression Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  He told GB News: “I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement.”\n \n\n   \n  The president said Friday he plans to call UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the coming days to discuss the spat with the BBC, claiming the prime minister is “very embarrassed” about the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Should Trump proceed with his case and win it would impose enormous financial burdens on the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is primarily license-fee funded, meaning anyone watching live television in the UK or who accesses BBC content online must pay a compulsory charge. The BBC’s income is further supplemented by commercial subsidiaries.\n \n\n   \n  According to the  BBC’s most recent operational report,  in the year ending March 2025 the BBC’s total income was £5.9 billion (more than $7.5 billion.)

But this process will not be simple. In the US, the president will be expected to present a high standard of compelling evidence proving his reputation was materially damaged because of the BBC’s edit.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuking Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s grounds to reject Trump’s defamation claim, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip was never meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Billy Stockwell and Laura Sharman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/china/china-japan-taiwan-takaichi-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:04:00-04:00","title":"China warns citizens against Japan travel as Taiwan spat escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has issued a travel advisory warning its citizens against visiting Japan in response to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s controversial remarks that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival.

escalates \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:04 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has warned its citizens against traveling to Japan as it escalates a backlash over comments by the country’s prime minister about the island of Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The dictum is Beijing’s most substantive retaliation yet to Sanae Takaichi’s remarks. Even as it may be more symbolic than anything, the move suggests Beijing is willing to wield its economic heft to press geopolitical points, a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  Recent “blatantly provocative remarks on Taiwan” have “further damaged the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges… creating additional risks to the safety and security of Chinese citizens in Japan,” a statement published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The ministry and its missions “remind Chinese citizens to refrain from visiting Japan for the time being,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Following the announcement, a number of Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern on Saturday published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Beijing is its latest show of outrage in a  roughly week-long row  after Takaichi, in response to a question in Japan’s parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  China’s Ministry of Defense on Friday separately warned that Japan would “suffer a crushing defeat” if it dared to intervene militarily in the Taiwan Strait.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  The travel advisory follows official protest from both sides related to the incident – with each country summoning the other’s ambassador – and a surge of vitriolic backlash against Takaichi from within China, where nationalist, anti-Japanese sentiment has been on the rise in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The falling-out comes less than two weeks after Takaichi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for the first time on the sidelines of an international summit and agreed to pursue constructive, stable ties.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A heavy price’\n \n\n   \n  The backlash was kicked off by China’s Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian, who last Saturday shared a news article about Takaichi’s remarks and commented “the dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  State media has since published a barrage of scathing commentaries and editorials, while rampant social media discussion has disparaged Takaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  A commentary from the People’s Liberation Army Daily published Saturday attacked Takaichi and said if Japan intervened militarily in the Taiwan Strait, China would give it a “head-on blow.” A PLA-affiliated X account also circulated comments translated into Japanese warning Japan would “pay a heavy price” in such a case.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo on Friday summoned China’s ambassador to Japan to protest Xue’s “highly inappropriate remarks” and demand Beijing take “appropriate actions,” its foreign ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing had a day prior summoned Japan’s ambassador to China, in a meeting where Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong said Takaichi’s comments had “seriously damaged the political foundation of China-Japan relations,” and slammed Japan for not retracting them.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Friday said there was no need to retract Takaichi’s comments, stressing that they were made within the context of a discussion on an “existential crisis situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Separately on Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important not only for Japan’s security but also for the stability of the international community.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Takaichi said her remarks were “hypothetical” and that she would refrain from making similar comments in parliament again.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, which is widely seen as aiming to establish itself as the dominant power in the region, looks warily at the American alliance with Japan when it comes to its own regional security and ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has called for closer security ties with the US and last month moved to accelerate the country’s defense build-up, but like previous Japanese prime ministers she must balance the country’s close economic ties to China.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Junko Ogura contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/middleeast/gaza-high-school-graduations-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:00","title":"Bittersweet Moments of Joy as Gaza Celebrates High School Graduations Without Schools","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the midst of an ongoing humanitarian crisis, over 56,000 high school students in Gaza celebrate their graduations despite the near-total destruction of their education system since October 2023.

   4:52 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Doaa Musallem’s high school grades were so good that she got a congratulatory call from the Palestinian Minister of Education.\n \n\n   \n  But for the 18-year-old, the celebration was bittersweet.\n \n\n   \n  Like some 56,000 other students from Gaza’s class of 2025, the last two years of her education have been nearly completely disrupted by Israel’s  war in Gaza , which has killed almost 19,000 school age children, made orphans out of thousands of others, and all but decimated the enclave’s formal  education system .\n \n\n   \n  “Our happiness is incomplete because our supporter and the pillar of the house is not here,” she told CNN, speaking of her father, who was absent from the celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Doaa’s father Bassam Musallam was critically wounded by shrapnel in November 2023, when an Israeli strike hit a neighboring house and killed his friend in central Gaza, the family told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Musallam was evacuated to Egypt for medical treatment in April 2024 and has been there since, missing many milestones in his daughter’s life, including her exam results, which have gone viral.\n \n\n   \n  When she sent her father a photo of the celebrations, standing proudly next to her brother in her graduation gown and cap in front of a bright yellow balloon sign that read: “Congratulations,” she felt like the entire enclave was celebrating with her.\n \n\n   \n  “You are a hero,” Palestinian Minister of Education Amjad Barham told Doaa over the phone as he called to congratulate her on graduating high school and earning the highest grade of any student in Gaza, at 99.7%.\n \n\n   \n  Doaa’s joyful scene was emulated throughout Gaza Thursday, in bright moments that have been rare over the past two years. As the education ministry announced the grades for tens of thousands of high school students like Doaa, there was a buzz in the air as Palestinians set off fireworks and embraced in song and dance.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud Elyan, a recent graduate who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to central Gaza, stood at a crowded dessert shop in his hometown with a grin on his face.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy beyond words,” he told Palestinian state TV. “I am here to buy desserts and hand them out to people because it’s been a long time that people haven’t seen desserts after two years of war and displacement.”\n \n\n   \n  For others, graduation day is a reminder of that suffering.\n \n\n   \n  Student Doha Nazmi Abu Dalal, who had been displaced in Deir el Balah, central Gaza, achieved a near perfect GPA. But she was killed less than a month before she could see how her hard work had paid off. Abu Dalal, along with 17 members of her family, was killed in an Israeli strike on October 29, weeks after the ceasefire was implemented, according to hospital authorities.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘scholasticide’\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since October 7, 2023, has decimated the education system in Gaza, leaving it on the brink of collapse, according to UNICEF, and prompting accusations from UN experts of a  scholasticide , or the systematic destruction of a country’s education.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has repeatedly said Hamas uses schools and universities as part of its infrastructure to store weapons or as command centers. It has not addressed the scholasticide accusation directly.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously told CNN it seeks to minimize civilian harm while Hamas “cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes.”\n \n\n   \n  Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed over 97% of schools in Gaza, according to UNICEF, leaving hundreds of thousands of children with limited access to in-person learning.\n \n\n   \n  At least 18,591 school age students have been killed and 27,216 injured over the course of the war, according to the Palestinian education ministry figures. In addition, some 792 educational staff have been killed and 3,251 injured.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hassan Ali Radwan is one of the Palestinian students who experienced the loss of one of his loved ones when his cousin and study buddy was killed during the war. Like his classmates, Al-Hassan had to navigate the challenges of online education amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a hard time with internet connection, the lack of electricity and water as well as displacement and most importantly food,” Al-Hassan told WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, at a shelter for the displaced in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza on Thursday, where he and his friends had gathered to celebrate his graduation.\n \n\n   \n  In central Gaza, another graduate, Dima, who only gave her first name to state media, was celebrating with her family after overcoming trauma attached to her studies.\n \n\n   \n  She said she suffered minor injuries from an Israeli strike that happened during her first private math lesson – at a sporting club – after the war had started.\n \n\n   \n  “I stopped studying for some time because I was scared,” she said. “But I eventually had to keep going because we only get to be highschoolers once in a lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n    Going to university, without the campus\n \n\n   \n  Gaza’s 56,000 new graduates are ready for college, according to the education ministry. But there are hardly any campuses to attend.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli attacks have completely destroyed  63 university buildings  over the past two years, according to the ministry.\n \n\n   \n  And resources are scarce.  Educational supplies, like stationery, backpacks, and other resources, have been  “impossible” to bring into the enclave, despite the implementation of the October 10 ceasefire, because they are not deemed as “lifesaving humanitarian aid,” UNICEF said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some students and parents are riding the high of Thursday’s graduations, and are hopeful that Gaza’s schools and universities will soon be rebuilt.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 92% of all education facilities will require either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation to become functional again, according to a recent  UNICEF statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the pain and ache in Gaza, we want to be happy and get over our wounds,” Dima’s father said. “Students need to be back in classrooms as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, others are calling for mechanisms to help pursue college scholarships and study abroad, rather than going back online to study.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not life, they (Israel) destroyed our schools and universities,” recent graduate Mohamed Bilal Abu Faraj told Palestinian state media on Thursday after handing out desserts at a shelter.\n \n\n   \n  “Open up the border,” he added, nodding to the continued siege on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  For Doaa, her father’s injury has fueled her interest in pursuing a higher education in nursing.\n \n\n   \n  She too, hopes to continue her education abroad, where she yearns to reunite with her father once again.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Abeer Salman contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/weather/southern-california-storm-flooding-risk-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-05:00","title":"Multi-day storm threatens flooding and mudslides in Southern California: What to expect and when","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A multi-day storm driven by an atmospheric river is bringing heavy rainfall to Southern California, particularly impacting the Los Angeles area.

Waxman, Taylor Ward, Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:49 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A strong Pacific storm is bringing soaking rain to Southern California, increasing the risk of life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders are in effect for “vulnerable properties” within the Palisades, Hurst and Sunset burn scars, according to a Friday news release from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n \n\n   \n  The threat is tied to a multi-day storm that began Thursday in northern and central California. Widespread  rainfall totals  of 1 to 2 inches fell along the coast into Friday morning, with isolated amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the coastal mountain ranges.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco received nearly an inch and a half of rain Thursday, almost  75% of November’s average. November marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  The flood threat has intensified since then as an  atmospheric river  feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The first round of rainfall soaked the same region Friday, but Saturday’s rain is expected to be heavier, with rainfall rates likely reaching an inch per hour at times.\n \n\n   \n  This second round of rain has the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Friday night into Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through Saturday evening.

Now the mom is in jail as police investigate her disappearance \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Gordon Terrelonge says it has been more than six months since he has seen or heard from his 10-year-old daughter, Gabrielle Terrelonge.\n \n\n   \n  He lost touch with Gabrielle and her mom, Passha Davis, this past spring after a dispute with Davis in Kissimmee, Florida, but said he expected his family would eventually reunite.\n \n\n   \n  However, when Terrelonge discovered in online jail records in late October that Davis had been arrested in the South Florida city of Margate, he contacted Margate police to ask who was caring for Gabrielle.\n \n\n   \n  It was then, Gordon Terrelonge says, that he and police learned at the same time: Gabrielle was missing.\n \n\n   \n  “My life has been hell,” Terrelonge told CNN this week. “This is the longest I’ve gone without seeing her.”\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle was not with Davis when the mom, after being accused of shoplifting, was arrested October 17, and Davis still was in a Broward County jail when Terrelonge called, police said. That call sparked an investigation by Florida police and  the FBI , who are  seeking the public’s help  in finding Gabrielle.\n \n\n   \n  As far as investigators know, the girl was last seen with Davis on June 30 taking a Greyhound bus from Broward County to Orlando, Margate police Maj. Al Banatte said. A witness on the bus saw them arrive at the Florida Mall, and “the manifest and tickets also corroborate this information,” Banatte said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis, who was re-arrested this month in connection with Gabrielle’s disappearance, told police she doesn’t know where her daughter is and “that she should be with her father,” according to the arrest affidavit. But Margate police say Terrelonge last saw Gabrielle in Kissimmee in April – when investigators believe Davis left that city with the child – and that Terrelonge is cooperating with the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle’s disappearance has left her family reeling and desperate for answers about her whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  “This is very devastating for me,” Gabrielle’s paternal grandmother, Jonett Vassel, told CNN over the phone as she hung flyers in Orlando with her granddaughter’s picture on them. “I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I’m fasting, I’m praying. I’m still trusting God, because I’m a Christian, so I’m trusting that he will bring her home.”\n \n\n   \n  Police and court records paint a picture of an unstable living situation for both Davis and Gabrielle since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Davis was homeless and suffered from “mental illness and substance abuse issues,” police said in her November arrest affidavit. Yet Gabrielle was in Davis’ care, and they moved from city to city in Florida last year and parts of this year, staying with family members, at hotels and even sleeping in a car, Margate police said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ October arrest came after she was accused of shoplifting at a Dollar Tree in Margate. The store declined to prosecute, but police arrested her on charges of resisting a police officer without violence and providing false identification while being lawfully detained, records show.\n \n\n   \n  She posted bail on October 31 but was re-arrested by Margate police on November 4 and charged with child neglect in Gabrielle’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Davis “failed to provide any reasonable explanation as to the whereabouts of her minor child” and “failed to provide adequate services and supervision necessary to maintain her physical and mental health,” police allege in a court document.\n \n\n   \n  During Davis’ November 5 bond hearing in the child neglect case, a defense attorney told a Broward County judge that Davis had told him “she is innocent of these charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “She’s wanting to fight these allegations,” the defense attorney said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis is represented by the Broward County public defender’s office, court records show, and CNN has sought comment from that office. Davis is being held at a county jail with bond set at $100,000.\n \n\n   \n  In an arraignment Monday relating to the first arrest, Davis told a judge she had mental illness. The judge ordered that Davis be evaluated for competency by November 26.\n \n\n   \n    A rocky living situation\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle was last enrolled in school in Port St. Lucie, Florida, when she and Davis lived with Gabrielle’s paternal aunt there from April 2024 to November 2024, Banatte said. Sometime after Thanksgiving last year, Davis and Gabrielle left the aunt’s house for a Motel 6, Margate police said.\n \n\n   \n  This March, they were found sleeping in a car in Broward County, Margate police said. The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) intervened and helped Davis and Gabrielle travel to Orlando, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DCF to inquire about the encounter, including why the agency helped them go to Orlando, whether DCF was aware of Gabrielle’s school enrollment status, and whether the state considered removing the child from Davis’ custody.\n \n\n   \n  Between mid-March and April, Davis and the child were with Gordon Terrelonge in the Orlando and Kissimmee areas, Margate police said. But after the April dispute in Kissimmee, Terrelonge said, he never saw Gabrielle again.\n \n\n   \n    A father’s desperate plea\n \n\n   \n  Terrelonge described Gabrielle as a joyful child who is adventurous and loves nature, coloring, wearing princess costumes and having tea parties.\n \n\n   \n  He said Gabrielle and Davis shared a close bond, and even when times were tough, Gabrielle preferred to be with her mother over anyone else.  Terrelonge said his attempts to get full legal custody of Gabrielle were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  He said he had lost touch with Davis and Gabrielle in the past, but they would always find their way back to each other within a few months.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always in and out,” Terrelonge said of Davis. “But I always end up finding them.”\n \n\n   \n  Terrelonge said he has followed all leads for possible places where Gabrielle could be. He said he wants to believe that Gabrielle is safe, but he worries that someone could have harmed her.\n \n\n   \n  “If anyone knows anything, please come forward and let us know,” Terrelonge said. “You may save my child’s life.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Taylor Galgano and Lily Hautau contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-maduro-removal-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump likely to face long military commitment and chaos if he ousts Maduro in Venezuela, experts say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Experts caution that if President Donald Trump attempts to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro through military strikes, the effort could lead to significant chaos, including military takeovers, civil conflict, or a rise in other Chavismo-aligned dictators.

\nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has said he believes Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s days are numbered, and that land strikes inside Venezuela are possible.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the US doesn’t currently have the military assets in place to launch a largescale operation to remove Maduro from power, though Trump has approved covert action within Venezuela,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n  But if Trump did order strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, he could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency, according to experts, as well as political backlash at home for a president who promised to avoid costly entanglements overseas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Trump received a briefing earlier this week to review updated options for military action inside Venezuela, a concept the White House has been  weighing . The administration had not made a decision on whether to launch strikes, CNN reported, though the US military has moved more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded Operation Southern Spear in an announcement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The concentration of military assets and threats of further attacks beyond the  ongoing drug boat campaign  have served to increase pressure on Maduro, with administration officials saying he needs to leave office while arguing that he’s closely tied to the Tren de Aragua gang and leading drug trafficking efforts.\n \n\n   \n  But if Maduro does flee Venezuela or is killed out in a targeted strike, experts worry about a military takeover of the country or the boosting of another dictator similar to Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  There are other members of the Venezuelan Chavismo, the leftist political ideology of former Cuban leader Hugo Chavez that Maduro has championed, who could take the reins and subject the country to even harsher rule, experts and former officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Maduro has said something to the effect of, ‘You want to get rid of me? You think things will get better?’ It is something to consider because Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo, and someone else could usurp power instead of the opposition with the backing of the military,” said Juan Gonzalez, a resident fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute who was a former Biden administration official focused on the region.\n \n\n   \n  Another possibility would be a military takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “If the military is still cohesive, and I don’t think we see any evidence it is not, they will not collapse because there is a challenge to or an ouster of Maduro,” said John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser in his first term. “They will follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, whose inner circle is made up of both civilians and military officers who are often in competition with each other, is known to have tight control over his administration and has helped stabilize competing factions. External forces, like Colombian insurgent groups who regularly operate from Venezuela or criminal syndicates linked to cocaine, gold and mineral trafficking further complicate the picture.\n \n\n   \n  Were Maduro to disappear, these pulls could tear the nation apart – descending into a potential civil war, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium,” said a Western diplomat who has spent years in Venezuela, asking to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss with the press. “Everyone knows he’s been politically dead since last year’s election, but if he leaves there’s nobody who can maintain the status quo … so they all close ranks around him.”\n \n\n   \n    Opposition Figures\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration may hope that Venezuelan opposition figures would be able to step into a power vacuum created by the removal of Maduro, something that the first Trump administration considered as it propped up Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. That first Trump administration officially recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela in 2019, but a failed coup attempt that year meant he never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  One current Venezuelan opposition group led by Edmundo Gonzalez, who ran for president last year in an election that  the US said Maduro lost , says it has a 100-hour plan to transition the power of Venezuela’s government from Maduro to Gonzalez. But experts say that they would be unable to succeed in the short-term or in the long-term without sustained US support – and potentially US boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible. There is no way to guarantee their safety or ability to govern without the US providing security,”  Juan Gonzalez said. “Everyone is viewing removing Maduro as the end but it’s really just the beginning of what would be a long, drawn-out process.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have also said that Edmuondo Gonzalez, who is currently residing in Spain, is the rightful leader of Venezuela, based on the results of last year’s election. The US has provided limited support to another Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who went into hiding in the country after the election. The assistance includes support, like gaining access to secure communication capabilities, former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  But in order to keep any of the potential opposition leaders in power the type of support needed from the US would go beyond providing a secure device – there would need to be assistance in reconstructing the army, unfreezing Venezuelan government funds and training their police force, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition’s enemies inside Venezuela are not limited to Maduro himself, which is why such sustained outside support is seen as a necessity, experts said. The opposition would face hostilities from the Venezuelan military; pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos; the National Liberation Army (known as the ELN), which is a Colombian guerilla group that currently has safe haven in the country; and other active criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how much support Trump would be willing to give any opposition leader who seeks to take the presidency from Maduro. But that support would need to be sustained, officials said, to fend off a failed state.\n \n\n   \n  Such an extended US military involvement runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump backs away from a potential opportunity to oust Maduro now, some believe it could be viewed as a lost opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump is calling Maduro a narcoterrorist and a drug trafficker, and has assembled a huge armada. If he backs down now and Maduro survives, there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine’ talk and the idea of being supreme in our own hemisphere.” said Elliott Abrams, a former senior State Department official in Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n    Entanglements\n \n\n   \n  Even while some say that displacing Maduro could be done without US troops on the ground for an extended period, they say that the US commitment following any kinetic strikes needs to be long-lasting or else the effort could easily fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “If the force is decisive it can disband a full army. But whatever is done cannot be done with a short-term perspective. The use of force needs to create a result and be connected to a political solution with US support, and planning for that support for 5-10 years,” said a regional diplomat.\n \n\n   \n  The Maduro regime is propped up in different ways by Russia, China and Cuba. Experts worry that if US strikes hit assets of those nations the conflict could quickly escalate. While it is unlikely that any of those nations would send their troops to the region to defend against US strikes, it is possible that the effect of US strikes inside Venezuela could be blunted by the support those countries provide to the regime.\n \n\n   \n  All three nations have invested in the Venezuelan regime and have instruments that they could bring to bear to prevent Maduro’s ouster, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  This is something that has happened in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2019, the opposition thought that the Cubans had uncovered what they were trying to do with their coup attempt and believe that they made moves to undermine their efforts,” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  Further expanding the problem could be a move by Maduro to hit US assets in the region – before the US makes any move to directly oust him.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a chance that if Maduro thinks he is going down he might make a move to hit something the US cares about, such as oil platforms in the Caribbean Sea. It could be a gamble he may be willing to take that would harm US interests in the region,” said Henry Ziemer, a regional expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Publicly the Trump administration continues to point to its buildup of military assets in Latin America as supremely focused on counter-drug operations – not an ouster of Maduro. Experts have also  previously told CNN  that the assembled hardware and troops aren’t enough for a full-scale invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Still, when asked earlier this month if the US might get into a war with Venezuela, Trump gave an ambiguous answer, saying: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/us/ice-federal-agents-immigration-force","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"As ICE escalates its tactics, are federal agents truly ‘untouchable’ in the eyes of the law?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article investigates growing concerns that federal immigration agents, particularly under the Trump administration, are being granted unchecked immunity from accountability for the use of excessive or deadly force.

\n        5:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Mere hours after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer  shot a suspect  last month – wounding a member of the arrest team in the process – the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles effectively exonerated the agent who opened fire.\n \n\n   \n  “PSA: A vehicle is a deadly weapon,” First Assistant US Attorney Bill Essayli wrote in  a social media post.  “Using it against law enforcement justifies their use of deadly force in self-defense.”\n \n\n   \n  Essayli alleged the man who was shot had rammed his car into vehicles driven by immigration agents trying to arrest him, “causing agents to worry for their safety,” and prompting one of them to discharge his weapon, wounding the man and, inadvertently, a deputy US marshal.\n \n\n   \n  Under policy, immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. Still, federal law enforcement agencies have historically spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent’s use of force was appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  But after recent high-profile use of force encounters, federal officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents, raising questions about whether previously enshrined mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been all but abandoned in President Donald Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely due to Trump’s installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI – the agencies traditionally tasked with investigating and prosecuting suspected civil rights violations by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  And since many immigration agents typically  do not wear body cameras  — a point of contention that has at times led to intense friction among the enforcers themselves — there has often been scant ability to verify competing narratives following use of force incidents.\n \n\n   \n  “If it’s purely the ICE agent’s word against someone else, game over,” one federal law enforcement source said. “Unless it’s beyond egregious and on film, they are basically untouchable.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Allowed to do whatever the hell they want’\n \n\n   \n  In August, Trump himself effectively gave American law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances. In announcing  the federal takeover of the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department , the president lamented images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers.\n \n\n   \n  “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”’ and they can hit real hard,”  Trump said . “And they’re standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything.”\n \n\n   \n  “But now,” he added,﻿ “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”\n \n\n   \n  A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump’s immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN. Many are concerned DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security have grown less willing to objectively scrutinize the actions of agents and ensure their rigorous adherence to the Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Following  a recent purge of career DOJ employees , sources also worry that federal prosecutors responsible for evaluating the conduct of agents will choose not to investigate questionable incidents for fear of running afoul of Trump’s political priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a zero chance of an (immigration) agent being criminally charged with this administration,” said one senior DOJ lawyer who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They must be held accountable’\n \n\n   \n  While the Justice Department has vociferously defended the actions of immigration agents, state and local officials in some jurisdictions have pushed back, threatening to find ways of holding accountable federal agents accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law,”  Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi  said in a statement last month before Trump called off a planned surge of immigration agents to her San Francisco district.\n \n\n   \n  The former House speaker was backed up by the local district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, who said on social media, “If a federal agent breaks the law, they must be held accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago has been another flashpoint, where clashes between agents and the public have spurred numerous allegations of excessive use of force.\n \n\n   \n  A Presbyterian minister said he was praying outside a suburban ICE facility during demonstrations there last month when he was  struck in the head by pepper balls . Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the protesters had blocked an ICE vehicle from leaving the facility and threw rocks and bottles and launched fireworks at agents – a claim the pastor disputed.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents have also faced scrutiny in the Windy City after text messages  appeared to show an agent bragging  about his marksmanship skills after shooting a driver accused of ramming the agent’s vehicle five times.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the city, the  mayor of the suburb of Evanston  announced two investigations after federal agents were filmed striking a person during an arrest. DHS said the agents were conducting an immigration enforcement operation when another vehicle struck theirs, and that a “hostile crowd” gathered around the agents.\n \n\n   \n  City officials were “thinking through options, including going to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, or potentially communicating with our state’s attorney to figure out the right way to demand justice for our residents who were assaulted,” Mayor Daniel Biss, a Democrat running for Congress, said.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to federal activity in his state,  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker , a Democrat, signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to “create a detailed record” of agents’ actions. In doing so, the governor said the federal government was “pushing the boundaries of their authority.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once this all ends, I believe there will be people of good faith who will review what the Commission has recorded and will demand answers and accountability,” Pritzker said.\n \n\n   \n  The police chief of Durango, Colorado, has asked state authorities to investigate an incident last month where a federal officer was seen on video appearing to place a protester who had confronted him in a chokehold and shove her down an embankment.\n \n\n   \n  No known charges have been filed against the protester, who  told The Colorado Sun  the encounter left her with pain in her head, back and neck.\n \n\n   \n  “It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,” Chief Brice Current  told The New York Times .\n \n\n   \n  The  Colorado Bureau of Investigation  “will investigate whether there were state criminal law violations during the incident,” it said. Like other states, Colorado law requires that use of force by law enforcement officers must be reasonable and appropriate to a particular situation.\n \n\n   \n    Immunity claims dubious, experts say\n \n\n   \n  Threats of possible prosecution by state and local officials have come with the ire of Trump political appointees.\n \n\n   \n  “The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,” Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche  wrote on X .  \n \n\n   \n  White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller echoed that, directly addressing federal agents on Fox News, saying, “You have federal immunity in he conduct of your duties. And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony.”\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say Miller’s claim of absolutely immunity is dubious.  US criminal law  allows for the prosecution of federal and local officers who violate someone’s civil rights, including by using excessive force.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s true that federal officers have overwhelmingly broad protection when they’re carrying out their official duties,” said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “But it’s ludicrous to suggest that a federal officer who breaks state or federal law can’t ever be held accountable for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts also note the Justice Department isn’t handcuffed in policing federal agents – just that it now lacks the will to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “It is, to be clear, wrong on its face,” CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center,  wrote in his newsletter, “One First,”  of Miller’s comments. The federal government retains the power to prosecute federal officers, Vladeck wrote, even if the Trump administration “is wholly uninterested” in doing so.\n \n\n   \n  As for the states, “There may be political reasons why local or state prosecutors will be wary of bringing such cases,” Vladeck said. “But … the relevant law is far more permissive when it comes to the ability to hold federal officers accountable than Stephen Miller would have you believe.”\n \n\n   \n    Clash over body cams exacerbates the issue\n \n\n   \n  While numerous viral bystander videos have surfaced depicting heated encounters between immigration agents and members of the public, one critical tool often used to identify potential wrongdoing by police officers isn’t widely used in the immigration space: body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The topic of body cameras has at times caused friction between immigration agents and FBI agents assigned to assist with enforcement efforts, two law enforcement sources familiar with the situation previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  While FBI agents have worn body cameras during joint arrest operations per their agency’s policy, some immigration agents not wearing body cameras have expressed concern to their counterparts about having their tactics recorded, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  During one heated exchange, immigration agents who did not want to be captured on body camera footage refused to invite FBI agents along for an arrest operation, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, US District Court Judge Sara Ellis has ordered that agents to wear and use body cameras during confrontations there – a decision the Trump administration is now appealing. Ellis expressed frustration during a hearing last week, indicating that she believed administration officials were being misleading about the safety concerns surrounding protests at an ICE facility and immigration raids in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have insisted that  federal agents are facing unprecedented levels of attack . DHS says it has observed “a 1,000% increase in assaults against ICE officers.”\n \n\n   \n  While instances of violence directed at immigration officers have been documented, legal experts say there must be a distinction between actions they take in self-defense and the questionable, aggressive tactics agents have used against protesters and suspects.\n \n\n   \n  “If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped),” wrote Walter Olson, senior legal fellow at  the libertarian Cato Institute .\n \n\n   \n  At stake, he said, is a possible shift in culture among immigration officers who may now believe they can do no wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “If the agents are hearing a persistent message from their higher-ups of ‘you’re immune no matter what you do,’” Olson says, “it’s up to the rest of us to disabuse them of that error.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/travel/travel-news-most-beautiful-village-france","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"France is the world’s favorite country to visit, but this is the village the French like best","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France remains the world's top tourist destination, with 100 million visitors in 2022, and is celebrated for its rich food culture, including world-renowned cheeses and iconic bread.

the world’s favorite country to visit, but this is the village the French like best \n       \n  By Maureen O'Hare, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This week in travel: The world’s best cheese and plenty of delicious bread to pair with it, another Italian town offering sweet deals to new residents, plus a medieval village in France that earns top scores from the French.\n \n\n   \n    France’s favorite village\n \n\n   \n  France has for some years been the  world’s most visited country , with a record 100 million international tourists going there last year to enjoy its culture, food and scenery. In 2022, a Belgian man even cycled 870 miles just to taste a  very special croissant  in Nice.\n \n\n   \n  But which destination in France is a favorite among the French? Earlier this year, viewers of the TV show  “Le Village Préféré des Français 2025”  chose Saint Antoine l’Abbaye as France’s favorite village for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  So what’s the appeal? This medieval village with cobbled streets and a stunning abbey is tucked away among green rolling hills between Grenoble and Lyon in the southeastern department of Isère. Vercors Regional Natural Park is on the village’s doorstep and the whole place bustles with performers, music, shows and stalls for the medieval festival held each year in the first week of August.\n \n\n   \n  The hanging cliffside houses of Pont-en-Royans are 14 miles away and the town of Saint-Marcellin, famous for its delicate creamy cheese, is just an eight-mile drive.\n \n\n   \n    The world’s best cheese and Germany’s best bread\n \n\n   \n  France is rightly celebrated for its cheeses, from Comté to Camembert, but it was an aged Swiss Gruyère that was anointed the finest on the planet at the World Cheese Awards in Switzerland on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Three cheeses on, we could still taste it,” was the conclusion of English judge Perry Wakeman, describing its “fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 5,200 cheeses from 46 countries were gathered for the judging at Bern’s Festhalle venue, the pageant queens growing ever more pungent as the day wore on. CNN was there for all the  sights and smells .\n \n\n   \n  Moving from cheese to bread, the iconic French baguette has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as “250 grams of magic and perfection,” but all is not well in this world of flour and yeast. Even though UNESCO has deemed the baguette an essential cultural icon, France’s bread consumption is plummeting, with the daily trip to the boulangerie a disappearing way of life. Here’s how the  humble bread baton  is facing its uncertain future.\n \n\n   \n  France isn’t the only European country whose loaves have received UNESCO heritage status, however. German bread culture made the Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2015 and the country has more than 3,200 officially recognized types of bread. A nutty little number named Nussbrot was named Germany’s  bread of the year  for 2025.\n \n\n   \n    New life in the Old World\n \n\n   \n  Debra and Eric Stillwell, both in their 60s, relocated from Burbank, California, to  France’s Dordogne Valley  five years ago. The medieval towns, castles and landscapes were what lured them, Eric tells CNN.\n \n\n   \n  As retirees, they find the cost of living easier on their budget. “Everybody thinks that Americans living in France are all rich, and that’s not true,” says Eric. “Our house cost 70,000 euros… We aren’t rich.”\n \n\n   \n  Next door in Italy,   the picturesque village of Radicondoli, in Tuscany, has a relocation plan  offering up to $23,000  to anyone willing to buy and live in one of its vacant homes, along with   an extra roughly $7,000 in   contributions towards expenses like heating and transport.\n \n\n   \n    A seafood feast in Marseille\n \n\n   \n  Actor Tony Shalhoub is on a mission to find the world’s best, most surprising food items for under $10. That money nets him a seafood feast in the French port city of Marseille. Watch the final two episodes of CNN Original Series “ Tony Shalhoub Breaking Bread ,” beginning Saturday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CNN and stream the entire series next day for subscribers of  CNN All Access .\n \n\n   \n    In case you missed it\n \n\n   \n  The US government shutdown is over.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what travelers need to know about  Thanksgiving flights .\n \n\n   \n  There’s a  dolphin  living in the Venice canals.\n \n\n   \n  And pressure is growing to release  penguins  “trapped” in London.\n \n\n   \n  She arrived in New York anticipating a movie moment.\n \n\n   \n  Then she met the  man of her dreams .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/style/dave-celebrity-restaurant-polaroid-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:50:00-04:00","title":"How Davé Became the Ultimate Celebrity Hotspot","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Davé, a Chinese restaurant in Paris’s 1st Arrondissement, became a legendary meeting place for celebrities such as Serge Gainsbourg, David Lynch, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Moss, and Kim Kardashian, due to its intimate, private atmosphere and the unique tradition of displaying Polaroid photographs of guests on the walls.

\nUpdated: \n        6:50 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s not uncommon for a bar or café to remind patrons that someone famous once ate there by having a physical photograph of said VIP on display. For 36 years however, at Davé, a Chinese restaurant on Rue Saint-Roch in Paris’s 1st Arrondissement, Polaroids of beloved guests were less a marketing tactic than a key feature of the building’s interior, framed and affixed to any available wall space.\n \n\n   \n  The various portraits, which included those of the singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, filmmaker David Lynch, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, model Kate Moss, and entrepreneur and socialite Kim Kardashian, made up something akin to a personal album for owner Tai “Davé” Cheung.\n \n\n   \n  “The immediacy fascinated me,” the restauranteur told CNN, recalling his initial interest in the Polaroid. He purchased the camera, at least partly inspired by Andy Warhol, the same year he opened Davé, in 1982, a year and half after his father’s restaurant shuttered. The photographer Helmut Newton and his wife June were early fans (so much so they spent a Christmas on the premises), quickly followed by Vogue’s Grace Coddington, until eventually Davé’s clientele was near-exclusively comprised of significant figures from the arenas of fashion, film, art, literature and music, as a new book, “ A Night at Davé ,” celebrates.\n \n\n   \n  Conceived with writers Charles Morin and Boris Bergmann and released by the London publisher IDEA, the book boasts 115 pages of photographs and selfies, as well as doodles and postcards from several guests. Sofia Coppola, whose father Francis Ford Coppola once booked the entire restaurant for New Year’s Eve, wrote the foreword. “I was fourteen and the place was filled with the fashion and show business of that era, people table-hopping and hanging out, platters of Davé’s mom’s Chinese food and Davé taking Polaroids,” she recalled, characterizing the mood that night. “Somehow I ended up cozied up with Yves Saint Laurent” — one of the 20th century’s foremost designers.\n \n\n   \n  “A party always felt like a kind of family gathering, something intimate,” Davé, as he is habitually referred, said over email. “Everything was closed, it created a very private, familial atmosphere.” Even outside the parameters of a private party, the discreet milieu of the restaurant — largely down to Davé’s considered seating arrangements and further encouraged by the scarce lighting (the glow of a tropical fish tank in the center of the space helped somewhat) — meant famous people, who would otherwise typically be bothered by strangers, felt comfortable and relaxed enough that most would return multiple times, making Davé the place to be.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in The New York Times in August 1998, Dana Thomas observed, “You can gauge who’s in and who’s out simply by what happens when he or she walks into Davé,” alluding to the owner’s guarded system. That it was close to Jardin des Tuileries, where much of Paris Fashion Week played out, further enamored it to editors, stylists, and models. Indeed, in January 2005, The Guardian ran a profile of the restaurant with the headline, “Welcome to the fashion canteen” (by this point Davé had moved to new premises, about ten minutes away on Rue de Richelieu, but still within the vicinity of fashion week footfall).\n \n\n   \n  With its distinctive swirling logo above the front door and, famously, always with a “complet” (meaning “full”) sign in the window, a practice that meant Davé was able to ensure space was kept available for his celebrity regulars, the Polaroid was a frequent feature of any night at the restaurant. “It was very instinctive (taking photographs). I wanted to preserve the beauty and joy of those moments, I didn’t know it would become a thing,” said Davé, who was taught how to focus the camera by the photographer and director, Jean-Baptiste Mondino. “At the beginning, the Polaroids just piled up. One day someone stole one — that’s when I understood they had value, that they were objects of desire.”\n \n\n   \n  The images that appear in the new book were safely stored away for years (most of those on the walls of the restaurant were copies, a preemptive measure to secure the memories had a future), but Davé estimates he produced a few thousand over the years. “I’ve lost some, given some away, but most are still with me. I particularly love the photos I took of people on the phone, like Aurore Clément, Keith Haring, and Mick Jagger. It’s rare to see them photographed like that,” he noted, recalling pictures of people using the landline. “They (the wider clientele) were very happy because they could see the result immediately. There’s no surprise with the Polaroid — you can’t take bad pictures of people without them knowing.”\n \n\n   \n  More than four decades after the restaurant opened, and seven years since it closed its doors for the last time, working on “A Night at Davé” has been a thoroughly positive experience for Davé. “I thought that Polaroids no longer had a place — that the phone has replaced them — but I loved diving back into my archives,” he said. “I didn’t feel sadness, nostalgia, or regret (putting the book together). I loved learning from people, diving into their worlds, their universes, so I was happy to see all the good moments I’d lived.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/justice-jackson-snap-fight","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Justice Jackson goes ‘her own way’ in Supreme Court’s SNAP fight","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a pivotal emergency case during the 2025 government shutdown, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the U.S. Supreme Court’s least senior justice, granted a temporary administrative stay to President Donald Trump’s request to halt a lower court order that would have funded SNAP benefits for over 40 million Americans.

That has been particularly notable   in   a series of cutting dissents she has written this year calling out the Trump administration for what she has framed as “ lawlessness .” And she has not spared her colleagues for acquiescing to the White House in some of those decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote in August when the court allowed the  Trump administration to halt about $800 million  in research grants. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”\n \n\n   \n  That pointed prose and her unflinching willingness to criticize her colleagues   has made Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by former President Joe Biden, a divisive figure.\n \n\n   \n  “Even before the SNAP case, Justice Jackson had already emerged as the most vocal, most frequent, and sharpest critic of the majority’s inconsistent, difficult-to-justify, and often unjustified behavior in Trump-related cases,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  Her machinations in the case, Vladeck said, underscored “a justice who is using every possible strategic and tactical maneuver behind the scenes to try to push the court toward what she believes the right answer is, but who is unafraid of sending increasingly loud public signals when those efforts are, as they so often have been this year, ultimately for naught.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal on funding for SNAP emerged as the highest-profile legal case of the government shutdown. A lower court  ordered the US Department of Agriculture  to transfer $4 billion from another fund to pay full SNAP benefits for November – an order that the administration appealed as an overreach of judicial power.\n \n\n   \n  With a midnight deadline approaching – and benefits for more than 40 million Americans hanging in the balance – the case landed in a rush at the Supreme Court on a Friday evening. Trump wanted the justices to temporarily block the lower court order, known as a “stay.”\n \n\n   \n  Because she handles emergency appeals from the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, the case went to Jackson. The “circuit justice” generally plays a straightforward role, setting a briefing schedule and – in big cases – ultimately referring the matter to the full court.   \n \n\n   \n  But as he has raced up to the Supreme Court this year in case after case, Trump has been asking for something else as well: An even shorter-term order known as an “administrative stay,” which freezes the lower court decision while the justices review the written arguments in the case.\n \n\n   \n  That administrative decision, usually, rests with the assigned justice – in this case, Jackson.\n \n\n   \n  A former trial court judge who recently took up boxing as a way to relieve stress, Jackson  ultimately granted Trump’s request , a move that initially raised anxiety among liberals and cheers from conservatives on social media. But Jackson also took several steps that were a departure from how other justices have handled administrative stays.\n \n\n   \n  First, Jackson included a few paragraphs of written explanation in her order, breaking from the   boilerplate-only language usually found in administrative stays. She wrote that she was granting Trump’s request “to facilitate” the appeals court’s “expeditious resolution” of the appeal.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court has faced enormous criticism this year for regularly overturning lower court orders on its emergency docket without explanation. While there are  sometimes good reasons  for brevity in those cases, some justices – such as Justice Elena Kagan – have said the court could  provide a little more explanation .\n \n\n   \n  Second, rather than leaving the timing open-ended, Jackson set her administrative order to lift 48 hours after the appeals court ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson likely understood – or at least assumed – there would be a majority to grant Trump’s request if she didn’t do so. By granting it herself but limiting the timeline, rather than sending it to the full court, she had the effect of bringing the case back to her chambers for a second look in an unusually short order, Vladeck wrote in  widely circulated post  over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Wydra said Jackson handled the case as should be done on the emergency docket. Justices, she said, should deal with the requests “quickly, as transparently as possible, and for logistical reasons, not…make what amount to significant substantive decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston who also wrote about Jackson’s maneuvers, agreed that she appeared to be going “her own way.”\n \n\n   \n  “She has a clear vision of how she wants the shadow docket to be run,” Blackman said.\n \n\n   \n  But, he suggested, it ultimately didn’t work. In the end, as Congress  drew closer to an agreement  to fund the government, the full court extended her administrative stay for a few days without writing to explain why. Jackson wound up in dissent, which she also registered without explanation. And the Trump administration ultimately got what it wanted.    \n \n\n   \n   Trump signed the spending measure  late Wednesday, reopening the federal government and funding the food program. Hours later, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the Supreme Court noting that it was abandoning its appeal – an anticlimactic end to a case that had significant real-world consequences.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, as the court announced it was reopening its doors to the public, a single line was added to the docket in the SNAP appeal: “Application withdrawn.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/alina-habba-office-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:55:00.000-05:00","title":"Man Ransacks New Jersey Federal Prosecutor’s Office After Being Denied Meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man, identified as Keith Michael Lisa, ransacked the New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office building after being denied a meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba.

He later kept the House out of session for an extraordinarily long time during the shutdown. This carried the benefit – whether it was the express purpose or not – of giving him an excuse not to swear in the decisive 218th member to force the vote.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump, too, clearly did not want this vote. He waged an unsuccessful  11th-hour campaign  on Wednesday to flip the handful of Republicans who signed the “discharge petition.”\n \n\n   \n  But the vote now looms, with Johnson announcing plans to schedule it for next week.  So, what happens next? What could the vote mean? And what are the political dynamics?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hardly the end of the road, but it’s clearly a significant moment that could set the Epstein saga off on a new trajectory.\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that, despite the pushback, this vote isn’t really the destination. It’s not like the House passes the bill, and suddenly the Justice Department releases the full Epstein case files. The bill would still need to be passed by the Senate and signed by the president.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s clearly a reason Johnson and the administration didn’t want the vote. The fear here seems to be that it 1) creates a very difficult decision for many Republican congressmembers, and it 2) could apply pressure on the Senate and the administration to follow suit – particularly if it passes by a large margin in the House.\n \n\n   \n  And the large margin appears to be what many are anticipating. CNN reported this week that House GOP leadership is expecting mass defections. The lead GOP co-sponsor of the discharge petition, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, isn’t exactly lowering expectations, either. He has  set a threshold for success at two-thirds  of the House, or nearly 290 votes, if all members are present.That’s the point at which enough members support the measure that it could overcome a presidential veto.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are somehow able to get two-thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president,” Massie told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That would indeed be a very symbolic victory. It would not only demonstrate that a wide, bipartisan majority of the House wants the files released, but it would suggest the chamber could actually override Trump’s attempt to block that – whether or not it would ever come to that.\n \n\n   \n  It would require about 75 out of the 219 House Republicans, if every Democrat voted in favor.\n \n\n   \n  Several Republicans have already said they will vote for the bill, despite not having supported Massie’s discharge petition. (Only four Republicans signed the petition.)\n \n\n   \n  And we’re also seeing how this all could start to register in the Senate, with Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana quickly signaling Thursday that the GOP should just go for full transparency. Kennedy had previously voted against an early effort by Senate Democrats to force the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t think this issue is going to go away until that issue is addressed and answered to the American people’s satisfaction,” Kennedy  told CNN’s Kasie Hunt . “And I may end up with  a sombrero on my head  for saying that, but that’s the way I see it.”\n \n\n   \n  These House members clearly face a difficult vote, with compelling dynamics pushing them in both directions.\n \n\n   \n  Among the dynamics pushing them to vote no are loyalty to Trump, which is the coin of the realm in today’s GOP. Trump has made it very clear that he will remember how these members vote.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” Trump  posted Wednesday on social media . He added that there “should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else.”\n \n\n   \n  Voting for the bill would be a significant rebuke of Trump and Johnson, who explicitly fought against this. It would suggest that the other measures taken – such as the House Oversight Committee’s release of some Epstein materials obtained from his estate – just weren’t good enough. Congressional Republicans  almost never buck Trump  like this.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leadership also has reason to try and limit defections, because of the level of pressure it could apply to the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  But on the other side are plenty of dynamics pressuring members to vote for the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The big one is how they would explain the vote to their constituents. The fact is that Americans overwhelmingly want all the files, they’re upset with the lack of transparency thus far, and they expect that the files contain significant information.\n \n\n   \n  Fully 77% of Americans wanted all the files released, as long as victims’ names are redacted, according to an  NPR-PBS-Marist College poll  in September. An earlier  CBS News-YouGov poll  showed 89% said the government should release all its information.\n \n\n   \n  Other  polling  has shown overwhelming majorities of Americans think damaging information about powerful people is contained in the files and that the government hasn’t been transparent enough.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, voting against releasing the records risks making you look like you’re part of a cover-up – a cover-up for pedophilia. And what if the stuff is actually going to come out anyway, and maybe even includes some significant information? Who wants to be one of the people who voted against that transparency?\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at another key dynamic here. At some point, Republicans who once upon a time led the charge to release the Epstein files – at least until the Trump administration reversed itself this summer – might just reason this is going to happen the easy way or the hard way.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Annie Grayer and Kristen Holmes  reported  Friday on a Trump ally on Capitol Hill who told the president directly that they questioned the strategy to keep delaying and downplaying things.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Trump, who hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, in many ways  seems to be seeding suspicion  about what the files might show about his own proximity to the convicted sex offender by fighting the transparency that his administration once promised. (Trump on Friday did push for  more investigation  into Epstein’s ties to high-profile figures — but that probe could be a further obstacle to a possible release of the DOJ’s files.)\n \n\n   \n  At some point, lawmakers might resent that the administration has so mishandled all of this, and view this vote as a chance to force the issue and hopefully get beyond all of it, after months of it looming over their heads.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the case, it’ll be one of the more fascinating votes in a long time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/asia/denis-obrezko-russia-hacker-thailand-void-blizzard","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:49:00-05:00","title":"Russian alleged cyber-hacker faces extradition to US after arrest in Thailand","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Russian man, Denis Obrezko, has been arrested in Phuket, Thailand, in a joint operation with Thai authorities and the FBI, following allegations that he is part of the cyber-espionage group Void Blizzard.

\nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Americans could soon see some goods get cheaper after President Donald Trump exempted certain agricultural imports from a set of tariffs on Friday. But any price drops likely won’t be enough to make life feel more affordable any time soon.\n \n\n   \n  The executive order  exempted products like coffee, beef and some fruit  from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which began rolling out in April.\n \n\n   \n  The new exemptions are part of what traders have dubbed TACO, or Trump Always Chickens Out, to describe times when the president backs off a policy after unintended consequences pop up. In the case of tariffs, Trump has already reversed a number of his measures, a sign that the administration  is reshaping his signature economic tool .\n \n\n   \n  The latest TACO comes after voters, worried about affordability,  gave Republicans a drubbing  in recent off-year elections.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the new exemptions generally won’t help improve affordability.\n \n\n   \n  “It depends on what the importers do with the tariff,” he said in a CNBC interview on Friday. “So when you look at the overall price trend, it hasn’t been because of tariffs. It’s been because of these other events going on and just supply and demand.”\n \n\n   \n  But in cases where tariffs have been passed along to consumers, prices could drop, Greer said.\n \n\n   \n  One potential example: bananas. American consumers are paying about 8% more for bananas than before Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  The US largely imports bananas from South American countries. With bananas exempt from “reciprocal” tariffs that started at 10%, prices could go back to where they were earlier this year, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. But it’s unlikely to be something most consumers notice unless they’re buying bananas often, she added.\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone is convinced it will even do that much.\n \n\n   \n  “It is not clear that lowering tariffs will lower prices — it depends on what retailers think they can get away with. The import price of bananas has fallen since tariffs were imposed, but the US consumer price has risen,” Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS global wealth management, said in a note last week. (The United States tracks import prices before accounting for tariffs. In some cases, import prices have fallen as exporters lower what they charge as a way to share in the tariff expense importers pay.)\n \n\n   \n    Make America more affordable?\n \n\n   \n  The White House has ramped up its efforts to convince voters that affordability issues are just a hangover from former President Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  “Putting Joe Biden’s inflation crisis firmly behind us has been a priority for President Trump since Day One, when he signed an array of executive orders to slash costly regulations and unleash American energy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  But economists generally agree that Trump’s tariffs aren’t making matters better.\n \n\n   \n  And while prices normally fluctuate, especially for food, they generally get more expensive over time, House said. “That’s why this isn’t going to, I think, cure consumers’ angst about elevated prices,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-colleges-california-funding-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00.000-05:00","title":"Judge Bars Trump from Immediately Cutting Funding to the University of California","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in San Francisco, US District Judge Rita Lin, has blocked the Trump administration from immediately cutting federal funding or imposing fines on the University of California, citing a 'concerted campaign' to target universities with 'left-wing' or 'woke' policies.

endorsement of Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene  and attacked her in personal terms, while the congresswoman countered that Trump was trying to make an example of her to prevent the release of files on  convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .\n \n\n   \n  The president’s post marked a major political breakup  weeks in the making  – a dramatic intensification of a simmering  back-and-forth between the two former allies , who grew apart as Greene criticized Trump on a number of fronts. It spilled into a messy exchange of blows as the controversy around Epstein again took center stage in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene,” Trump said in a  post  to social media, adding that Greene, who is running for reelection in 2026, has “gone Far Left.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene has publicly warned in recent weeks that Trump has been too focused on foreign policy and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home – taking her message to outlets like CNN and  ABC’s “The View.”  Greene, who arrived in Congress in 2021, has until recently been an ardent and outspoken Trump supporter.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican responded to Trump in a  social media post  Friday, writing, “Of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Friday, Trump defended his efforts to engage with foreign leaders and travel abroad amid Greene’s criticism, suggesting that his relationships on the world stage have benefited her district and expressing openness to endorsing a potential primary challenger.\n \n\n   \n  “Marjorie Taylor Greene said, ‘Oh, gee, I’m spending too much time overseas. So let’s say I don’t meet with China. You know what’s happened right now to Georgia? To every other state?” Trump said aboard Air Force One.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “They’re not working because your magnets and your rare earths would’ve kicked in, and there wouldn’t have been a factory in the world working if I didn’t have a relationship overseas with China.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that he is in the United States “95, 98% of the time.”\n \n\n   \n  “The last thing I want to do is travel 22 hours in an airplane, as nice as this plane is,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump warned that Greene has “changed” politically in recent weeks as the Georgia congresswoman has publicly lambasted the White House’s messaging on the government shutdown and Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that her constituents aren’t going to be happy. Already, I have people calling me. They want to challenge her to a race in her district in Georgia,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  He also said he was open to endorsing a rival GOP candidate in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  Greene is one of four House Republicans who has signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on release of Justice Department documents pertaining to the Epstein case, but CNN has reported that the number of House Republicans that could break from Trump and vote for the files’ release could be greater. Trump has repeatedly and emphatically described calls for transparency around his ties to Epstein as a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  But Greene’s message has also extended more broadly to target Trump’s economic policies, suggesting that the White House needs to improve its messaging on affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  Greene fired back in her social media post on Friday with a pair of screenshots of text messages that appeared to be sent to Trump and his aide, Natalie Harp.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans, she wrote, “wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to a contact in her phone labeled “DJT,” Greene encouraged Trump to “lean into” Epstein’s ties to other high-profile figures and what she described as the “deep state.” In a separate message to Harp, she voiced her support for Trump but said the White House must “stop ignoring the women. … Them being raped as teenagers is not a hoax.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/us/trump-administration-compensation-flight-disruptions-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"13:51:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration drops plan to require passenger compensation for delayed flights","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has formally withdrawn a proposed rule from the Biden administration that would have required U.S. airlines to pay passengers cash compensation for significant flight delays—ranging from $200 to $775 depending on duration.

 Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s administration said on Friday it was formally withdrawing a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when US flight disruptions are caused by carriers.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, the US Transportation Department under then-President Joe Biden sought public comment on writing rules  to require airlines to pay  $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays.\n \n\n   \n  In September, USDOT first disclosed  it planned to withdraw the proposal . On Friday, USDOT said the rules would result in “unnecessary regulatory burdens” in explaining why it would not go forward.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, a group of 18 Democratic senators urged the Trump administration not to drop the compensation plan.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a common-sense proposal: when an airline’s mistake imposes unanticipated costs on families, the airline should try to remedy the situation by providing accommodations to consumers and helping cover their costs,” said the letter signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey and others.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines in the US must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules. No large US airline currently guarantees cash compensation for significant flight disruption.\n \n\n   \n  USDOT said Friday in abandoning the compensation plan that it would “allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.”\n \n\n   \n  USDOT also announced in September it was considering rescinding Biden regulations requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose service fees alongside airfares.\n \n\n   \n  It also plans to reduce regulatory burdens on airlines and ticket agents by writing new rules detailing the definition of a flight cancellation that entitles consumers to ticket refunds, as well as revisiting rules on ticket pricing and advertising.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines have pushed the Trump administration to go further and praised the action to rescind the Biden plan.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/ukraine-russia-assassination-attempt-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00-20:51","title":"Ukraine attacks key Russian oil hub as deadly strikes pound Kyiv","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine launched a major strike on Novorossiysk, a key Russian oil export terminal, using Neptune cruise missiles and unmanned drones, causing significant infrastructure damage and a major fire.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukraine struck a key oil terminal in the Russian port city of Novorossiysk overnight, causing infrastructure damage and igniting a blaze, as deadly overnight Russian strikes pounded Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  The depot, one of Russia’s largest oil export facilities, was targeted by Ukrainian forces in an attack acknowledged by officials from both countries that highlights Kyiv’s escalating efforts to target a key source of war revenue for Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian General Staff said damage was caused to “valuable” infrastructure at the port and oil terminal, as well as a launcher from Russia’s S400 air defense system.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian weapons were used in the attack on Novorossiysk, including long-range Neptune missiles and various types of strike UAVs, the

A state of emergency has been declared there, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Russia’s defense ministry said it had intercepted a total of 216 Ukrainian drones overnight.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, residents of Kyiv experienced another heavy night of Russian aerial attacks. The Russian strikes on Ukraine’s capital killed at least seven people and injured dozens more, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  A married couple, aged 71 and 73, were among those killed, Kyiv police said.\n \n\n   \n  Two more people were killed in a Russian attack on the Black Sea city of Chornomorsk on Friday morning, according to the head of the Odesa regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n    Foiled assassination plot\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Russia’s security service has claimed it foiled a plot by Ukraine to assassinate a high-ranking Kremlin official inside Russia as the alleged target visited a graveyard.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian special services were planning to target the unnamed man, described as “one of the highest-ranking officials of the Russian state,” while he was visiting the graves of his relatives at a cemetery outside Moscow, according to a Friday statement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n \n\n   \n  The FSB also claimed in its statement that Ukraine is planning similar attacks inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  CNN could not independently verify Russia’s claims.

tore through Russia’s pipelines to Europe are still causing rifts years on \n       \n  By Joseph Ataman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:31 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It was a late September night when muffled blasts and a stream of bubbles broke the surface of the Baltic Sea.  Explosions  had ripped through the two Nord Stream gas pipelines, Russia’s gas highway into Europe, months after Moscow’s full invasion of Ukraine. Years later, shockwaves from that night are still rippling across the continent.\n \n\n   \n  The 2022 attack on the hugely controversial pipelines triggered an international whodunnit, with suspicion falling immediately on Russia and even the US being forced to deny involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Today, intrigue continues to swirl around the blasts even as Germany readies a prosecution against the  suspected Ukrainian saboteurs . And Poland’s efforts to stymie the case – seemingly to shield its ally Ukraine - has thrown up new tensions in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Germany seems determined for Nord Stream to gets its day in court, filing arrest warrants for two Ukrainian men – Volodymyr Zhuravlov, who was detained in Poland, and Serhii Kuznietsov, who was detained in Italy - suspected of involvement in the blast.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of other nations have cast doubt on whether criminal proceedings should be brought against those allegedly responsible.\n \n\n   \n  A decision by a Polish court in mid-October to free Zhuravlov, after slow-balling the man’s extradition, has severely undercut Berlin’s hopes of a prosecution. In the eyes of the judge, if the Nord Stream blasts were a Ukrainian act of sabotage, that would be a justified response to an unprovoked invasion.\n \n\n   \n  “If Ukraine was indeed the organizer of this act of aggression, then only Ukraine can be held responsible for this event,” Judge Dariusz Lubowski said in his verdict halting Zhuravlov’s extradition to Germany, CNN affiliate TVN24  reported .\n \n\n   \n  The 49-year-old Ukrainian claims he had nothing to do with the attack and that he was in Ukraine at the time it happened, according to TVN24.\n \n\n   \n  German prosecutors allege Zhuravlov, a “trained diver,” was “part of a group of individuals who placed explosives on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines near the island of Bornholm in September 2022.” The team allegedly used fake identities to rent a yacht to ferry them and their equipment to the blast site.\n \n\n   \n  Serhii Kuznietsov, a 49-year-old former Ukrainian soldier and an alleged coordinator of the operation, was detained on a German warrant in Italy in late August.\n \n\n   \n  Kuznietsov’s defense lawyer Nicola Canestrini told CNN that the Ukrainian denies any wrongdoing and he is currently appealing Italy’s Supreme Court’s decision to extradite him to Germany.\n \n\n   \n  “Europe’s problem, Ukraine’s problem, the problem of Lithuania and Poland, is not that Nord Stream 2 was blown up, but that it was built,”   Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told journalists in early October.\n \n\n   \n  “It is certainly not in the interest of Poland, nor in the interest of decency and justice, to prosecute or extradite this citizen to another state,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Tusk’s stance reflects long-standing concerns over the pipelines within Europe and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  As far back as 2007, Poland’s then-defense minister Radek Sikorski  railed  against the proposed Nord Stream 1 pipeline as, “the most outrageous attempt by Mr Putin to divide and damage the EU.”\n \n\n   \n  Europe’s dependency on Russian hydrocarbons has faced opposition from US administrations going back to the White House of George W. Bush. That feeling has long been bipartisan: as Republican Senator Ted Cruz told senators in 2019: the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, “if completed, would make Europe even more dependent on Russian energy, even more vulnerable to Russian blackmail.”\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, the Polish stance exposed divisions in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  “Shocking” was how Peter Szijjarto, foreign minister of Hungary – one of Russia’s few allies on the continent and the recent recipient of a  US exemption  allowing them to continue buying Russian oil and gas - described Tusk’s stance.\n \n\n   \n  “One thing is clear: we don’t want a Europe where prime ministers defend terrorists,” he  wrote on X. \n \n\n   \n  For many in Europe’s north, the attention on who blew up Nord Stream is a distraction from remembering how it was built in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Lithuania’s former foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told CNN that, if you take the legal case in isolation, “it might force us to forget how we got there.” The Polish government’s position “has quite a lot to do with their internal politics, their president being from a very nationalist party,”\n \n\n   \n  Helga Kalm, deputy director of Estonia’s International Center for Defence and Security, told CNN. “It’s their sign of showing Germany that they’re doing the wrong thing” in pursuing a prosecution that could harm Ukrainian interests.\n \n\n   \n  Many in Europe’s post-Soviet countries, Poland chief among them, finally feel vindicated after decades of warning against the push from European powers like Germany to warm ties with Russia.\n \n\n   \n    Hunt for ‘justice’\n \n\n   \n  Both  Denmark  and Sweden – whose waters sit astride the Nord Stream pipeline – declined to pursue cases into the blasts, with Sweden citing a lack of jurisdiction.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Germany has forged ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a rule of law state,” Stefan Meister, an expert on Eastern Europe from the German Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is particularly for domestic purposes,” he added. With right-wing populists the AfD challenging the credibility of state institutions, allowing German justice to follow its course is about, “the credibility of the system and the institution and the ruling political elites,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Germany was the driving force in Europe behind the Nord Stream pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  And it reaped the benefits. In 2016, nearly 30% of German gas needs were met by Russian suppliers, funnelling gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, according to  German government figures .\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s chancellor between 1998 and 2005, Gerhard Schroeder, went on to try to join the board of Russian energy giant Gazprom and became chairman of Russia’s oil giant Rosneft after leaving office.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, the pipelines became totemic of the dependence on cheap Russian hydrocarbons that critics felt Europe traded for a principled stance on Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  Former Chancellor Angela Merkel attracted special criticism for her conciliatory approach to Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  In Merkel’s recently released memoir, she rebutted accusations that Germany had been dependent on Russian gas, writing, “particularly in the case of Nord Stream 2, even though no gas had ever been transported through this pipeline… It was a relic of a failed investment.”\n \n\n   \n  Given how interwoven many in German politics were with the push to construct the Nord Stream pipelines, today many politicians would welcome distancing themselves from the case, Meister said.\n \n\n   \n  “My impression is they want to wash themselves clean,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Need for clarity\n \n\n   \n  The fog around the case only serves to feed tensions in Europe at a time when unity against Russia, and an unpredictable ally in the US, is all-important. Russia’s efforts to sow divisions abroad are well documented but here the Kremlin may have achieved one of its goals without lifting a finger.\n \n\n   \n  Nord Stream risks “further questions and maybe fractures within the alliance,” Landsbergis said. “Especially at a time where we’re no longer at peace, that should be remembered.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the result of Germany’s quest for judicial satisfaction over Nord Stream, Russian gas won’t be flowing south like it did before 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe has battled to wean itself off a decades-long dependence on Russia gas. The loss of Nord Stream only hastened that.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s share of EU imports of pipeline gas dropped from more than 40% in 2021 to about 11% in 2024, according to  EU figures .\n \n\n   \n  “The right place for Nord Stream 2 is at the bottom of the sea, in pieces,” Estonia’s Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in March.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/business/mega-millions-980m-jackpot-winning-ticket-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:31:00.000-05:00","title":"Single ticket in Georgia claims $980 million Mega Millions jackpot","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Georgia player has won an estimated $980 million in the Mega Millions jackpot, the eighth-largest in the game’s history, after a 40-drawing streak without a winner.

carried out 20th strike on alleged drug boats, killing 4, official says \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon conducted  its 20th strike   on an alleged drug trafficking boat earlier   this week, a Defense Department official said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “The strike occurred in the Caribbean and four narco-terrorists were killed, no survivors,” the official confirmed in a statement to CNN. Trump administration officials  have acknowledged  they do not necessarily know the identities of the individuals aboard the vessels before they are targeted.\n \n\n   \n  The strike occurred on Monday, the official said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously announced two Sunday strikes, the 18th and 19th conducted by the US military, on two vessels each with three people aboard. Hegseth said in a post on X the following day that those strikes killed all six. The 20th strike was first reported   by CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  US Southern Command on Friday released video of the 20th strike, writing in a post on X, “On Nov. 10, at the direction of Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization.”\n \n\n   \n  The attack   brings the total number of people killed by the US military’s strikes on the alleged drug boats to 80. CNN  has reported  that the military is using a variety of fighter jets, drones, and gunships to carry out the strikes in the campaign officials say is meant to disrupt the flow of drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has  told Congress  the administration does not need its approval to carry out the strikes, which some experts have said could violate US and international law. The ongoing campaign has also begun to surface tensions with allies; the United Kingdom has stopped sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels to avoid being complicit in the strikes,  CNN reported this week , which the UK believes are illegal. The president of Colombia also said this week that he had ordered his country to suspend intelligence sharing with the US until the attacks stop.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-epstein-doj-investigate-enemies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump Says He’s Asking Justice Department to Investigate Epstein’s Ties to Sleek of High-Profile Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a federal criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s relationships with high-profile figures such as Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, and J.P.

Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later on Friday confirmed she would launch the investigation on Trump’s orders, assigning Jay Clayton, the top prosecutor in New York’s southern district, to lead the federal probe.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you, Mr. President,” she wrote in a  post on X  that included a screenshot of Trump’s request.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, after Bondi ordered the FBI to review Epstein files for release, Justice and FBI officials conducted another assessment and determined there were no additional prosecutions that could be brought based on the evidence at hand, according to law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s move on Friday   represents the president’s most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of the president’s belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Why doesn’t he just release these? Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. “Now he’s in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  lengthy thread on X , Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, blasted Trump’s directive and called on the administration to release all the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein,” he wrote, adding later, “I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Clinton  said on X : “These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Summers for comment about Trump’s demands for an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank “ended our relationship with (Epstein) years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump earlier this week  tried and failed  to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department’s Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.\n \n\n   \n  Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert some documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee that had not yet been released. Trump appeared to acknowledge Friday that was part of a bid by his administration to dissuade her from driving more conversation on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “When you talk about the Epstein hoax, what happens is, you’re not talking about how well we’ve done,” Trump added while speaking aboard Air Force One. “That’s the whole purpose behind them. They want to waste people’s time and some of the dumber Republicans like that, but it’s mostly Democrats, by the way.”\n \n\n   \n  But they could not change her mind.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realization that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  But the newly announced criminal investigation could give the Justice Department a new justification to resist turning over files — or convince some lawmakers to back off. Generally, the department resists giving Congress files during an ongoing criminal investigation because any public release could jeopardize the integrity of the probe or any resulting criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “This will certainly give members of Congress a basis on which to vote against disclosing the Epstein files,” CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. “If there’s an ongoing criminal investigation, that’s a perfectly good reason for Congress to back off or to vote no.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the controversy Friday night, Trump told reporters he and Epstein had “a very bad relationship for years,” and sought to turn the focus to those he had demanded face investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Summers, whatever his name is, and all of the other people that he spent time with, Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years. But he also saw strength, because I was president, so he dictated a couple of memos to himself. Give me a break. You’re gonna find out what did he know, with respect to Bill Clinton, with respect to the head of Harvard, with respect to all of those people that he knew, including JP Morgan Chase,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails released earlier this week, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails “prove literally nothing” and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein “hoax” to distract from the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration’s response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump doesn’t want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn’t prove anything,” one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In the 24 hours after the House Oversight Committee’s Wednesday release of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name, Trump had declined to take questions from the press. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.” He then took questions from reporters while flying to Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote in one post.\n \n\n   \n  He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into “many other people and institutions” in a subsequent Truth Social post.\n \n\n   \n  In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  Clinton and Epstein had been friendly in the early 2000s, with the former president appearing on Epstein’s private jet logs at least 16 times between 2002 and 2003 for trips he said were related to Clinton Foundation work. Clinton would  later write  that his relationship with Epstein had ended by 2003 before he was aware of the financier’s crimes. Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein’s survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell, Kit Maher, Evan Perez and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/americas/venezuela-maduro-noriega-panama-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:01:00-05:00","title":"As Washington weighs options on Venezuela, US invasion of Panama offers an imperfect blueprint for military action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses how the 1989 US invasion of Panama, which targeted dictator Manuel Noriega for drug trafficking and authoritarianism, is being invoked as an imperfect model for potential military action against Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro.

action \n       \n  By Patrick Oppmann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:01 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Latin American strongman accused of drug trafficking and rigging elections openly defies the White House despite threats of military action.\n \n\n   \n  It was 1989 and the then military dictator of Panama Manuel Noriega, much like Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro today, had become public enemy number one in Washington, amid allegations that he took millions of dollars to allow drug cartels to operate in his country.\n \n\n   \n  The US invasion of Panama led to Noriega’s capture and restored democracy to the Central American nation.\n \n\n   \n  To some pushing for military action against Maduro, the Panama invasion seems like a model – however imperfect – for what the US is trying to accomplish in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Bush 41 took Panamanian leader Noriega down under similar circumstances,” Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) posted on X Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a drug caliphate in our backyard that includes Venezuela, Colombia and Cuba. I am very glad President Trump is dedicated to ending this reign of terror,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Officials from all three countries have denied any ties to trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Maduro, a committed socialist and longtime thorn in the side of US foreign policy aims in the region, Noriega, at least initially, presented himself as a US ally.\n \n\n   \n  Through much of his bloody rise to power in Panama – the small but geopolitically key country with its canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans – Noriega was a CIA asset, assisting to stamp out the spread of leftist governments in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  But as CIA arms flowed through Panama to support anti-communist rebels in Central America, Noriega had a secret: He was also allowing tons of cocaine to pass north to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega’s fungible loyalties led former US Ambassador to Panama Ambler Moss to declare of the Panamanian dictator, “You can’t buy him, but you can sure as hell rent him.”\n \n\n   \n  By 1989 Noriega’s double dealing and brutal crackdown on civil society led to Washington issuing an ultimatum: Go into exile or else.\n \n\n   \n  Like Maduro today – who vehemently denies US allegations of drug trafficking – Noriega had to choose whether to flee or face off with a military far superior to his own.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, retired Panamanian General Rubén Darío Paredes told CNN, Noriega opted for exile.\n \n\n   \n  “He began making arrangements for the succession of command according to the hierarchy, but he had a moment of weakness,” Paredes said. “When many of that group who had been exposed began to think about their fate, right? They were exposed, and they made common cause and convinced Noriega that he was the ultimate authority, that there was no turning back. Then Noriega backed down and that’s when the invasion happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing Noriega’s defiance and worsening repression, US President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama – codenamed “Operation Just Cause” – in December 1989, arguing Noriega’s rule posed a threat to US lives and security.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 20,000 US troops on Panamanian soil, Noriega took refuge in the Vatican’s embassy in Panama City for 10 days. US troops surrounded the compound with loudspeakers blasting his hideout with deafening heavy metal music through the night.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega eventually surrendered to US Drug Enforcement Administration officials on January 3, 1990.\n \n\n   \n  His trial in 1991 was called the “trial of the century” by the DEA and eventually saw him found guilty on eight counts and sentenced to 40 years in jail.\n \n\n   \n  While taking down a repressive leader with ties to drug cartels – Maduro also faces a US indictment for trafficking – seems identical to US’ goals in Venezuela, there are important differences.\n \n\n   \n  Panama in 1989, when the US invasion took place, only had a population of 2.5 million, Venezuela’s population today is over 28 million.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s land mass is more than ten times the size of Panama – which, at the time of the invasion, hosted US military bases.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, as with Noriega when he considered exile, many in Maduro’s inner circle face US trafficking allegations or million-dollar rewards for their capture, making them unlikely to see him leave power without a fight.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, any US military action in Venezuela would likely have to contend with the country’s impenetrable jungles and dense slums, where gang members are so heavily armed that even the Venezuelan military rarely enters.\n \n\n   \n  Frank Mora, former US Ambassador at the organization of American states OAS who has studied how a possible US invasion could unfold and the hurdles the US military faces in deposing Maduro, said the US could topple the Venezuelan leader easily but keeping the peace is another matter.\n \n\n   \n  “The question of Venezuelan military capability is not a serious one,” Mora said. “It’s not one that could sustain a US invasion, but my concern has always been, it’s not just the time that it requires to bring down the regime, it’s the day after, and how do you maintain order in a country that has essentially collapsed?”\n \n\n   \n  While it remains unclear if the US will put any boots on the ground or even carry out strikes in Venezuela, increasingly it appears the US will not count on the support of many regional allies.\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference on Thursday, Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, who publicly opposed the Noriega dictatorship before the US invasion, said his country would not host any US forces that might take part in a military action against Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “In relation to Venezuela we don’t have anything to do with that,” Mulino said. “Panama is not lending its territory for any hostile act against Venezuela or another country in the world.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/entertainment/sag-awards-changes-name","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00Z","title":"The SAG Awards Has a New, Less Confusing Name","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Screen Actors Guild Awards is being rebranded as The Actor Awards, a name change that aligns the show with the actual award statuette and improves clarity for global audiences.

The staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports, frozen at 6% since Wednesday night when the shutdown ended, will drop to 3% starting on Saturday, the Department of Transportation said.\n \n\n   \n  “The 3 percent reduction will remain in place while the FAA monitors system performance throughout the weekend and evaluates whether normal operations can resume,” the DOT said in a news release on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would “allow U.S. airlines to restore their operations ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday.”\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian feels optimistic about a swift recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings” on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone.

flu virus never before reported in people is behind first human case in US in nine months \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Washington resident has been hospitalized with bird flu, according to the Washington State Health Department, and they’re infected with a strain of the virus that hasn’t been seen in humans before.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months, but the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  says that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.\n \n\n   \n  The patient, who has been hospitalized with H5N5 avian influenza since early this month, is described as an older resident of Grays Harbor County who has underlying health issues. It isn’t clear exactly how they caught the virus; state and local public health and agriculture officials are investigating, but they suspect that the person may have been exposed through backyard poultry.\n \n\n   \n  The virus spreads through an animal’s saliva, mucus and feces, or through milk from dairy cattle. The general risk of bird flu goes up in the late fall and winter as birds migrate and come into contact with other animals like backyard flocks.\n \n\n   \n  Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.\n \n\n   \n  There has been no known human-to-human transmission of the virus in the US, but public health leaders in Washington are contacting people who may have been in close contact with the Grays Harbor patient to check for symptoms and offer testing and treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the overall risk to the public is low, Dr. Richard Webby says, the virus still has “pandemic potential.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s clear it’s not an easy leap for this virus to make, to switch from being a duck virus to being a human virus. I think that’s pretty clear, but I certainly wouldn’t put money on the fact that it can’t make that leap,” said Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. “It’s going to take a little bit of the biologic stars aligning for that to happen. We could argue exactly how likely that is, but no one actually knows. Only time will tell us, unfortunately.”\n \n\n   \n  Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the ongoing outbreak, according to the CDC. One person died in January who was also elderly and had underlying conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.\n \n\n   \n  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington State Department of Health urges people cleaning up around bird feeders and other areas exposed to bird feces to wear gloves and disinfect the area with a mixture of one part bleach to 10 parts water or a commercial disinfectant like Lysol spray.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife. If disposing of a dead bird, wear a well-fitting face mask and disposable gloves, and use an inside-out plastic bag to pick up the carcass. The health department suggests double-bagging the bird and disposing of it in a sealed trash can so other animals don’t try to eat it. Wash hand thoroughly afterwards.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid consuming uncooked, undercooked or unpasteurized food like raw cheese or raw milk.\n \n\n   \n  The health department also recommends getting a flu shot. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/chicago-immigration-arrests-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:32:00-05:00","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Chicago’s Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major legal victory for immigrant rights advocates, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ruled that hundreds of individuals arrested during Operation Midway Blitz — a federal immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas from June to October 2025 — must be released.

arrested in Chicago’s immigration crackdown. What happens next? \n       \n  By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:32 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the latest judicial blow to President Donald Trump’s push to detain and  deport undocumented immigrants  en masse, a judge ruled Wednesday hundreds of people arrested in an Illinois immigration operation must be released.\n \n\n   \n  The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know – and what we don’t know – about what happens next.\n \n\n   \n    What did the judge decide?\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was  nominated by  former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022 settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Cummings ruled  agents violated the  previously agreed upon consent decree .\n \n\n   \n  Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026,  and says  if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”\n \n\n   \n    Who will be released and when?\n \n\n   \n  Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Out of a list of the more than 600 detainees the Justice Department shared with the court, only 16 had explanations for why they were given an “ICE Further Designation of High Public Safety Risk.” The document indicates they were arrested for a range of charges, including for aggravated assault, DUI, domestic battery, and criminal conspiracy to traffic narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  The document also lists around 40 people as having a “high” risk to public safety designation – though officials do not provide the reasons why. CNN has reached out to Department of Homeland Security and DOJ attorneys for clarity.\n \n\n   \n  Two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”\n \n\n   \n  The list of detainees CNN reviewed showed that 75 people have already been “removed” and multiple others are listed as having been “paroled” or “bonded out.”\n \n\n   \n    What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.\n \n\n   \n  But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.\n \n\n   \n  “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n   “We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his CBP agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including  from a federal judge , for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin  previously told CNN , while  other immigration legal challenges  move through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago  amid protests against  the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Zoe Sottile, Dianne Gallagher and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/appeals-court-declines-probable-cause-order-trump-officials-contempt","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:19:00-05:00","title":"Appeals court declines to reinstate order finding ‘probable cause exists’ to hold Trump officials in criminal contempt","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A divided federal appeals court declined to reinstate a prior ruling that found probable cause for criminal contempt against Trump administration officials for violating a court order to halt deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.

order finding ‘probable cause exists’ to hold Trump officials in criminal contempt \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:19 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A divided federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration on Friday in a case over the president’s use of the  Alien Enemies Act  in deportation matters — but it did not fully snuff out a lower court judge’s efforts to punish those who ignored previous orders halting the president’s use of the law.\n \n\n   \n  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday declined to reinstate an order from US District Judge James Boasberg that found “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for violating his prior orders to temporarily stop using the law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n \n\n   \n  The Friday appeals court ruling is the latest blow to Boasberg’s efforts to hold accountable the administration officials who didn’t follow his orders earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three months ago, a three-judge panel of the appeals court wiped away Boasberg’s contempt ruling from April. Now, the entire appeals court has decided to keep that ruling intact.\n \n\n   \n  But the court’s decision does not fully tie Boasberg’s hands. Because of the way the appeals court ruled this summer – and the court’s decision on Friday to not disturb that ruling – Boasberg is able to move forward with his fact-finding inquiry around the officials involved in the matter, and several members of the court went out of their way to make that point clear Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court remains free to require the government to identify the decision makers who directed the potentially contemptuous actions and to carefully consider next steps,” three appeals court judges wrote in a statement respecting the court’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the migrants at the center of the case, said the court’s latest ruling “allows us to go back before Judge Boasberg and present all of the new evidence from the whistleblower that the government deliberately violated the court’s order not to hand over the Venezuelan men to El Salvador.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, an ex-Justice Department lawyer alleged in a whistleblower complaint that a then-top DOJ official told his colleagues in March that the administration intended to ignore court orders as part of the government’s aggressive deportation effort.\n \n\n   \n  In court proceedings this summer, Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, raised the whistleblower’s claims, saying he would be interested in scrutinizing them should any contempt proceedings before him start back up.\n \n\n   \n  Three judges at the DC Circuit – all of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents – dissented from the court’s decision on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In a stinging dissent penned by appeals court Judge Florence Pan, the appointee of former President Joe Biden skewered the Trump administration’s “meritless appeal” of Boasberg’s ruling from April and her colleagues’ earlier decision to scramble the judge’s plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Our constitutional system was functioning as designed until a panel of this court improvidently intervened,” Pan wrote. “The district court was called upon to check an allegedly unlawful policy implemented by the Executive Branch. When the government apparently defied a court order, the district court properly investigated. In merely seeking information about the government’s apparent contempt of court, the district court did not violate any nondiscretionary duty nor clearly abuse its discretion.”\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg, she said, “did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Pan also pointed to comments from President Donald Trump earlier this year that were critical of Boasberg as the case was unfolding. Trump called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “We should not leave in place a ruling that says that the district court erred when it did not,” she wrote. “We live in a world in which judges face threats and harassment because of their rulings and have been called ‘rogue’ by government officials who disagree with them. And we cannot overlook that, in response to this very case, the President of the United States called for the district judge’s impeachment.”\n \n\n   \n  She continued: “The district court performed its constitutional duty with unwavering integrity and courage, in the face of undue public criticism from the most powerful official in our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  In the case before Boasberg, the judge had ordered the administration in mid-March to turn around planes carrying migrants being deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.\n \n\n   \n  The flights continued, and the migrants were held at the prison for several months before being released this summer as part of a prisoner swap with Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court ultimately determines that the Government’s actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt,”  Boasberg wrote in a 46-page ruling detailing his decision  in April.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/john-beam-laney-college-shooting-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00Z","title":"John Beam, beloved former football coach featured in Netflix’s 'Last Chance U', dies after shooting on California campus","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Beam, a revered former football coach at Laney College in Oakland, died from gunshot wounds sustained during a targeted shooting on campus on November 14, 2025.

football coach featured in Netflix’s ‘Last Chance U’, dies after shooting on California campus \n       \n  By Laura Sharman, Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  John Beam, a cherished football coach whose mentorship and care touched the lives of thousands of people, has died after being shot Thursday on an Oakland college campus — a devastating loss for a California community still reeling from another act of school gun violence just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  The revered Bay Area football figure featured in Netflix documentary series “Last Chance U” was rushed to Highland Hospital in critical condition Thursday but died Friday morning, Oakland police homicide commander Lt. Gloria Beltran announced at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Police identified the suspect as 27-year-old Cedric Irving, Beltran said. The suspect was acquainted with Beam but did not have a close relationship with him, according to Oakland Assistant Chief of Police James Beere.\n \n\n   \n  For many, the news felt unthinkable.\n \n\n   \n  Piedmont Police Chief Frederick Shavies described Beam as a “father figure to thousands of not only men but young women,” someone who left an “indelible” imprint on Oakland and far beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds gathered for a vigil Thursday night, holding candles and hope as Beam fought for his life — the same way he had spent decades teaching young people to fight for their own, Shavies said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hearts are aching,” Shavies said, reflecting on the man he had known since eighth grade — the man who stepped in with support after Shavies’ father died.\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s family said in a statement read by police: “We are devastated that John — our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, coach, mentor and friend — has passed. Our hearts are full from the outpouring of love and support from all who cared about him. We are deeply grateful for your continued prayers and ask for privacy during this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, questions remain about what authorities described as a “very targeted incident,” as the suspect awaits formal charges. The case will be referred to the district attorney’s office for review.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about the suspect\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday at 11:53 a.m., Oakland Police officers responded to Laney College and found Beam suffering from gunshot wounds, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  Beam had been at the college’s fieldhouse, which houses the athletic training facilities, where he continued serving as athletic director after retiring as head football coach last year. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and listed in critical condition.\n \n\n   \n  Officials obtained photos of the suspect, who was later spotted at the San Leandro Bay Area Rapid Transit station. He was taken into custody and gave a statement to police regarding the shooting, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  “The ability to actually track the suspect after he left Laney College was a diligent effort and an amazing, heavy lift to go through hundreds of hours of surveillance footage so we could track that individual,” Beere, Oakland’s assistant chief of police, said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect played football at Skyline High School in Oakland, but not while Beam was employed there, authorities said. Although Irving was not a student at Laney College, he was often seen loitering on campus, Beere added.\n \n\n   \n  “Coach Beam, although (he and the suspect) did not have a close relationship, was open to helping everybody in our community, and this is not uncommon for him to have a relationship with someone that he would think needs help,” Beere said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said Irving was on campus for a specific purpose, though they did not specify what that was. While authorities described the encounter as targeted, Beere confirmed it was not connected to a robbery.\n \n\n   \n    A champion for second chances\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s impact on the game stretched across more than four decades. He began coaching in Oakland in 1982 as Skyline High School’s defensive coordinator before joining Laney College in 2004 as the running backs coach, later becoming offensive coordinator and eventually head coach in 2012. Under his leadership, Laney won two league titles.\n \n\n   \n  His influence reached far beyond the sidelines. More than 20 of Beam’s former players went on to the NFL, including seven who played in the Super Bowl, according to his  biography on the college’s website. \n \n\n   \n  His appearance in the 2020 season of “Last Chance U” introduced his tough-love mentorship style to a national audience and cemented his status as a champion for young athletes seeking a second chance.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Netflix for comment.\n \n\n   \n  To the Bay Area, Beam was more than a coach. He was a builder of people, a steady presence, a believer in potential.\n \n\n   \n  Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee reflected on the profound impact Beam had on the community, calling his legacy one “we all have to lift up, given the way he mentored young people, people who never would have had a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Beam coached the mayor’s nephew when he attended Skyline High School, she said, calling Beam “a phenomenal human being.” His influence transcended the football field, she added; he was a mentor, a friend, and a source of guidance for students, athletes and community members from all walks of life.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor described the city’s grief, noting the outpouring of support from people across Oakland as the community struggles with the loss.\n \n\n   \n  “He was friends with everyone and encouraged everyone. He never thought anyone was a lost cause,” Lee told CNN on Friday. “People feel the void already and are grieving this loss like you would not believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Athletes across the country took to social media to mourn Beam, sharing photos and memories that capture the stunning impact he had on their lives. Chicago Bears cornerback Nahshon Wright  posted a group photo with Beam , writing simply, “Will forever miss you dawg.” New Orleans Saints cornerback Rejzohn Wright shared a  heartfelt homage,  captioning a cheerful photo of a trio posing with Beam, “Crushed.”\n \n\n   \n  “I pray my prayers strong enough,” Wright wrote over a memorial video montage of Beam guiding and inspiring his athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Both athletes shared a video from April 2023, taken days before the NFL draft, showing Beam at football practice. Wearing his signature sunglasses and mustache, he jokes with the players while offering guidance — a fleeting, tender glimpse of the warmth, humor, and care that made him much more than a coach.\n \n\n   \n  Closing his remarks during the news conference, Shavies said, “I know that if Coach were here, he’d finish by saying, ‘Two claps — ready, ready.’”\n \n\n   \n    Another life ‘stolen’ by gun violence\n \n\n   \n  Laney College was  placed on lockdown  Thursday after reports of a shooting, as police secured the area and launched an investigation. The campus reopened Friday with mental health and counseling services available, the college said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Peralta community is devastated by his shooting,” Chancellor Tammeil Gilkerson said in a message to employees. “We are stunned and heartbroken that such violence has touched our campus and one of the most respected and beloved members of our Laney, Peralta, and Oakland community.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilkerson described Beam as “a renowned coach, teacher, mentor, and leader whose impact extends far beyond athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Lee condemned the killing, saying gun violence has “stolen” another life and warning that the city cannot allow firearms to continue flooding its streets and destroying the very people “who are trying to save our community.”\n \n\n   \n  “Coach’s Beam’s legacy isn’t measured in championships or statistics,” Lee said in the statement Friday. “It’s measured in the thousands of young people he believed in, mentored, and refused to abandon … He gave Oakland’s youth their best chance, and he never stopped fighting for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident is Oakland’s second school shooting in two days.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, one juvenile was shot and two were arrested at Skyline High School,  police said . The juvenile who was shot was taken to the hospital and was in stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “It is devastating,” Lee added. “Schools should be the safest spaces in our city. We need guns off our streets now.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/halligan-james-comey-grand-jury-transcript","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:06:00-05:00","title":"Lindsey Halligan says ‘there are no missing minutes’ in grand jury transcripts in James Comey case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, raised concerns about missing minutes in the grand jury transcript related to the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey.

Can it keep its edge? \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, Joyce Jiang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:37 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As US duties on Chinese imports spun higher and higher earlier this year, Derek Wang braced for major disruption.\n \n\n   \n  With US orders ground to a halt, Wang, 36, who sells intelligent cookware out of southern China’s Guangdong province, looked elsewhere to fill the gap. After finding new buyers in Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and Cambodia, he learned what he describes as a key lesson: “Nothing is more important than the markets close to us.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories like Wang’s have played out across China’s vast economy where businesses, large and small, scrambled to fill the void after temporary triple-digit duties – and the threat of their return – upended Chinese exports to the world’s wealthiest market.\n \n\n   \n  The result has been a coup for China’s trade juggernaut.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of seeing exports falter on lost US business, the world’s largest manufacturer has driven them deeper into other markets around the world – building on the country’s global economic footprint and hedges companies made during Trump’s first trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The resilience gave Beijing confidence in its months-long negotiations with the US, which came to a head in October when leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met and agreed to a truce that whittles new tariffs on Chinese goods down to 20%.\n \n\n   \n  But the push also puts China on track to eclipse last year’s gaping nearly $1 trillion global trade surplus – a balance that’s irritated governments around the world and sparked Trump’s trade war in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  There were already questions about the sustainability of China’s export blitz before data released last week showed exports unexpectedly contracted by just over 1% year on year in October – the first downturn since February.\n \n\n   \n  Whether China can maintain its level of exports to the rest of the world – and expand back into the US market after the recent truce, is a consequential question for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues to struggle with lackluster demand from its own consumers, but doubles down on manufacturing as its economic cornerstone.\n \n\n   \n    China’s trade resilience\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, the shift in China’s export flows has been stark – and sent a clear message that, for China, the US is not irreplaceable.\n \n\n   \n  While exports to the US dropped nearly 18% in the first 10 months of this year versus that period in 2024, they were up more than 7% to the European Union, 14% to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and 26% to Africa, according to Chinese customs data released last week. Overall, exports rose 5.3%.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, that trade was buoyed by leaps in the export of machine tools, automobile parts and computer components. In Africa, construction machinery and green technologies have been key exports, analysts say, while parts of Latin America have seen significant growth in electric vehicles, chemical fertilizers and electronics, among other areas.\n \n\n   \n  This trade engine was humming before the start of the trade war.\n \n\n   \n  Already the world’s manufacturing superpower, China’s rapid climb to dominate green technologies like EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and solar panels, had driven up demand from countries looking to convert to renewable energy cheaply – and concern from those accusing China of unfair competition with subsidized products.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those goods – like EVs and solar panels – were already effectively barred from the US market by high tariffs put in place in recent years, and China’s exporters have been building out trade across developing markets.\n \n\n   \n  “(China) has prepared quite well for this,” said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at the MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t some miracle of foresight thinking to predict that the United States would escalate over time its trade and technology conflict with China, but China was (expanding markets) before the trade and tech war began, and ever since it’s started, that trend has really accelerated,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as many companies had to scramble to divert business from the US market in recent months, experts say the groundwork for the pivot was laid by Beijing’s decades-long push to build out its global economic footprint – expanding trade while also bankrolling ports, terminals and highways under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also relied on an earlier push from Chinese firms to move supply chains and production centers out of China to areas from Southeast Asia to Mexico – where goods are shipped from China to be fabricated or finished.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the key for the so-called resilience of Chinese exports,” said Yao Yang, dean of the Di-shui-hu Advanced Finance Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who noted these investments began during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Without those outbound investments, I don’t think that China can cope with the shock.”\n \n\n   \n    A two-way street?\n \n\n   \n  But Beijing’s trade resilience has also raised fears that a deluge of Chinese goods into other markets will wipe out domestic industries.\n \n\n   \n  Countries have been hitting back with probes on Chinese goods, with the US and India, as well as Mexico and Brazil, together raising 79 anti-dumping and countervailing probes against Chinese goods in the first half of this year – a significant uptick from recent years before 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also calls for exports or factory relocations to come alongside greater levels of local investment, knowledge transfer and more balanced trade.\n \n\n   \n  For some Latin American countries, “deindustrialization is a big problem when Chinese companies start to invest … because they bring just the assembly, they don’t do technology and knowledge transfer,” said Diego Rodriguez, logistics and industrial practice leader at Americas Market Intelligence, a research firm in Miami, noting countries like Brazil are pushing back against this.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, the stronger flow of goods is a concern, according to Rebecca Sta Maria, former executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel as if we are being swamped. I remember one economy saying a ‘tsunami of Chinese goods coming into ASEAN.’ Of course that’s a concern to us,” said Sta Maria, now the director of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. But it wasn’t all negative, she added, because small and medium-sized businesses were using high-end components from China, making their products more competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “I know that the Chinese government has acknowledged (the concern) to some extent, so now it’s how do we manage this?”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing denies accusations that its goods are flooding markets. Its officials have instead taken Trump’s global trade shake-up as an opportunity to tout China as the reliable trade partner, while pledging to open its vast market wider to exporters and investors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Observers say some countries may also be unwilling to throw up barriers to China at a time when they are facing higher tariffs on their own goods into the US – that’s especially when there is true demand in many countries.\n \n\n   \n  In Africa, “it’s a two-way street,” said Capital Economics emerging market analyst David Omojomolo.\n \n\n   \n  “These countries (in Africa) want to industrialize… there’s a massive electricity gap across the continent – solar panels are cheap and China’s got overcapacity … they need to send them somewhere, so of course, Africa is going to benefit.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Getting squeezed’\n \n\n   \n  Even still, manufacturers across China have struggled to fill the hole left by the drop in US exports.\n \n\n   \n  Factory employees in recent months have described to CNN canceled shifts, mandatory furloughs and lost jobs as employers deciding to relocate out of China.\n \n\n   \n  Garment maker Zhang Peipei in Jiangxi province told CNN she has been able to keep her 20-year-old business afloat through smaller revenue streams coming from outside the US. But she says the unpredictable US tariff policies have already caused “serious and irreversible long-term impact” without clear alternatives.\n \n\n   \n  With her business now hanging on whether she can cut a deal with buyers in Mexico, Zhang said she didn’t feel “very confident,” even despite a potential return of some US business now, “since the US has been shaking up the foreign trade scene, the whole world is chaotic right now.”\n \n\n   \n  And there are questions about whether China’s robust trade data this year showed true demand or a short-term push to get goods out of the country to stockpile them or ship them to the US via a third country with lower tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  An analysis of US and Chinese trade data from April to July – including the height of the trade uncertainty – suggests that just less than a quarter of China’s trade diverted from the US was likely still ultimately ending up in the US, while the rest of the goods were finding alternative markets, according to Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the RAND China Research Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Still, l’m not all that confident that the final demand for all those (other) exports going to the Global South is actually going to be remaining in those countries,” he said, noting that exporters could also be building up offshore inventories as they waited to see how countries’ trade talks with the US played out.\n \n\n   \n  “The big caveat,” he added, is that “the margins of Chinese exporters are almost certainly getting squeezed … they’re maintaining high volumes in real terms, but they’re doing it by cutting prices.”\n \n\n   \n  The recent truce between Xi and Trump leaves tariffs on Chinese goods at around 47% on average, but could see the return of more US business.\n \n\n   \n  But as uncertainty remains across the global economy, a driving focus for those in China, both in the factories and the government, will be on expanding how much the country’s own consumers buy domestic-made goods.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the case for Wang, the cookware maker in Guangdong. Despite finding new clients outside the US, he is also making another pivot, directing more of his business to China’s domestic market, and less of it outside, he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/lower-tariffs-coffee-beef-bananas-produce","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:02:00Z","title":"Trump lowers tariffs on coffee, beef and fruits, as Americans’ concerns about affordability grow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 14, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order retroactively lowering tariffs on key agricultural imports such as coffee, beef, tomatoes, and bananas, effective from Thursday.

redistricting efforts \n       \n  By Amy O’Kruk, Ethan Cohen, Renée Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  But not all states are agreeing to redraw their maps. The latest development is in Indiana, where the Republican leader of the state Senate  says there isn’t enough support  to redistrict in that state. Despite that announcement, Republican Gov. Mike Braun has continued to call for the legislature to vote on a new map.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, the Trump administration  sued California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/middleeast/gaza-rain-floods-camps-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:21:00-05:00","title":"Heavy Rainfall Floods Camps of Displaced Palestinians in Gaza","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rainfall in Gaza on November 14, 2025, flooded hundreds of tents housing displaced Palestinians, with water levels rising above 10 centimeters in many shelters.

President Donald Trump’s push  to redraw congressional lines, the Republican leader of Indiana’s state Senate on Friday said his chamber won’t meet for a special session to create additional GOP seats.\n \n\n   \n  Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said there aren’t enough votes to pass a new map.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state’s congressional maps,” Bray said in a statement. “Today, I’m announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun – who had called the special session at the behest of Trump, Vice President JD Vance and the president’s political allies – indicated he would not relent from his demand that lawmakers gather to vote on new lines.\n \n\n   \n  “I called for our legislators to convene to ensure Hoosiers’ voices in Washington, DC are not diluted by the democrats’ gerrymandering,” Braun said in a statement. “Our state senators need to do the right thing and show up to vote for fair maps. Hoosiers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on important issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Indiana is the latest stumbling block in Trump’s high-stakes quest to remake congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Republican lawmakers in Kansas also have resisted calls to open a special session to redraw the state’s congressional map, although Kansas lawmakers could weigh new lines targeting the state’s lone congressional Democrat when legislators return for their regular session early next year.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats need to gain just three seats in the US House after next year’s midterms to take control of the chamber and potentially block parts of Trump’s agenda during the final two years of his White House term.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana Republicans hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate. They also hold seven of the state’s nine congressional districts — but Trump had eyed the Democratic-held 1st District in northwestern Indiana and the 7th District in Indianapolis as possible avenues to add Republican-leaning districts and bolster his party’s narrow House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the mid-decade redistricting arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to create five additional GOP-friendly seats. So far, GOP-led mapmaking efforts have redrawn seats in four states – Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio – to add a total of nine potential seats to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Californians voted by a large margin to approve five additional Democratic-friendly districts, which represents the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state. On Thursday, the Trump administration’s Justice Department  joined a legal challenge  that seeks to block the California map from going into effect.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/federal-data-what-to-expect-economic-data","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:54:00Z","title":"The government is back open.

Several releases are reliant on data from other series. For example, CPI and Producer Price Index data points feed in to the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index ,  which in turn feeds in to GDP.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis – the statistical arm of the Commerce Department that estimates GDP and produces data on topics such as income, spending, foreign trade, and state and local economies – announced it is “working to update its schedule of economic releases” and is consulting with the Census Bureau, BLS and other suppliers of data used to produce the BEA’s indicators.\n \n\n   \n  Early Friday afternoon, the Census Bureau announced revised release dates for three reports originally slated to publish in early October. The August data on construction spending, manufacturers’ shipments and international trade will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Each economic data series will be affected differently by the shutdown, depending on how, when and from whom the data is collected, said Erica Groshen, a former BLS Commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n \n\n   \n  Still, she noted, expect the BLS and other agencies to prioritize  Principal Federal Economic Indicators , which are about three dozen major statistical series used to describe the condition of the US economy. (The jobs report, CPI, PPI, and PCE are among these. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover  Survey , for example, is not).\n \n\n   \n    Will we ever see the October jobs report?\n \n\n   \n  As it stands now, October 2025 could very well amount to a “lost” month of data – or close to it.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, the nation’s statistical agencies were run by skeleton crews as the actions of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data were suspended – disrupting finely tuned processes that have underpinned major economic reports for decades.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the jobs report is composed by two surveys: one of businesses and one of households. The establishment survey is primarily automated and relies upon online portals for businesses to submit their information such as workforce levels and pay. The household survey, on the other hand, is largely conducted via telephone and in-person visits.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to ask people what their situation was five weeks ago, and it’s bound to be unreliable,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “I think part of the employment report for the month of October will be lost forever, and we will only get the data that is submitted by companies.”\n \n\n   \n  The household survey is what’s used to generate labor force estimates and the unemployment rate ,  and since that wasn’t conducted in October, “we’re going to get half the employment report,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett  said on Thursday . “We’ll get the jobs part, but we won’t get the unemployment rate.”\n \n\n   \n  The lack of a complete monthly employment snapshot isn’t ideal when the US labor market entered the shutdown on seemingly shaky ground; however, a rough picture of the trajectory could still be assembled   using the payroll estimates combined with a smattering of private hiring data as well as state-level unemployment filings and layoff notices, wrote Mike Reid, senior US economist at RBC in a note Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    October inflation data likely to be quite opaque\n \n\n   \n  The  visibility on inflation  data for October will be “particularly bad,” Reid noted.\n \n\n   \n  Two-thirds of the pricing data that feeds in to the CPI is collected by in-person visits to brick-and-mortar stores, Reid said. Wholesale-level prices also were not collected in October for the Producer Price Index.\n \n\n   \n  That will then ripple through to the PCE price index, where about 90% is constructed from CPI and PPI inputs, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike the labor market, there are few (if any) reliable alternatives to the CPI report,” he said. “Absent the CPI and PPI reports, it’s hard to gauge inflation’s trajectory.”\n \n\n   \n  And if the October inflation data is released, it could pose a “serious data quality issue,” as it would likely lean more heavily on  imputation , a methodology that utilizes a variety of existing datapoints to capture missing information.\n \n\n   \n  “But we know that already when the statistical agencies have all the data available, there’s a big degree of uncertainty, and sometimes the numbers are not statistically significant,” EY-Parthenon’s Daco told CNN. “So, with even less data, the statistical significance of these numbers is likely to drop even further.”\n \n\n   \n    What about November data?\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown lasted through nearly half of November, meaning that this month’s data also will not emerge unscathed, economists said. However, they also fully expect all major reports to be released.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a greater likelihood that inflation data will have a higher level of imputations, noted RBC’s Reid. The timing and staffing levels of returning BLS employees also could impact the collection of data, including the household survey for the jobs report, said former BLS Commissioner Groshen.\n \n\n   \n  “BLS has fewer resources this time, because it is down 20% in its staffing, one-third of its leadership positions are vacant, and it’s possible they had even more people quit during the course of the shutdown,” she said, referencing the Trump administration’s large-scale layoff of federal workers earlier this year via the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while it’s possible that the surveying of households in November could include questions for October, it’s unlikely, she said, noting current staffing levels and the heft of the data backlog facing statistical agencies.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a very highly orchestrated way that those interviews are conducted, so just even running surveys simultaneously is problematic,” she said. “I would not be surprised if the Census Bureau and BLS just decided that they can’t run the October [household survey] again.”\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it’s possible that the BLS could estimate the October unemployment rate from the September and November data, she said.\n \n\n   \n    We might not be back on track until 2026\n \n\n   \n  “Noisy” reports aren’t out of the ordinary for major economic releases such as the jobs report. Large disruptions, including those considered relatively short term, have a way of leaving their mark on data for months (or, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, for years).\n \n\n   \n  Entering into evidence are the October 2024 and November 2024 jobs reports.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, a month impacted by two major deadly hurricanes and massive labor strikes, the initial employment snapshot showed a net gain of  just 12,000 jobs  – a far cry from September’s 223,000-job gain.\n \n\n   \n  It was also a one-time blip.\n \n\n   \n  After striking workers and weather-waylaid employees went back to work in November, the jobs report for that month showed  a surge of 227,000 jobs gained .\n \n\n   \n  When the October 2025 jobs report is released, it’s expected to show significant job losses – perhaps to the tune of 1.5 million jobs, RBC’s Reid estimates – largely because of federal workers who were not on payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  And, with the shutdown ending during the week that includes the 12th of the month – the period the BLS uses to tabulate employment – the November jobs report should capture the return of those employees and contractors to payrolls.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown gummed up the nation’s statistical machinery, and it could take a couple of weeks for everything to get sorted out and running smoothly again.\n \n\n   \n  “It’ll likely be the February period, where we get the January data, before we get our first real clean look at the US macroeconomic data,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “So, there’s a price to be paid there in terms of the quantity and quality of the data that we’re going to get until early winter 2026.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street is bracing for impact\n \n\n   \n  The privately produced data provided a sense of what the federal data could show; however, if those expectations are dashed, there is potential for wide swings in the markets, said Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  “If they hit the mark, and that’s what they show, then no harm, no foul,” he said. “If, though, the numbers come out and vary from what we expect – either on the upside on the downside – then that may call into question the Fed policy that’s been done since the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  US stocks had  their worst day in a month  Thursday and were lower Friday as traders digested news that the government had reopened. Investors braced for weeks’ worth of data set to be released in short order.\n \n\n   \n  “I say this only half-jokingly: Maybe because the government is opening up again, the market took a dive,” economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research told CNN’s Matt Egan. “When the government was shut down we could believe whatever we wanted to believe. Now we need to be data dependent and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/opioid-settlement-oxycontin-purdue-sackler","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:32:00Z","title":"Judge Approves Opioid Settlement Between Purdue Pharma and Sackler Family","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal bankruptcy court judge has approved a $7 billion settlement between Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, resolving thousands of lawsuits related to the opioid crisis.

settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue and Sackler family \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic.\n \n\n   \n  The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion and give up ownership. The new agreement replaces one the US Supreme Court  rejected  last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies that totaled about $50 billion. It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could “conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.” But without that possibility, he said: “The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.”\n \n\n   \n    The opposition is much quieter this time around\n \n\n   \n  The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.\n \n\n   \n  The US Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for  Sackler family members  to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don’t opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there’s been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn’t vote.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn’t bar prosecutors from pursuing.\n \n\n   \n  A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn’t enough.\n \n\n   \n  “The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.\n \n\n   \n    Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements\n \n\n   \n  A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There’s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven’t had a say.\n \n\n   \n  The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026.\n \n\n   \n  There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from  museums  and  universities .\n \n\n   \n  And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.\n \n\n   \n    Some people hurt by Purdue’s opioids would receive some money\n \n\n   \n  Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue’s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.\n \n\n   \n  All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. It would take up to 15 years for governments to receive their full allocations.\n \n\n   \n  About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue’s opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive.\n \n\n   \n  People will have until March 1 to agree not to sue the Sacklers and apply for the funds.\n \n\n   \n  One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn’t help people with substance use disorder.\n \n\n   \n  “Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can’t do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. “Some Sacklers are bad people,” he said, “but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers  have been dropping  in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/uk/banksy-girl-with-balloon-theft-man-jailed-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00Z","title":"Man Jailed for Stealing Banksy’s 'Girl with Balloon' Print in Smash-and-Grab London Robbery","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 49-year-old man, Larry Fraser, was sentenced to 13 months in prison for stealing a signed print of Banksy’s iconic 'Girl with Balloon' artwork during a smash-and-grab robbery at the Grove Gallery in London’s Fitzrovia neighborhood.

A man has been sentenced to more than a year in prison for stealing a signed print of Banksy’s “Girl with Balloon” artwork in a smash-and-grab theft from a London gallery.\n \n\n   \n  Larry Fraser, 49, was sentenced to 13 months in prison on Friday for stealing the 2004 print – worth £270,000 (about $355,000) – from the Grove Gallery in the British capital’s upmarket neighborhood of Fitzrovia last September, according to London’s Metropolitan Police.\n \n\n   \n  Police said Fraser had pleaded guilty to one count of non-residential burglary.\n \n\n   \n  “Met Flying Squad officers worked tirelessly to identify the suspect and managed to track him to a location several streets away, where he was revealed to be Fraser,” police said in a statement Friday. “They even caught him on CCTV loading the artwork into a van before fleeing the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  The Flying Squad, a specialist unit within the Metropolitan Police tasked with investigating serious organized crime, recovered the artwork within four days, following Fraser’s arrest and “covert enquiries,” police said.\n \n\n   \n  Art recovery expert Arthur Brand told CNN that it was notable that the stolen artwork was a

strikes appear quite unpopular, as Americans again support due process \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:08 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump began rapidly deporting migrants earlier this year to a brutal Salvadoran prison – including  some wrongfully so  – without due process, Democrats were  somewhat wary of pushing back .\n \n\n   \n  Yes, the move appeared illegal and highly problematic. But didn’t Americans just want undocumented immigrants deported? By standing up for due process, didn’t Democrats risk looking like they were siding with people in the country illegally – or even alleged gang members?\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turned out Americans could separate those two things in their minds. In large part because of the heavy-handedness of his deportations, Trump’s immigration agenda has suffered a series of defeats in court and  fallen out of favor  with the public.\n \n\n   \n  Despite reducing the number of illegal border-crossings to  record lows , Trump is somehow  underwater on immigration  polling.\n \n\n   \n  We could now be seeing a similar dynamic playing out with Trump’s  legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats  in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out these strikes without a legal process or offering public evidence of its justifications. The administration has likened the fight against drug-traffickers to a literal war and  said that allows it  to use war-like powers.\n \n\n   \n  Despite carrying out these strikes for more than two months and  killing 80 people now , we hadn’t had a good read on public opinion – until now. And it turns out, much like with the rapid deportations, the American public has real concerns.\n \n\n   \n  A new  Reuters-Ipsos poll  released Friday found Americans oppose such strikes by a wide margin, 51%-29%.\n \n\n   \n  The question asked whether people supported “authorizing the US military to kill suspected drug traffickers outside of the US without judicial process.”\n \n\n   \n  Independents opposed this 53%-22%. About twice as many Americans overall strongly opposed it (34%) as strongly supported it (15%). And even 27% of Republicans opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  Those are the kinds of numbers that would seem to suggest real political danger for Trump – and might embolden Democrats or other critics to start speaking out a little more forcefully.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the extraordinary nature of these strikes and major legal questions hanging over them, those critics thus far have been relatively quiet. And they certainly haven’t sought to elevate this issue to a top priority.\n \n\n   \n  We do have the likes of libertarian Republican Sen. Rand Paul speaking out pretty forcefully. Paul has called the strikes “extrajudicial killings.” He and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with nearly all Senate Democrats last month to rein in Trump’s authority on the boat strikes, although the measure ultimately did not pass.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawmakers have agitated for more briefings from the administration, which hasn’t publicly offered a legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s clear Democrats have decided to treat the issue somewhat gently, perhaps fearing they will look like they’re standing up for drug-traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, even  expressed confidence in the underlying intelligence . Warner suggested that, whatever other concerns people have about the strikes – and he expressed worries himself about the administration’s transparency – they shouldn’t be too concerned about them hitting innocent people.\n \n\n   \n  But just days later, the Associated Press reported that some who were killed in the strikes appear to have been  small-time criminals and amateurs , rather than the “narco-terrorists” the administration has said it’s targeting.\n \n\n   \n  This appears very much a live issue that will keep evolving. And the survey suggests those who would raise concerns have plenty of the public behind them.\n \n\n   \n  But actually, that shouldn’t be too surprising.\n \n\n   \n  Over and over again, polls have suggested the American people are actually quite interested in upholding the principle of due process – the principle that says, yes, these might be criminals, but we should probably make sure of that and have some accountability. And that even goes for noncitizens.\n \n\n   \n  A May  Public Religion Research Institute poll  showed Americans opposed the government deporting undocumented migrants to prisons in El Salvador and other countries “without allowing them to challenge their deportation in court,” 61%-37%.\n \n\n   \n  A June  poll from Vanderbilt University  showed support for deportations dropped from 51% to 39% when you add the qualifier that it would be done “without a formal hearing before a judge in an immigration court.”\n \n\n   \n  And a May  Reuters-Ipsos poll  showed Americans said 55%-41% that people suspected of being in the country illegally were entitled to due process. Independents agreed with that 63%-36%, and even 22% of Republicans agreed.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll see if these data – and perhaps the recent election results suggesting Trump is at a low point politically – inject lawmakers with more willingness to fight this battle.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, the downside of not speaking out more forcefully also appears to be coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Just this week, a report from human rights groups alleged that dozens of Venezuelans who were sent to the El Salvador prison were  subjected to torture  and other serious abuses like sexual violence. The report also echoed previous reporting that, contrary to the administration’s claims, there is little evidence many of these migrants were the hardened criminals or gang members the administration said they were.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, you could understand why Americans might be skeptical of not just imprisoning people without due process, but killing them.\n \n\n   \n  And it seems they are.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/charlotte-gregory-bovino-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:30:00Z","title":"CBP Official Gregory Bovino Heading to Charlotte, North Carolina, Sparking Local Concerns Over Immigration Enforcement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration, is reportedly heading to Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of a broader immigration enforcement campaign targeting Democratic-led cities.

That was news to city officials \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:30 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcolm Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers  to head to Charlotte , then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  “As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden – who initially was unaware of the operation – has been “contacted by two separate federal oﬃcials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week,” the sheriff’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office said details on the federal operation have not been shared with them and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The plans have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  US Rep. Alma Adams, whose district includes much of Charlotte, wrote she was “extremely concerned about the deployment of U.S. Border Patrol and ICE agents to Charlotte” in  a post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and what we have seen border patrol and ICE agents do in places like Chicago and Los Angeles – using excessive force in their operations and tear gassing peaceful protesters – threatens the wellbeing of the communities they enter,” Adams said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Bovino  wrote , “Immigrants rest assured, we have your back like we did in Chicago and Los Angeles,” and urged undocumented immigrants to  self-deport .\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are not involved in planning federal operations, nor have they been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in federal immigration operations and would only get involved when there are warrants or criminal behavior under its jurisdiction, so “people who need local law enforcement services should feel secure calling 911,” said Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We still don’t know any details on where they may be operating and to what extent,” Lyles  said  Thursday. “I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Lyles asked residents to refrain from sharing unverified information about enforcement activities, which create “more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the federal government has not confirmed Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year, have created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein encouraged residents who see inappropriate behavior to record it on their phones and notify local law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “We should all focus on and arrest violent criminals and drug traffickers. Unfortunately, that’s not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,” the governor said in a statement. “The vast majority of people they have detained have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials were in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out to the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting a Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/nnsa-nuclear-testing-white-house-meeting-exclusive","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00Z","title":"Exclusive: Department of Energy officials to meet with White House to tamp down Trump’s idea of explosive nuclear testing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Department of Energy officials, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright and National Nuclear Security Administration leader Brandon M.

Williams and officials from the US National Laboratories are planning to inform the White House that they do not think blowing up weapons for nuclear warhead testing,   as Trump suggested last month, is tenable, two sources familiar with the matter said. They asked not to be named to discuss a sensitive matter.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest sign of fallout from Trump’s October social media post instructing the Department of Defense to start testing   nuclear weapons “because of other countries testing programs.”\n \n\n   \n  But NNSA, which falls under the Department of Energy,   is the federal agency responsible for building and testing bombs and maintaining the nuclear stockpile, not the Defense Department.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official reiterated on Thursday that “because of other countries’ testing programs, President Trump has instructed the Department of War and Department of Energy to test our nuclear weapons on an equal basis.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing has been eliminated from consideration as all decision-making authority lies with the President,” the White House official added.\n \n\n   \n  Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich pushed back on the idea that agency officials would be dissuading the White House from resuming testing.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump administration continues to explore all options as it moves to expand nuclear testing on an equal basis with other nations,” Dietderich said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the US tests every part of its nuclear weapons systems except for the explosive nuclear material in warheads. The last full-scale nuclear weapons test was done in the US in 1992, and the practice was banned by former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent suggestion the US could resume nuclear testing comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted in October that Moscow had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo.\n \n\n   \n  “The reason I’m saying — testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test,” Trump told “60 Minutes” recently. “If you notice, North Korea’s testing constantly. Other countries are testing,” he said, adding: “I don’t wanna be the only country that doesn’t test.”\n \n\n   \n  At the upcoming White House meeting, NNSA and DOE officials will be prepared to tell the administration that “there’s not going to be any testing” involving exploding nuclear materials and will seek to steer the White House into a workable plan that doesn’t involve blowing anything up, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  The source said officials hoped it would give the president the opportunity to align himself with NNSA’s approach.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has the authority to order the tests anyway if he doesn’t agree with the nuclear experts.\n \n\n   \n  An NNSA spokesperson declined to comment. “NNSA does not comment on ongoing or potential private meetings with the White House, especially regarding matters of nuclear security,” NNSA spokesperson Mariza Smajlaj told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Mere minutes before he was due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Korea last month, Trump took to Truth Social to say that he had directed the “Department of War” to “start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Inside the NNSA, Trump’s initial October suggestion was met with confusion, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody saw this coming,” one of them said.\n \n\n   \n  Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, told Fox News  earlier this month  that US nuclear tests are “system tests” and “not nuclear explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  A senior White House official, when pressed this week on what exactly the president meant by his initial comments, told CNN that Trump was being “purposefully vague” in his calls to resume nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The official argued the president became fixated on the idea while on his trip to Asia, telling CNN that some foreign leaders brought the issue up to Trump directly while he was abroad.  \n \n\n   \n  Another   administration official argued that they viewed the president’s comments as wanting to do more testing on nuclear-capable missiles, rather than detonating nuclear bombs.\n \n\n   \n  So far, Trump’s comments haven’t changed agency policy: No plans are underway for exploding nuclear weapons for testing purposes. One source told CNN that no one in the administration has explained to those in the agency what exactly Trump meant by his comments.\n \n\n   \n  NNSA officials recently prepared a memo for Wright and Williams outlining all the things the agency does to make sure its weapons are up to speed, including supercomputer bomb simulations and test flights of non-explosive warheads, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That memo also lays out what the timeline would be if the administration directed NNSA to go back to nuclear testing like Trump had suggested. One source said it would take 36 months of underground testing at a minimum to obtain scientifically useful data, but that timeline could get much longer if the federal government were sued by environmental or other groups to delay or stop the testing.\n \n\n   \n  “If they wanted to just make the ground shake, you could probably do that sooner, but there wouldn’t be a purpose to the test beyond political signaling,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  If the US returned to nuclear testing, it would be done in Nevada – at the only underground site designed to explode nuclear weapons. That space sits on federal land in a vast desert, but the state government would also need to sign off on the testing – another thorny issue.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a big resistance from states about dealing with nuclear materials like we used to,” the source said.\n \n\n   \n  There is also the matter of legacy cleanup of nuclear waste due to decades of nuclear testing in Nevada. Testing has had devastating health impacts on nearby downwind communities, from radiation exposure to illnesses like cancer.\n \n\n   \n  There is no need for weapons testing, as the US still has a lot of “really good data” from Cold War-era nuclear testing, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  There are concerns that if the US resumed testing, China could also use it as an excuse to perform nuclear   tests — something it says  it is not currently doing  — raising the geopolitical temperature across the globe.\n \n\n   \n  Neither Beijing nor Moscow have tested a nuclear warhead in many decades, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about whether the Trump administration has more intelligence on Russia and China’s nuclear activities than what is publicly known, a person who worked in the West Wing during Trump’s first term, including on national security issues, told CNN: “It would be hard for either country to blow up nuclear warheads underground and keep that quiet. That’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/walmart-doug-mcmillon-customers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:37:00-05:00","title":"How Walmart’s CEO Made It the Store for Literally Everyone","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Under CEO Doug McMillon’s leadership from 2014 to 2025, Walmart transformed from a discount retailer focused on low-income shoppers into a widely accessible 'everything store' for all income levels.

The company’s stock recently hit all-time highs. Sales are surging, even as rivals such as Target, Home Depot and others slump. And Walmart raised wages and expanded benefits, becoming a business school  case study  on employee retention.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that is thanks to McMillon, who announced Friday that he’s  retiring  soon as CEO. He oversaw Walmart’s transformation from a brick-and-mortar discount superstore that largely appealed to lower-income Americans to an everything store, everywhere for everyone.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon, a Walmart lifer who took the top job at 47 as the company’s youngest CEO since founder Sam Walton, reinvented Walmart by threading one of the thinnest needles in retail: reaching new shoppers online while retaining old customers in stores. Walmart under McMillon used its unparalleled size to press suppliers into keeping prices ultra-low, all while adding new higher-end brands and growing online to attract a wealthier clientele.\n \n\n   \n  And McMillon accomplished this pivot while navigating contentious political and social issues in America that have engulfed many companies, such as Target and Bud Light.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon’s successor, veteran Walmart leader John Furner, will have to handle these challenges, as well as pressure from President Donald Trump’s tariffs and an uncertain future of shopping with AI.  Walmart  recently said it’s partnering with OpenAI to let users browse and make purchases directly through chatbot ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n    Walmart’s transformation\n \n\n   \n  Low and middle-income shoppers historically formed the customer base of Walmart’s superstores in rural and suburban America.\n \n\n   \n  But Walmart has increasingly drawn higher-income customers in recent years. Shoppers making more than $100,000 a year have  fueled  Walmart’s growth in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart’s grocery business has underpinned its success. More than half of Walmart’s sales come from groceries, and the company has used its size and scale to muscle down prices and  invest  in improving its meat and produce aisles. That has benefitted Walmart throughout McMillon’s tenure, particularly during the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent America searching for value that Walmart could help deliver.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Walmart under McMillon has built a strong e-commerce business to compete with Amazon and draw shoppers online. It has added the option to buy online and pick up in store to thousands of its locations and Walmart+, its same-day grocery delivery membership.\n \n\n   \n  Although Amazon leads e-commerce sales in the United States by a wide margin, accounting for 40.6% of sales,  Walmart comes in second  with 9.4%, according to market research firm eMarketer.\n \n\n   \n  “The most notable change during McMillon’s tenure has been Walmart’s evolution into a major e-commerce company,” said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Placer.ai.\n \n\n   \n    Political culture wars\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also has deftly steered Walmart through political culture wars on guns, LGBTQ rights, immigration, the Confederate flag and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  Walmart, historically a conservative company based in deep-red Arkansas, appeals to a wide swath of America.\n \n\n   \n  It has worked carefully to stake out positions in the political middle to avoid offending customers and employees, and taken a slow, gradual approach to changing policies such as  gun and ammunition  sales. Dan Bartlett, the former communications director for President George W. Bush, has helped shape Walmart’s do-no-harm public affairs strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “Politics moves around,” McMillon  said  in a 2017 interview. “We are on our 11th administration, since Walmart was born. There will be a 12th.

  \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:08 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For months, it felt like nothing could knock stocks off their steady ascent — but November has been a rough month on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down almost 3.5% this month and on track for its first losing month since March. The Nasdaq has shed roughly $1.74 trillion in market value in two weeks as investors have dumped tech stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks opened sharply lower Friday before bouncing off their lows as investors bought the dip. The major indexes wavered into the closing bell. The Nasdaq turned positive and closed higher by 0.13% after briefly falling almost 1.9%. The S&P 500 fluctuated and closed lower by 0.05%. The Dow fell 310 points, or 0.65%.\n \n\n   \n  “Stocks were set for another horrific session at the open following yesterday’s debacle but investors saw the sharp dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  The benchmark S&P 500 is still down 1.55% this month while the Dow is down 0.87%. The S&P 500 has shed more than $1.3 trillion in market value in just over two weeks as it has retreated from a record high set in late October.\n \n\n   \n  After months of gains, investors have outsized expectations, making them easer to disappoint. Tech stocks have become  relatively pricey .\n \n\n   \n  And after the government shutdown halted official data releases for weeks, investors are unsure what the new figures,  as government releases resume,  will show about the state of the world’s biggest economy. That, in turn, is stoking uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in December, and adding to the Wall Street jitters.\n \n\n   \n  “When the government was shut down, we could believe whatever we wanted to believe,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN’s Matt Egan. “Now we need to be data dependent, and that may not be as much fun.”\n \n\n   \n  Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence carried the market to new record highs this year. But now some investors are hitting pause, taking profits and reassessing whether those stocks will continue to produce superior returns.\n \n\n   \n  “With lofty valuations in AI-related stocks, it’s understandable that investors are on edge about anything that might go wrong,” Yardeni wrote in a Thursday note.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin, which can serve as a gauge of how risk-on investors are feeling, slid 4% on Friday and hovered around $94,500. The cryptocurrency has tumbled 25% since it hit a record high in early October.\n \n\n   \n    Data deluge incoming\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street and the Fed are awaiting a deluge of economic data that was delayed due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  That is contributing to mounting nerves about the Fed’s next move. Traders on Friday were pricing a 46% chance the central bank will cut rates in December, down from a 96% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the last policy meeting, in October, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cast some doubt on whether the Fed would cut rates again this year. Fed officials — including Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who is a voter on policy moves this year — delivered remarks this week that have shown hesitancy to continue cutting rates.\n \n\n   \n  While Evercore ISI analysts in a note said they still see an interest rate cut next month, they think it’s “very hard to call” because of a combination of factors, including “data blindness.”\n \n\n   \n  The central bank’s rate cuts in September and October boosted stocks, and a pause on rate cuts could pose troubles for stocks that have rallied on expectations for lower borrowing costs — in particular, the AI and tech stocks that have propelled the market higher.\n \n\n   \n  “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday, according to  CNN’s Fear and Greed index .\n \n\n   \n  But some investors say a pullback in stocks can also be healthy.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq gained every month from April through the end of October. Now, the market is resetting as investors reassess the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “This (pullback) is somewhat overdue, and I don’t think it’s the start of a  correction ,” Yardeni said.\n \n\n   \n    AI jitters\n \n\n   \n  There is also increasing skepticism about whether Big Tech companies can make enough money to justify the enormous spending taking place on AI deals now.\n \n\n   \n  “The technology sector has faced selling pressure in recent weeks amid concerns over rising debt issuance and a surge in capital expenditures” like new data centers, Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, told CNN’s Matt Egan in an email. “Investors are questioning whether these investments will translate into future profitability.”\n \n\n   \n  Oracle shares ( ORCL ) surged 36% in one day on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Shares in Oracle have tumbled since then, erasing those gains.\n \n\n   \n  “Companies announcing large supply deals with OpenAI have similarly been met with skepticism around OpenAI’s ability to deliver on its financial objectives,” John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Oracle facing pressure. Meta shares ( META ) are down 23% since hitting a record high in mid-August. Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) are down 10% since hitting a record high in late October. Palantir shares ( PLTR ) are down 16% since hitting a record high on November 3.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s happened recently in the market isn’t even close to a tech wreck, but it may be a bit of a tech reckoning,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team.\n \n\n   \n  To Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, this month has been defined by investors rotating out of tech stocks and into other sectors.\n \n\n   \n  The recent pullback, he said, feels like “investors trying to protect profits after a really healthy run off the lows in April.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-student-murders-restitution","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-06:00","title":"Convicted killer Bryan Kohberger must reimburse families for their daughters’ urns","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty in June 2025 to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students—Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Maddie Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves—must now reimburse the families of Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen for the cost of their urns, totaling approximately $3,000.

  1:22 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Bryan Kohberger  must pay for the urns of two of the University of Idaho students he killed, an Idaho state judge ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s ruling comes after prosecutors asked the judge at a hearing last month to require the convicted killer to pay about $3,000 to reimburse the families of  Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen  for the urns carrying their ashes.\n \n\n   \n  Kohberger, who was set to go to trial in the summer, struck a deal with prosecutors in June that allowed him to escape the death penalty if he  pleaded guilty to the November 2022 murders  of Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Mogen and Goncalves.\n \n\n   \n  Kohberger’s attorneys argued he does not have the money to pay the additional restitution to the families, let alone the already-agreed-upon more than $30,000 in restitution   required through his plea agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Steven Hippler said in a written ruling that Kohberger can raise the money through donations or a job in prison to cover the additional funeral costs.\n \n\n   \n  The judge noted Kohberger amassed nearly $29,000 from several hundred donations since his arrest in a case that drew national attention with a cross-country manhunt following the fatal, nighttime stabbings that stunned a college town. Kohberger’s defense team has said most of the money came from his family members paying to communicate with him in jail and public donations have slowed since he pleaded guilty to the killings.\n \n\n   \n  “While these funds may no longer be available to Defendant, it is foreseeable he will continue to receive donations in the future, particularly given that much of the donated amounts came from his family,” Hippler wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, there is no reason Defendant cannot secure prison employment for remuneration. Given his limited needs in prison and his youth, it is foreseeable that through employment and donations, Defendant may receive sufficient amounts over his life to at least come close to meeting his financial restitution obligations.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/sweden-bus-crash-fatalities-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:37:00.000-05:00","title":"Several people killed in bus crash in Stockholm, police say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bus crash in central Stockholm on Friday resulted in six casualties, with no passengers on board at the time.

The private equity firm was set to invest in The Telegraph’s digital operation in a bid to expand the outlet’s foothold in the US and grow subscriptions overall.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph’s sale was long stymied by the British government’s restrictions on foreign government investments in media ownership, which capped foreign state-owned investments into a publisher at 15%.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird, with the help of International Media Investments (IMI) — an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed   a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family — helped the Barclay family regain control of The Telegraph in December 2023, but the British government barred the transfer of ownership.\n \n\n   \n  The May 2025 deal would have allowed IMI to retain a 15% investment, meeting that limit. However, The Telegraph’s own journalists have  questioned RedBird’s ties to China . In August, a coalition of human rights and freedom of expression organisations raised similar concerns in  an open letter  to Britain’s secretary of state for culture, media and sport.\n \n\n   \n  RedBird has denied the alleged ties to Beijing. IMI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with RedBird out of the picture, the right-leaning media empire’s future returns to a state of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “Our immediate priority is to minimise disruption to the business and work with all stakeholders, including DCMS, towards a solution,” a spokesperson for   Telegraph Media Group Holdings   told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:31:00-05:00","title":"School shootings in the US: Fast facts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of November 14, 2025, the United States has experienced 68 school shootings, including 39 on college campuses and 29 on K–12 school grounds, resulting in 26 deaths and over 100 injuries.

All incidents of gun violence are included if they occurred on school property, from kindergartens through colleges/universities, and at least one person was shot, not including the shooter. School property includes but is not limited to, buildings, fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses. Accidental discharges of firearms are included, as long as at least one person is shot, but not if the sole shooter is law enforcement or school security.\n \n\n   \n  In the first year of the pandemic, when schools were closed, there was a major decline in gun violence incidents on school grounds.

There were at least 83 incidents in 2024, but   2022 was one of the deadliest years, with 47 fatalities, according to CNN’s analysis.

Jamie Raskin alleged correspondence between Maxwell and her lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Leah Saffian, a California-based attorney who has long-represented Maxwell, said in  a statement : “The release to the media by Congressman Raskin (Dem., Maryland), of Ms. Maxwell’s privileged client-attorney email correspondence with me is as improper as it is a denial of justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Saffian added that employees at the prison have been met with “appropriate consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have been terminated for improper, unauthorized access to the email system used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to allow inmates to communicate with the outside world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Bryan prison, Bureau of Prisons and the Justice Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,  released  what he said was information about Maxwell’s life inside the Bryan prison — including  special privileges  being afforded to the late-Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman — that was shared with Raskin by a whistleblower.\n \n\n   \n  The whistleblower also told Raskin that Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, is in the process of preparing to file an application for commutation. According to an email that the whistleblower shared with the committee, Maxwell wrote to Saffian in early October that she planned to send materials “through the warden.”\n \n\n   \n  House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Friday defended how they received and released the information and disputed that the correspondence was privileged.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Judiciary Committee Minority’s letter was based on a range of documents and information shared with Committee staff by a whistleblower. None of the documents shared with the Committee from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) TRULINCS system was subject to the attorney client privilege,” a House Judiciary Democratic spokeswoman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The spokeswoman pointed out that individuals have to accept a disclaimer that their activity will be monitored once logging into the prison’s systems. She said the disclaimer makes clear that DOJ may monitor the system and that users must consent to such monitoring and have no expectation that communications will stay private.\n \n\n   \n  Pertaining to attorney client privilege specifically, the Judiciary spokeswoman said the disclaimer includes this or similar language: “I understand and consent that this provision applies to electronic messages both to and from my attorney or other legal representative, and that such electronic messages will not be treated as privileged communications, and that I have alternative methods of conducting privileged legal communication.”\n \n\n   \n  Raskin offered no description of the whistleblower — a typical practice meant to protect the person’s identity. The Democratic spokeswoman added the committee “won’t comment on any information that could identify whistleblowers, including whistleblowers’ employment status” and decried “any effort by BOP to intimidate, silence, or retaliate against anyone” who shared information.\n \n\n   \n  In her Friday statement, Saffian also wrote: “Contrary to Rep. Raskin’s assertion, Ms. Maxwell has not requested a commutation — or made a Pardon — application to the second Trump Administration. Prior to any such application a Prisoner needs to demonstrate that all possible avenues of appeal have been exhausted.”\n \n\n   \n  (Raskin did not say Maxwell had requested a commutation or pardon application; he said Maxwell was in the process of working on a commutation application.)\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/americas/brazil-protesters-cop30-climate-talks-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:03:00.000-05:00","title":"Protesters Block Main Entrance to COP30 Climate Talks in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, around 100 Indigenous protesters from the Munduruku group blocked the main entrance for 90 minutes, demanding a meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and calling for the cancellation of deforestation-linked development projects.

We refuse to be sacrificed for agribusiness,’’ protesters said in a written statement in Portuguese released by the Munduruku Ipereg Ayu Movement. “Our forest is not for sale. We are the ones who protect the climate, and the Amazon cannot continue to be destroyed to enrich large corporations.”\n \n\n   \n  Munduruku leaders had a series of demands for Brazil. They included revoking plans for commercial development of rivers, canceling a grain railway project that has raised fears of deforestation and clearer demarcations of Indigenous territories. They also want a rejection of deforestation carbon credits.\n \n\n   \n  During the 90 minutes of blockage, conference participants were rerouted and delegates entered the venue through another door. U.N. staff rushed to move metal detectors to the side entrance as hundreds of people formed long lines. The protest at the front of the venue began at around 7:30 a.m., with the main entrance blocked about 30 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  Conference president André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, met with the group as they blocked the entrance. He cradled a protester’s baby in his arms as he talked, smiling and nodding. After a prolonged discussion, do Lago and the protesters moved away from the entrance together.

Donald J. Trump, et al. was filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County,” Skandalakis wrote in a statement Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said.\n \n\n   \n  “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment. Out of respect for their privacy and professional discretion, I will not identify those prosecutors or disclose their reasons for declining,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  A status/pretrial conference has been scheduled for December 1 with Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee, but the accused defendants are not required to attend.\n \n\n   \n  “The State should be prepared to announce whether it intends to seek a superseding indictment,” McAfee wrote in Friday’s notice calling for the conference.\n \n\n   \n  Skandalakis said he just recently received the investigative file from Willis’ office, including 101 boxes of documents delivered to him on October 29 and an eight-terabyte hard drive just over a week ago on November 6. Willis’ office declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  “With Judge McAfee’s deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case. This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed,” Skandalakis wrote on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Michael J. Moore, former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, is skeptical the case will move ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “If the history between the Trump cases and Mr. Skandalakis foretells the future, these cases are dead on arrival,” he said. Moore also said he expects to see a recitation of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision as a basis for declining and dismissal, and is not surprised that no other prosecutor stepped forward. Moore referred to the cases as “overcharged” by using RICO.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be a thankless job, akin to being invited to the center ring at the circus and then told that your job was to clean up after the elephants,” Moore said.\n \n\n   \n  The  historic state racketeering charges  were filed on August 14, 2023, by Willis, an elected Democrat who launched a lengthy investigation into Trump’s alleged interference in the Georgia election in early 2021. The investigation began shortly after a  January phone call  became public in which Trump pressured Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to “find” the votes necessary for him to win the state in the Presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  “This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end. We remain confident that a fair and impartial review will lead to a dismissal of the case against President Trump,” Trump’s lead Georgia attorney Steve Sadow told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile case by the Fulton County prosecutor peaked in dramatic fashion when Trump surrendered in the Atlanta jail for a little over 20 minutes in August 2023, where he was forced to provide his mug shot for the first time. The case was seen as the most likely of the various criminal charges surrounding Trump to go to trial because it was a state case handled by a local Georgia prosecutor, rather than federal charges that could be pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was charged alongside 18 co-defendants on sweeping charges using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the state law commonly  referred to as RICO , similar to the federal version of the statute that was famously used to target criminal enterprises like the mafia.\n \n\n   \n  After a long-running investigation, Willis accused Trump and his allies of breaking several laws by participating in a conspiracy to unlawfully change the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n \n\n   \n    Several Trump allies involved in case\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the president, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was the highest-ranking official charged, along with former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who reached an agreement with two Georgia election officials this year to  settle a nearly $150 million defamation lawsuit.  \n \n\n   \n  Trump and his accused co-defendants “joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome” of the election, prosecutors alleged in the indictment, which said they “unlawfully conspired and endeavored to conduct and participate in criminal enterprise” after Trump lost the election in Georgia to Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  Sadow, Trump’s lead Georgia defense attorney on the case, vigorously maintained his client’s innocence during the ongoing legal process, along with attorneys who represented many of the co-defendants also charged in the unique racketeering conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants vehemently denied any wrongdoing, some arguing they were simply trying to rectify what they believed were serious irregularities that tainted the 2020 election results.\n \n\n   \n  Four of the 19 defendants in Willis’ case, including three attorneys directly involved in Trump’s bid to overturn the election results in the Peach State, accepted plea deals, in some cases pleading guilty to felony charges in exchange for more lenient sentencing recommendations.\n \n\n   \n  Thirty  “unindicted co-conspirators”  were also named in the high-profile case — a freight train that was barreling down the tracks simultaneously as Trump was campaigning for his second run at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Then in a  wild unexpected twist  in early 2024, Michael Roman, a campaign official for Trump in 2020, filed a motion that eventually got Willis disqualified from prosecuting the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help in the investigation. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, after Willis’ dramatic televised testimony put her personal life in the spotlight, Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee found that there was not enough evidence to firmly prove that Willis financially benefited from the relationship, and allowed Willis to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down, which he later did.\n \n\n   \n  However, the legal proceedings against Trump and several co-defendants were officially paused in June 2024 when a Georgia appeals court reviewed potential misconduct by Willis.\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, the appeals court officially disqualified Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Then the final dagger for Willis came in September, when  The Georgia Supreme Court declined  to hear an appeal from the Fulton County district attorney on  her removal .\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/science/mind-captioning-translate-visual-thoughts-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00-05:00","title":"Scientist turns people’s mental images into text using ‘mind-captioning’ technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Japanese scientist, Tomoyasu Horikawa, has developed a technology called 'mind-captioning' that uses brain scans and artificial intelligence to convert mental images into descriptive text.

‘mind-captioning’ technology \n       \n  By Amarachi Orie, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:48 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A scientist in  Japan  has developed a technique that uses brain scans and artificial intelligence to turn a person’s mental images into accurate, descriptive sentences.\n \n\n   \n  While there has been progress in using scans of brain activity to  translate the words we think  into text, turning our complex mental images into language has proved challenging, according to Tomoyasu Horikawa, author of a study published November 5 in the journal  Science Advances .\n \n\n   \n  However, Horikawa’s   new method, known as “mind-captioning,” works by using AI to generate descriptive text that mirrors information in the brain about visual details such as ob﻿jects, places, actions and events, as well as the relationships between them.\n \n\n   \n  Horikawa, a researcher at telecommunication company NTT’s Communication Science Laboratories just outside Tokyo, began by analyzing the brain acti﻿vity of four men and two women, native Japanese speakers between 22 and 37 years old, scanning their brains as they watched video clips. The participants viewed 2,180 videos without sound that were seconds long and varied in content among objects, scenes and actions.\n \n\n   \n  Large language models — generative AI systems trained on large datasets —   took   captions of the video clips and turned those captions into sequences of numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Horikawa trained separate, simpler AI models, known as “decoders,” to match the scanned brain activity related to the video clips to the numerical sequences.\n \n\n   \n  He then used   the decoders to interpret the study participants’ brain activity while   they watched or recalled videos that the AI had not encountered during the training process.   Another algorithm was created to progressively generate word sequences that best matched the decoded brain activity.\n \n\n   \n  As the AI learned from the data, the descriptive text tool   became better and better at using the brain scans to describe the videos the participants had watched.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just one additional step forward in the direction of what, in my view, we can legitimately call brain-reading or mind-reading,” Marcello Ienca, a professor of the ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich in Germany and president-elect of the International Neuroethics Society, told CNN. He was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n    Potential for ‘profound’ health interventions\n \n\n   \n  The AI model generated text in English, even though the participants were not native English speakers.\n \n\n   \n  The method can create comprehensive descriptions of visual content, even without using the activity in language-related regions of the brain, or the “language network,” Horikawa said, “indicating that this method can be used even when someone has damage around that language network.”\n \n\n   \n  The technology could potentially be used to assist people with aphasia, who struggle with language expression due to damage around the language network; or  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects speech, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this study paves the way for some profound interventions for people who have difficulty communicating, including non-verbal autistic people,” said psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, a lecturer at Barnard College in New York who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  However, “we have to use it carefully and make sure we aren’t being invasive and that everyone consents to it,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The ultimate privacy challenge’\n \n\n   \n  The success of this method — which could be applied to decode the thoughts of infants or animals, or the content of dreams — “raises ethical concerns” regarding privacy, with the possibility of disclosing an individual’s private thoughts before they have verbalized them, the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  If in the future this technology is used by consumers beyond biomedical purposes, “I think this is the ultimate privacy challenge,” Ienca said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that there are many companies, such as  Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant startup , that are making public claims about soon developing neural implants for the general population.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get there, then we need to have very, very strict rules when it comes to granting access to people’s minds and brains,” Ienca said, highlighting that our brains include “sensitive information” such as “signatures of early dementia and psychiatric disorders and depression.”\n \n\n   \n  A study published in the journal  Cell  in August suggested that the “leakage” of private inner thoughts during decoding could be prevented by a mechanism in which the user thinks of a particular keyword to unlock the decoding tool only when intended.\n \n\n   \n  The “neuroscience is moving fast and the assistive potential is huge — but mental privacy and freedom of thought protections can’t wait,” said social scientist Łukasz Szoszkiewicz, an assistant professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and a director of European Affairs at the Neurorights Foundation in New York.\n \n\n   \n  “We should treat neural data as sensitive by default, require explicit purpose-limited consent, and prioritize on-device processing with user-controlled ‘unlock’ mechanisms.

Liptak, Zachary Cohen, Jim Sciutto, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:43 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump was briefed this week on options for military operations inside Venezuela as he continues to mull a path forward in the country, four sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to decide on how to proceed, and he continues to weigh the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign. The president has previously voiced reservations about taking military action meant to oust Nicolas Maduro, concerned about whether it would prove effective.\n \n\n   \n  While Wednesday’s briefing included an updated set of options for the president to consider, it did not indicate that he’s closer to making a decision, one of the people said. Another source familiar with the briefing said the options were similar to those that have been discussed within the Pentagon, and some publicly reported, in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The target options – which United States Southern Command has stood up planning cells to develop – are part of an operation dubbed “SOUTHERN SPEAR,” according to a senior US official aware of the planning. They were presented by top officials on Trump’s national security team, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the operation on X Thursday night, though he did not reveal details.\n \n\n   \n  “Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Command had  previously announced  an operation called Operation Southern Spear in January. An announcement at the time said it would utilize “long-dwell robotic surface vessels, small robotic interceptor boats, and vertical take-off and landing robotic air vessels” to help with counternarcotics operations.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Southern Spear. The White House did not comment on the briefing. CBS News was first to report on the briefing.\n \n\n   \n   The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” arrived in the Caribbean this week amid a massive scale-up of US military resources.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including  air strikes  on military or government facilities and drug trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN had  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action at all. Administration officials told lawmakers last week that the US  didn’t have a legal justification  that would support attacks against any land targets – though it is possible they could generate one. And Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/china/shenzhou-20-crew-return-earth-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Chinese astronauts arrive home after suspected debris strike delays return to Earth","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three Chinese astronauts from the Shenzhou-20 mission returned to Earth after being delayed by more than a week due to a suspected debris strike that caused a crack in their return capsule.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday more than a week later than their scheduled arrival, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris strike left their spaceship with a cracked window.\n \n\n   \n  The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China’s Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they’d even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.\n \n\n   \n  But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).\n \n\n   \n  Medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  “The path of humanity’s exploration of space is not smooth,” Chen Dong, one of the astronauts, told journalists in front of the capsule. “It is full of difficulties and challenges, and that is also why we choose to walk this path.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very proud that we successfully completed the mission…We have finally made it home safely.”\n \n\n   \n  The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.\n \n\n   \n  The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China’s Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.\n \n\n   \n  Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a  nine-hour sortie , and it’s about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.\n \n\n   \n  The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.\n \n\n   \n  The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed  bans on Chinese citizens  with US visas participating in NASA programs.\n \n\n   \n  The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts who have been left in limbo. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, for example, spent 371 days on the ISS — a US record — after a tiny piece of space debris struck his Russian Soyuz spacecraft and forced a monthslong extension to his trip. Roscosmos launched a replacement capsule that eventually carried Rubio and cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams saw their weeklong stay on the International Space Station stretch into a more than nine-month mission after their spacecraft malfunctioned during a test flight. They joined the ISS expedition crew   and eventually  returned home  in March.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/walmart-ceo-doug-mcmillon-retire","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"09:53:00-05:00","title":"Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is stepping down","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO for over a decade, is stepping down in early 2026, to be succeeded by John Furner, who currently leads Walmart’s US operations.

year, the retailer announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  McMillon will be succeeded by John Furner on February 1, 2026. Furner is currently the CEO and president of Walmart’s US operations, the company’s largest business unit. Both executives have been with the company for several decades in various leadership roles.\n \n\n   \n  The transition comes amid a tumultuous time for retailers, as  tariffs  and sinking consumer sentiment has roiled the industry’s bottom lines. Yet  Walmart  under McMillon has overcome many of the issues that have plagued competitors – its supply-chain dominance and grocery prowess has allowed Walmart to offer rock-bottom prices on necessities, attracting customers across a wide range of income groups. The company reported in its most recent earnings call that its fastest-growing customer segment includes households who earn  more than $100,000 a year .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon also oversaw the company’s transition to a major ecommerce competitor, offering a strong alternative to Amazon and a significant growth engine for Walmart. The company has grown its Walmart+ subscription business that serves as a kind of nascent rival to Amazon Prime.\n \n\n   \n  He was also previously the  chairman  of Business Roundtable, the most prominent group of nearly 200 chief executives representing corporate America’s interests in Washington, for a two-year term.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to expanding Walmart, he’s also made striking changes at the company. In 2019, Walmart stopped selling handgun ammunition, ammunition commonly used in military-style assault weapons and ask customers to stop openly carrying guns at stores after a mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas location left  22 people dead .\n \n\n   \n  He was also an  outspoken  critic of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, and he has frequently spoken out against President Donald Trump’s  tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  But McMillon also oversaw the unsuccessful $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, an upmarket Amazon rival that didn’t pan out the way Walmart had expected. The business was ultimately shut down and integrated into the broader Walmart.com. McMillon’s push into upscale clothing, like Bonobos, also  hasn’t worked out .\n \n\n   \n  McMillon first began as a store associate and worked his way to top including stints at Sam’s Club and Walmart’s international operations. He helped harness Walmart ( WMT ) into being a true competitor to Amazon and its stock has grown 300% since he became CEO in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family and Board have stated many times that Doug was uniquely qualified to be CEO at the necessary time for Walmart,” said Greg Penner, Chairman of Walmart Inc., in a press release. “Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Furner, he’s been the CEO and President of Walmart US’ 4,600 stores since 2019 and also began as an hourly associate in 1993. In addition, he’s worked at Sam’s Club and Walmart China. The company credited his “associate development, digital innovation, and operational excellence.”\n \n\n   \n  Walmart said that McMillon remain on its board until next June and will be an adviser to Furner throughout fiscal year 2027. An announcement on Walmart’s US CEO replacement will be named soon.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/uk/king-charles-iii-77th-birthday-photo-intl-scli-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-04:00","title":"New photo released to mark King Charles III’s 77th birthday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On his 77th birthday, King Charles III was celebrated with a new photo from Sandringham Estate, where he is shown tending to a maple sapling, and a public event at Cyfarthfa Castle where he cut a cake and opened a new train depot.

with the release of a new photo of the monarch.\n \n\n   \n  The image, taken in May by photographer Millie Pilkington, shows  Charles  in the gardens of  Sandringham Estate  in Norfolk, with the sprawling stately home behind him.\n \n\n   \n   Other photos , seemingly taken at the same time, show him wandering Sandringham’s gardens and tending to a maple sapling. They were published in the magazine  Country Life  on Wednesday to mark Charles’ restoration of the historic gardens.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the King and Queen Camilla traveled to a reception at Cyfarthfa Castle, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of the Welsh capital, Cardiff, where he cut into an enormous birthday cake shaped like the castle.\n \n\n   \n  He later officially opened the South Wales Metro Train Depot, briefly sitting in the driver’s seat of one of the new tram-trains, and greeted members of the public who had waited outside in the rain for his arrival. Meanwhile in London, gun salutes were fired in Green Park and by Tower Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  The appearance of autumnal rain underscored why British monarchs often get two birthdays – one of which is “official” and marked by the Trooping the Colour parade.\n \n\n   \n  That takes place in the summer and sees 1,400 officers and soldiers parade through London on a crowd-lined route from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade.\n \n\n   \n  The tradition of the monarch enjoying  two birthdays  is thought to have started with King George II in 1748. Like Charles, he was also born in November.\n \n\n   \n  It has been a difficult few weeks for Charles. At the end of October, he took the extraordinary step to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles, in an attempt to quell the scandal over Andrew’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  That scandal overshadowed a historic moment earlier in October when Charles became the first British monarch to publicly pray with a pope in at least 500 years when he visited the Vatican and met Pope Leo XIV.\n \n\n   \n  Charles continues to balance his duties as monarch with ongoing cancer treatment, after he was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of the disease in early 2024.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/style/katseye-creative-director-humberto-leon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00+00:00","title":"Katseye: The New Global Girl Group Shaping Pop Culture Through Diversity and Authenticity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Katseye, a multiracial girl group formed from the Netflix reality show 'Pop Star Academy', represents a new model of global pop music that blends the K-pop structure with diverse cultural representation.

Humberto Leon is the mastermind behind their image \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:28 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two years ago, six young women — Sophia, Lara, Manon, Daniela, Megan and Yoonchae — went from relative obscurity to internet fame when the Netflix reality show, “Pop Star Academy,” turned them into the now-Grammy-nominated girl group Katseye.\n \n\n   \n  As their names were called out in the finale, the newly appointed members — who beat 120,000 other contestants vying for a spot — hugged and congratulated each other through sobs, each in matching gray blazer-skirt suits, styled with white shirts, knee-high socks and black shoes — mimicking the kind of attire worn by South Korean secondary students.\n \n\n   \n  The group is backed by Hybe Corporation, which brought K-pop to a global audience through mega artists like BTS, and Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record company and owner of Geffen Records. Together they sought to create the world’s first mainstream multiracial girl group modeled on  the traditional K-pop framework , which includes catchy melodies, synchronized dance moves and a strong emphasis on aesthetic appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Katseye’s members have   since stepped out in many head-turning looks, from the revealing red leather stage outfits worn in August for their Lollapalooza music festival performance, which drew record-breaking crowds, to the glitzy Dolce & Gabbana dresses worn for  their MTV VMAs red carpet debut  a month later. Earlier in the summer, they fronted  a viral campaign for Gap  while dancing   in low-rise denim to the 2003 Kelis song “Milkshake.” On other occasions, they’ve dipped into luxury brand archives and worn pieces from the likes of Prada, Hussein Chalayan and early 2000s Balenciaga designed by Nicolas Ghesquière. And as they embark on their first solo tour across North America — the tickets for which sold out in minutes — more eye-catching ensembles are sure to feature.\n \n\n   \n  The creative mastermind behind the band’s image is Humberto Leon, a former fashion entrepreneur and designer. Today, as Katseye’s creative director, Leon styles the members from head to toe, weighing in on every detail from the accessories to hair and makeup. In short, anything to do with their visual image falls under Leon’s purview.\n \n\n   \n  “There was this kind of feeling of tomboy meets rebellion,” Leon told CNN over a video call from Los Angeles, as he reflected on Katseye’s first appearance as a group. “The uniforms added a fun storytelling aspect.”\n \n\n   \n  School uniforms are a popular and recurring trope in pop culture (see a 16-year-old  Britney Spears in schoolgirl attire  in the music video for “Baby One More Time”). Several K-pop girl groups, including Girls’ Generation, Red Velvet and 2NE1, have also previously worn them, as they convey a youthful and fresh image. But Katseye’s look had subtle touches that pushed the common visual motif forward, according to Leon, whose subversive approach to fashion over a decades-long career has often appealed to hip audiences. “We wanted to differentiate,” he explained, “so all the jackets were actually boys’ blazers.”\n \n\n   \n    Bringing cultures together\n \n\n   \n  K-pop has gained significant mainstream traction over the years, but Katseye (which was trained using the K-pop methodology) is unlike many of the genre’s other bands. The group comprises multiple ethnicities: Sophia is from the Philippines; Yoonchae was born in South Korea; Manon was raised in Switzerland to Swiss-Italian and Ghanian parents; Daniela is Venezuelan-Cuban and Lara is of Indian descent, though both were born and raised in the US; and Megan is from Hawaii, born to a Singaporean-Chinese mother and Swedish-American father. Their songs are also sung almost entirely in English.\n \n\n   \n  Since Katseye’s official debut in 2024 with the EP “SIS (Soft is Strong)” and the viral breakthrough single “Touch,” which quickly landed on Spotify’s Top Hits playlist, the group has grown into one of pop’s most watched newcomers, adored for its diverse appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Leon shares a similarly multicultural upbringing. He currently resides in Eagle Rock, the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood where he was born and raised by a Peruvian father and Chinese mother, to whom he attributes his love of fashion. “My mom worked in a cafeteria by day, but in the evening, she would work on all these fun things, like selling cowboy hats to people, or in the ’80s she would sell fur coats at home, almost like the way people sell Tupperware,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She always encouraged me to be yourself and to clash, to not need things to be so perfect,” Leon added. “I took to heart a lot of that.”\n \n\n   \n  After working as a visual merchandiser for Gap and Burberry early in his career, Leon made his name in New York in the 2000s — he co-founded the now-shuttered Opening Ceremony (a once-cult shopping destination with stores in New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo) and was formerly co-designer at Kenzo, a role he jointly held with Carol Lim, with whom he revitalized the label by injecting a youthful, streetwise sensibility that appealed to shoppers.\n \n\n   \n  “Opening Ceremony was the antithesis of everything I had ever done,” said Leon. “It was about celebrating young designers and going around the world and finding these gems and bringing them to one place and creating almost this town square where people can discover stuff. Some people would buy, some didn’t — but for us, it didn’t matter. It was about creating a community where people can come together.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon is among a wave of fashion insiders who in recent years have made the shift to music and entertainment. Cynthia Oh, for instance, worked in high-end retail for more than two decades before becoming the visual creative director at Hybe and, now, The Black Label — K-pop super-producer Teddy Park’s company, which represents Blackpink’s Rosé among others.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve always celebrated this idea of bringing culture together,” Leon continued. “And so, in many ways, Katseye is just a different version of that.”\n \n\n   \n    A new kind of girl power\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s return to Eagle Rock and subsequent decision to launch the Peruvian-Chinese restaurant Chifa, in 2022, was spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. But it also led to his music industry crossover. “One day, this great punk rock girl group called  The Linda Lindas  came in. I was really inspired by them and said, ‘I would love to make a music video for you. Let’s do something fun.’” So, Leon worked with the band to create music videos for its 2022 album, “Growing Up,” which subsequently caught the eye of Hybe chairman Bang Si-hyuk and Interscope Geffen A&M chairman and CEO John Janick.\n \n\n   \n  “They approached me and asked if I would be interested in working on a global girl group,” said Leon. “The one thing I realized in all my other ventures I had done before is that there was this connection to storytelling and authenticity. When I was able to sum this up for myself, I felt like I could bring that same energy to other things,” he said. “The restaurant was the first thing that I started outside of fashion — yet a lot of people tell me it has a similar vibe to Opening Ceremony. It made me realize I was doing the right thing, and that I could bring this feeling to other cultures and artistic work.”\n \n\n   \n  Leon’s first interactions with Katseye involved “really getting to know them.” There have been “countless” girl groups, he said, rattling off a list of acts preceding them, such as the Spice Girls and Destiny’s Child, so it was crucial to figure out “the ideologies and virtues that these girls bring” and what made them   different. “The first thing I said to them was, ‘I want to hear about your background, how you grew up. I know you can dance, you can sing, but let’s hear about what you truly love and are inspired by,’ and with that, we were able to create a story that was genuine,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We talk a lot about silhouettes, we talk about designers, but it goes beyond that. We make sure that their culture is around and that each girl, as a whole, is represented,” Leon continued, noting the bindi worn by Lara as an example. (The bindi — a decorative mark or sticker worn on the forehead, most commonly by women in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions — is often sported by Lara, who has not disclosed her religion but has spoken publicly about using it to reclaim and represent   the   South Asian identity she was teased for as a child.)\n \n\n   \n  That emphasis on representation also extends to Katseye’s music. The band’s latest EP, “Beautiful Chaos,” released in June, marks a bolder chapter, with tracks like “Gnarly” and “M.I.A” highlighting each member’s vocal range and increasingly defined personal identities. “Gabriela,” the second single in the EP, is “very different to most of the other songs in that it has a femininity to it,” explained Leon. “Daniela sings the Spanish part of the song. It has this Latin vibe that we wanted to make sure that we capture.” What remains crucial, across both their songs and style, is “that there is synergy amongst each other,” Leon said.\n \n\n   \n  As Katseye’s tour begins, just weeks after the band’s first Grammy nomination, Leon is remaining tightlipped about his stage outfits. “We like to keep things as a surprise,” he teased, but noted that maintaining a sense of relatability and individuality have remained top priorities.\n \n\n   \n  For Leon, Katseye is the living embodiment of girl power for a Gen Z audience that is   “hungry for authenticity and genuine brands that stand for something, or a voice that they can relate to,” he said. But the group, Leon hopes, isn’t just for young girls, but fans of all genders and ages. “I want people to see themselves in Katseye,” he said. “I want them to be excited that a group like Katseye exists.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/cost-of-living-affordability-plan-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:51:00.000-05:00","title":"The affordability crisis is forcing Trump to radically reshape his economic plan on the fly","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is abandoning his original economic strategy due to public dissatisfaction with inflation, housing costs, and stagnant hiring.

But the realities of a persistent  affordability crisis , low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly.\n \n\n   \n  Although still in the early stages, Trump’s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items.\n \n\n   \n  Each tactic comes with significant question marks – and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans’ finances even more.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan A\n \n\n   \n  The original Trump economic plan was based on  three bold assumptions :\n \n\n   \n  For the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That’s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over.\n \n\n   \n  As it turns out, some parts didn’t work.\n \n\n   \n  Boosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven’t fallen – they’ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  High-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Bond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans has  doubled over the past four years , according to Fitch Ratings.\n \n\n   \n  It may be early to judge Trump’s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recent  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month’s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters’ minds when they went the polls.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Plan B\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new plan is emerging.\n \n\n   \n   Tariff dividends:  Trump last weekend floated the idea of  $2,000 tariff rebate checks , a proposal he’s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered.\n \n\n   \n  Using tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more,  exacerbating inflation .\n \n\n   \n   50-year mortgages:  Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a  50-year mortgage , which could lower homebuyers’ monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  But critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowers  never actually own their homes . Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump.\n \n\n   \n  All of that could harm Americans’ long-term financial security.\n \n\n   \n   Portable mortgages:  Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering a  portable mortgage , which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move – even as current mortgage rates remain high.\n \n\n   \n  But industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way.\n \n\n   \n   Lowering some tariffs:  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announce  lower tariffs on produce  that isn’t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n  That could reduce import prices, but it probably won’t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans’ fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won’t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures.\n \n\n   \n    Make America Affordable Again\n \n\n   \n  A significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump’s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the administration’s policies may be exacerbating the so-called  K-shaped economy , in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasingly  live paycheck to paycheck. \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s immediate reaction to the GOP’s election losses and new polls was denialism: He  claimed, falsely , that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN’s Alayna Treene  that Trump is getting more frequent economic briefings  and has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies.\n \n\n   \n  And Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: “Make America Affordable Again.” The devil, as always, will be in the details.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/media/bbc-apologizes-trump-documentary-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:53:00-05:00","title":"BBC Apologizes to Trump over Editing Blunder, Rejects Defamation Claim","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC apologized to US President Donald Trump over an editing error in a 2024 documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?', where a key segment of his January 6, 2021 speech was misrepresented by editing it to suggest he encouraged followers to 'fight like hell' at the Capitol—when the original statement was about cheering on lawmakers.

November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC apologized to US President Donald Trump on Thursday over a documentary that Trump’s lawyers described as false and defamatory, seeking to defuse a row that has plunged the public broadcaster into its  worst crisis in years .\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson said that lawyers for the broadcaster had written to Trump’s legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President (Donald) Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any BBC platforms while rejecting that it was defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s arguments as to why it believes it does not have a case to answer, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip not meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the October 2024 documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday. He is yet to respond to the BBC apology.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC had already apologized for an error of judgment in the documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, but not before it had ignited a scandal that saw the resignations of its director-general and head of news.\n \n\n   \n  In the documentary, Trump’s January 6 speech was edited to show him saying: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the US leader said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” with “fight like hell” coming 54 minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Trump said the British broadcaster had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday,  the Telegraph newspaper  accused the BBC of similarly editing the same speech in a 2022 episode of the show Newsnight, again making it look like Trump was encouraging his followers to “fight like hell” in the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the broadcaster said that “the BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards,” adding that the matter “has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has a history of sending legal threats and not following through with lawsuits. But he has sued  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  in recent months over other grievances.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s board has been criticized for responding too slowly to the editing error, which was revealed in a leaked internal memo that has created a firestorm of criticism and allegations of systemic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Deborah Turness, the outgoing CEO of BBC News who resigned on Sunday, has said that while mistakes were made, “allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to BBC News staff following her resignation, Turness said that the backlash surrounding the Trump documentary had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC that the broadcaster was “right to apologize for what were serious mistakes.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked if she believed the BBC is “doomed” if it loses the public’s trust, the official said that the organization “is and remains the most trusted source of news in this country, and one of the top five most trusted sources of news all over the world.”\n \n\n   \n  When it makes mistakes, the BBC must be “willing and able to respond to that level of challenge and to put in place changes, because that trust is something that is essential, it’s vital, it’s precious, and it must be protected,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The British public broadcaster’s next steps are not immediately clear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment when reached by CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/science/hitler-dna-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-05:00","title":"Researchers say they verified and sequenced Hitler’s DNA.

King said she verified that a piece of material taken from a couch in the bunker where Hitler shot himself in 1945 was soaked in the dictator’s blood by comparing a DNA sample recovered from the blood with a confirmed relative of Hitler’s.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to suggesting the possibility that Hitler had a hormone-disrupting congenital condition called  Kallmann syndrome , the documentary examined rumors that the dictator had Jewish ancestry and looked at whether he had a genetic predisposition to certain mental health conditions. Called “Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,” the documentary premieres Saturday on Channel 4 in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  However, the findings shared in the documentary haven’t been reviewed by other scientists in the field or published in a scientific journal, making it hard for experts not involved in the project to evaluate the validity of its assertions. King said that the analysis had been submitted to a “high-profile” journal and said she hopes the work will be published soon.\n \n\n   \n  The small patch of frayed fabric started its journey in 1945 in the hands of US Army Col. Roswell P. Rosengren, who was communications officer for Gen. Dwight D Eisenhower. When Rosengren was allowed into Hitler’s bunker by Soviet forces, he cut a swatch of material from a bloodstained couch, according to the documentary. The swatch stayed in Rosengren’s family before being put up for sale at auction in 2014 and purchased by the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t know what we were going to find,” King said. “It could have been the most boring genome on the planet, but it has been incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The most striking finding from the team’s analysis was that Hitler had a mutation on a gene called PROK2. Variants in this gene  are a cause of Kallmann syndrome  and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, King  said. In boys, these conditions   can delay puberty and cause undescended testicles.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically, they are characterized by low testosterone levels. You either don’t go through puberty or you go through a partial puberty … 5% of cases get associated with a  micropenis , ”    King said, referring to a small but normally structured penis.\n \n\n   \n    Clues in the historical record\n \n\n   \n  At the time of his death, Hitler was observed at the end of the sofa with a gun and blood splattered on the couch and the wall behind him, said Nicholas F. Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist with the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History. He examined parts of the sofa, which is now in Russia, in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  “If the provenance of the sofa material used is confirmed to have come from the Bunker and from the settee that Hitler and  Eva Braun  died on, then the likelihood of the blood having come from Hitler is very good,” Bellantoni said by email.\n \n\n   \n  The new details that King put forth appear to align with the historical record, according to Alex Kay, an expert on Nazi Germany and senior lecturer at the Chair of War Studies at Germany’s University of Potsdam. Kay also appeared in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that a medical document from Hitler’s stay in prison after a failed coup known as the Munich  beer hall putsch  in 1923 suggested the dictator had right-side cryptorchidism — a condition in which a testicle fails to descend into the scrotum.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of Kallmann syndrome is, for me, personally, as a historian and as somebody who has spent more than 20 years researching the Nazis, a major finding,” Kay said. He added the information potentially explained Hitler’s lack of personal relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Kay and King said the findings also put to rest lingering rumors that Hitler had Jewish ancestry — speculation that stemmed from Hitler’s grandmother becoming pregnant while working in a Jewish household, according to the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Because the Y chromosome data analyzed in the research matched the DNA of Hitler’s male line relative, King said it’s not possible Hitler had Jewish ancestry. “If that was the case, we wouldn’t have got the DNA match with him,” King said. “That DNA match not only confirmed that this is Hitler’s DNA but also confirms that that story of human Jewish ancestry through his father is just simply not true.”\n \n\n   \n    The value of historical DNA\n \n\n   \n  King said she had some initial reservations about taking part in the documentary but decided to participate because she felt her expertise would   ensure that the analysis was scientifically rigorous. “This is also not just a documentary but an academic paper,” she said, adding she had no publication date to offer.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have previously used DNA to study well-known historical figures. Beethoven’s DNA, recovered from a lock of hair, revealed that the  composer had health issues . Archaeologists also widely use ancient DNA from human remains.\n \n\n   \n  However, without information on the quality of the genome, the raw data or how the analyses were done, it is not possible to assess the assertions made in the documentary, according to Pontus Skoglund, senior group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n \n\n   \n  “Stepping back, the scientific value of a media campaign such as this balanced against the possible stigmatization of individuals with these real diseases today can also be questioned,” Skoglund said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the researchers could have shared the findings with the scientific community on what’s known as a preprint server before a formal peer review and publication in an established journal.\n \n\n   \n  It’s plausible that historical DNA could be extracted from the piece of cloth, but there has to be good justification for studying the DNA from historical figures and a defined set of questions, said Tom Booth, Skoglund’s colleague and a bioarchaeologist at the Francis Crick Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “There are extensive historical records documenting the behaviour of Hitler in public and private,” Booth said via email. “(H)e is probably one of the most intensively studied figures in history, so I think it’s difficult to argue the DNA evidence adds much in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  “Even the Kallmann syndrome diagnosis might not be as straightforward as the headlines suggest. There can be a lot of variation in how it manifests physically, and while it is a plausible explanation for his undescended testicle, it doesn’t justify the amount of ‘micropenis’ in my newsfeed.” \n \n\n   \n    A ‘small, small puzzle piece’\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also said they calculated a polygenic risk score, which involves sifting through a person’s DNA to quantify disease risk. Their findings suggested that Hitler had an increased genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.\n \n\n   \n  However, polygenic risk score is a tool used today for research purposes — it’s not diagnostic and doesn’t mean that Hitler necessarily had these conditions, said Ditte Demontis, a professor in psychiatric genetics at Denmark’s Aarhus University, who was involved in the research and appears in the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  “Currently, we are at a state where polygenic risk scores for psychiatric conditions are only used in the context of research,” Demontis emphasized. “We can say something at a group level but not an individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Demontis compared Hitler’s polygenic risk score with those of 30,000 Danish people and found that if Hitler lived today “his score for schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder was actually higher than 99% of the individuals in the Danish population.” It is also rare to have a high polygenic risk score for all three conditions, she added.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not diagnostic, and I also want to stress that the score absolutely by no means leads to any certain kinds of behavior or actions,” Demontis said.\n \n\n   \n  King agreed. “We are at great, great pain not to stigmatize people with these conditions, because, you know … it’s incredibly rare that   people with these conditions go on to commit violent acts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And the other thing is that Hitler did not act alone, he had hundreds and thousands of people who helped him,” King noted. “They’re not all going to have the same genetic makeup as him. His genetics is just a small, small puzzle piece.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/republicans-scramble-health-care-obamacare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Republicans scramble for health care plan, as Democrats eye midterm battle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expire in weeks, leading to a sharp rise in health insurance premiums, Republicans are under intense pressure to develop a new health care plan.

November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans in Washington successfully  defused the 43-day government shutdown  without surrendering to Democrats’ demands to spend billions more to offset spiking health insurance costs.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the GOP is under mounting pressure to figure out its own plan.\n \n\n   \n  Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire in just weeks – which would  more than double  the cost of premiums nationally for tens of millions of Americans. And it’s causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the White House, officials are accelerating efforts to put together a new health care plan that fulfills  President Donald Trump ’s desire to take another shot at overhauling Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  Those early discussions have sought to balance Trump’s demands against the broader Republican Party’s wariness of waging another politically disastrous health care war, four people familiar with the matter said. Officials are debating a limited package of conservative health care changes, including eliminating the enhanced ACA subsidies in favor of funneling money directly to Americans — potentially through an expansion of health savings accounts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, are closely watching the GOP’s plans, which they believe will never pass Congress – giving them a huge political boost and possibly delivering them control of the House in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of the GOP’s plans is fueling anxiety for Republicans like Rep. Jeff Van Drew, the outspoken populist from New Jersey who has repeatedly urged party leaders to give some relief for those Obamacare premiums or face voters’ wrath next November.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a whole bunch [of ideas] that are out there,” Van Drew said, ticking off proposals such as Trump’s idea to give money directly to consumers to buy plans. “The question is, can we get them done on time, to really not hurt people in the United States of America?”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another reason Van Drew is worrying. Time is running short and he said GOP leaders have been tight-lipped on their plans: “A lot of members haven’t seen any of this.”\n \n\n   \n  He isn’t the only one sounding the alarm. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — who has drawn the ire of Trump himself for her criticism of the party — has been repeatedly warning of a health care catastrophe of the GOP’s own making if Congress doesn’t act.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s my problem. Republicans have never fixed it,” Greene said of Obamacare in an interview with “The Sean Spicer Show.” She said Republicans need to act to make sure “the American people aren’t driving 80 miles per hour off a brick wall and hitting a financial crisis which is what’s actually happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the GOP’s leadership ranks,  there’s an acknowledgement  they need to do something on health care affordability. But those party leaders are also staunchly opposed to renewing those subsidies, which they insist simply funds insurance companies and props up a failed law.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, House GOP leaders are assembling their own slate of health care bills — though exactly which ones have yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pulling together the best ideas that we can, in the quickest fashion, to bring premiums down,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Wednesday night, the same day the House returned from a six-week recess during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  White House aides have similarly indicated that they will soon have a concrete plan, insisting that the administration plans to play a central role in directing the GOP’s health care strategy amid deepening concerns over Trump’s standing on the economy and affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to further expanding health savings accounts, officials have weighed a range of existing conservative policy ideas aimed at expanding patients’ health care options and lowering costs — including loosening certain Obamacare guardrails and giving states greater flexibility to customize their health insurance marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Yet many of those proposals have proven unpopular with voters in the past, and fall well short of Trump’s vow to “forget this Obamacare madness” altogether. And as the midterm outlook worsens for the GOP, some in the party still plan to push for a simpler compromise on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  There are at least a dozen House Republicans who do support temporarily extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies, many of them from battleground districts that will be key to GOP control of the chamber next year. Virginia Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans has been particularly vocal on the issue, drafting a bill to extend the subsidies for one year that’s gotten a dozen GOP cosponsors.\n \n\n   \n  Kiggans and her cosponsors are already working to plot a path forward: Staff of several of those members on the bill will meet Thursday to discuss next steps, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Another swing-seat Republican backing the bill, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Senate leaders Thursday seeking bipartisan talks to work on a bill extending those Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But even some House moderates privately acknowledge that it’s unlikely any provision that upholds Obamacare can pass the GOP chamber. Even if the bill would win Democratic votes, GOP leaders know there is fierce resistance to any Obamacare bill and would refuse to put it on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also grown increasingly opposed to continuing the subsidies despite the political peril, with one of the people familiar with the matter characterizing the president as “on fire” over the issue. Though administration officials during the shutdown’s first weeks had weighed supporting a short-term extension that would phase out the subsidies over time, that idea has since appeared to lose steam, the people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump in recent days has instead repeatedly disparaged the tax credits as a “disaster” and latched onto arguments made by conservative allies that they largely amount to a windfall for insurance companies.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jim Jordan, the influential House Judiciary chairman, for instance, entirely dismissed the idea of extending the subsidies when pressed by CNN if he could accept any plan that kept them in place.\n \n\n   \n  “If Obamacare was so wonderful, why do we need to keep extending the expanded subsidies?” the Ohio Republican said. ”This is an expansion of Obamacare.”\n \n\n   \n  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, too, argued that any extension of the subsidies would be simply a move to “prop up a failed Obamacare fund.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Affordable Care Act has failed miserably at being affordable. That is a broken model. We want to give people options that lower their premiums, not just shovel more money to insurance companies,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-decision-nears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Clock is ticking ahead of NCAA’s decision on proposed gambling rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As sports gambling expands across the U.S., the NCAA faces mounting pressure to update its longstanding ban on college athletes and staff betting on professional sports.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.\n \n\n   \n  But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense.\n \n\n   \n  Betting on college sports will remain a no-no.\n \n\n   \n  “This change recognizes the realities of today’s sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,’’ Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement.\n \n\n   \n  The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach.\n \n\n   \n  The timing created immediate blowback at the NCAA’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey wrote to NCAA president Charlie Baker, urging him to reconsider.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association’s commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,’’ Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process.\n \n\n   \n  It is worth noting that, of the 20 cabinet members who voted, and despite their commissioner’s protests, the two representing the SEC - Jeremiah Donati, the athletic director at South Carolina, and Matt Boyer, the SEC’s assistant commissioner for compliance - both voted in favor of the proposal per the NCAA committee’s report.\n \n\n   \n  Of the eight people representing the four power conferences (each of whose votes is weighted: 2.75 versus 1), both ACC representatives voted against the initial proposal, the Big Ten and SEC voted in favor, and the Big 12 split its vote.\n \n\n   \n  In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General’s office  announced  14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/immigration-california-revokes-commercial-drivers-licenses-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:33:00-04:00","title":"California revokes 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses for immigrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California is revoking 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants after discovering that the licenses expired after the drivers lost legal status in the U.S. The action follows criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who claims California violated state law and improperly issued licenses.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the  drivers were legally allowed  to be in the US, state officials said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public’s consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the US made an illegal U-turn and caused a  crash in Florid a that killed three people.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California’s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver’s licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we’ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,” Duffy said, referring to the state’s governor. “This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person’s legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Newsom’s spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver’s licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed.\n \n\n   \n  The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy revoked $40 million in  federal funding  because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state’s effort to comply.\n \n\n   \n  The new rules for commercial driver’s licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa.\n \n\n   \n  H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a US business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n \n\n   \n  Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn’t have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver’s work permit expired — sometimes years after.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom’s office said the state followed guidance it received from the US Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/eric-swalwell-mortgage-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-05:00","title":"Bill Pulte refers Rep.

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by January 30, 2026 in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2025 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/health/glp-1-hair-loss-telogen-effluvium-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Why some people lose their hair when they’re on GLP-1s","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses growing reports of hair loss among individuals using GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound.

    \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.\n \n\n   \n  “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”\n \n\n   \n  A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,   diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.\n \n\n   \n  The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.\n \n\n   \n    What is telogen effluvium?\n \n\n   \n  There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.\n \n\n   \n  “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”\n \n\n   \n  When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.\n \n\n   \n  Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.\n \n\n   \n    Malnutrition may play a role\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.\n \n\n   \n  Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”   \n \n\n   \n  Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”\n \n\n   \n    Other theories\n \n\n   \n  There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.\n \n\n   \n  Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”\n \n\n   \n  Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.\n \n\n   \n  Nusbaum points to a  study  in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.\n \n\n   \n  “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.\n \n\n   \n  “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”\n \n\n   \n  A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.\n \n\n   \n  “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”\n \n\n   \n    Treatments for hair loss\n \n\n   \n  Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.\n \n\n   \n  Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.\n \n\n   \n  However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”\n \n\n   \n  That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.\n \n\n   \n  “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth. In androgenetic alopecia, we’re looking at more long-term therapies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.\n \n\n   \n  “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”\n \n\n   \n  Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/oklahoma-gas-leak-ammonia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:16:00-05:00","title":"Ammonia Gas Leak from Tanker Truck in Oklahoma Sickens Dozens and Forces Evacuations","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An anhydrous ammonia leak from a tanker truck parked behind a Holiday Inn Express in Weatherford, Oklahoma, sickened dozens and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate.

dangerous ammonia gas outside a hotel overnight, filling its hallways with fumes and forcing hundreds of nearby residents of a small Oklahoma city to evacuate, authorities said Thursday. Several dozen people were treated at hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  Officials lifted a shelter-in-place order Thursday morning, hours after firefighters wearing gas masks went door to door in Weatherford, waking people up and telling them to leave because of the anhydrous ammonia leak.\n \n\n   \n  An oil field worker staying at the hotel where the truck had been parked said he heard a “faint pop” Wednesday night and noticed a smell minutes later. He and a coworker left their room and hustled into a hallway and then an elevator filling up with a pungent odor.\n \n\n   \n  Once outside, they saw their vehicles underneath a cloud of ammonia, said Michael Johnson, of Nacogdoches, Texas. “The smell itself punched me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He took off running, but noticed his roommate wasn’t with him and saw that he had run for their trucks. He said a police officer managed to save his coworker.\n \n\n   \n  “His lips were purple and frozen shut,” Johnson said. “His eyes were bloodshot red. His skin was all red.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson found one person stumbling and gave him a shirt to put over his mouth. At one point, he looked at the smoke and saw they were surrounded, thinking “We’re going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  Police said 34 people were treated at a local hospital and 11 patients were taken to Oklahoma City area hospitals. Several victims remained in intensive care late Thursday, but the majority were in stable condition, police said in a statement. Dozens more received treatment at casualty centers.\n \n\n   \n  Five responding officers sustained chemical burns to their airways, police said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 500 to 600 people went to a shelter early Thursday while others were ordered to remain inside their homes for several hours. Some nursing homes were evacuated, and schools were closed for the day.\n \n\n   \n  A leaking gasket from a tanker truck carrying 25,000 pounds of ammonia was responsible, the EPA said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating.\n \n\n   \n  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a farm fertilizer to help corn and wheat grow. The colorless gas has a suffocating odor and can be deadly, especially at high concentrations, or cause breathing problems and burns to the skin and eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Just last week, an anhydrous ammonia leak forced evacuations near Yazoo City, Mississippi, and two years ago,  five people died  in Illinois when a tanker truck spilled anhydrous ammonia after it was forced off a road by a passing minivan.\n \n\n   \n  The cleanup in Weatherford — a city of 12,000 people about 70 miles west of Oklahoma City — could take several days, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  “We pretty much got a lot of this stuff diluted right now,” Orefice said, adding that authorities were working with environmental officials.\n \n\n   \n  The EPA said subsequent air monitoring did not detect any ammonia in the local residential area. The levels of pH in the local creek were within normal and the levels detected in the soil were expected to “naturally neutralize over a short period.”\n \n\n   \n  The driver of the truck carrying the gas had parked behind a Holiday Inn Express to get a room there for the evening, Orefice said. The cause seemed to be a mechanical failure on a valve or a faulty seal, the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said the air quality was being monitored and that the tanker truck was no longer leaking. A number of agencies were assisting, including hazmat crews and the Oklahoma National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Trisha Doucet called police for help when she learned the leak was blocks away from where her mother was caring for her bed-bound 89-year-old grandmother. An ambulance was quickly dispatched to get her to safety.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandmother, who is on hospice, was reluctant to leave. “But this is my house,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Doucet, who used to work as an EMT and knew the dangers of anhydrous ammonia, recalled telling her grandmother, “That’s the hardest part.

12:23 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Two months after 300 South Korean nationals were detained and left the US following in an  immigration raid  at Hyundai’s electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia, some of those workers have returned to America to resume those jobs, their employer said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The September raid shut down work on a battery plant under construction at the sprawling site near Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group began producing electric vehicles last year.\n \n\n   \n   Most of the 475 workers detained  were South Korean nationals. US immigration officials said they entered the US with visas that had expired or with visa waivers that prohibited them from working.\n \n\n   \n  The battery plant’s operator, HL-GA Battery Co., said in a statement Thursday that construction has resumed with a mix of new and returning workers. The company thanked the US and South Korean governments, as well as Georgia officials, “for their collaboration in supporting a smooth and timely return.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain on track to start production in the first half of next year and continue to actively hire local positions to operate the facility,” the battery company’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  An HL-GA Battery spokesperson, Mary Beth Kennedy, confirmed to The Associated Press that some of the returning workers were among the South Korean nationals detained in September. Kennedy said she did not know how many.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 South Korean workers were detained in an immigration raid September 4 at the sprawling site where the Hyundai Motor Group produces electric vehicles near Savannah. The workers spent a week at a Georgia detention center before the South Korean government negotiated their release and flew them home.\n \n\n   \n  The roundup by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which released video showing some of the detained workers shackled in chains, sparked  outrage and feelings of betrayal  in South Korea, a key US ally that has pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in American investments.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia raid targeted one of the state’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where  Hyundai produces  electric vehicles at a $7.6 billion plant. The 475 people detained all worked at the battery plant, which will produce batteries to power Hyundai EVs. It is operated by HL-GA Battery, a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution.\n \n\n   \n  The South Korean nationals detained in Georgia were largely engineers and other highly skilled workers who came to the US temporarily to install equipment and perform other specialized work to get the battery plant up and running.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many of the formerly detained workers are coming back. Jongwon Lee, an attorney in metro Atlanta, said he has firsthand knowledge of two Korean nationals who plan to return after the US State Department confirmed that their B-1 business visitor visas were still valid.\n \n\n   \n  But Kihwan Kim, president of the Federation of Korean Associations for the Southeast US, said some of the workers snared in the raid are hesitant to return to the US.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t have to come to the United States to work after that kind of humiliation,” Kim said. “They can go to other countries.”\n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s government demanded improvements to the US visa system for skilled Korean workers. Last month, the South Korean Foreign Ministry announced that US officials had agreed to allow South Korean workers on short-term visas or a visa waiver program to help build industrial sites in America\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump initially defended the  immigration raid  in Georgia, saying in September that the detained workers “were here illegally, ” When asked about those workers again during an October visit to Seoul, Trump said: “I was  opposed  to getting them out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/air-travel-impact-government-reopening","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Government Reopening Paves Way for Air Travel Recovery, But Challenges Remain","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government reopened after a prolonged shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, ending the longest in history.

What’s that mean for air travel? \n       \n  By Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  People flying home for Thanksgiving this month have their list of things to be thankful for: the turkey, football, time with family. This year, they can also   add  H.R. 5371   to the list.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the funding bill President Donald Trump signed into law on Wednesday to reopen the government,  ending  the longest government shutdown in US history.\n \n\n   \n  The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after  cuts mandated  by the Federal Aviation Administration led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings”  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But before they get to say grace with family, travelers are now praying Bastian’s assessment is right, even as many questions remain about how quickly air traffic controller staffing will stabilize and when Transportation Security Administration workers will   get paid.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what we know about the plans to get more planes back up in the skies – and the uncertainty that remains.\n \n\n   \n    When will airlines stop canceling flights?\n \n\n   \n  The morning after the federal government reopened, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was filled with travelers keeping the hectic pace typical of the world’s busiest airport. But a closer look revealed something new: a palpable sense of relief in travelers.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that it will get back to some kind of normalcy or just a little bit better before the holidays,” Metreia White said, before boarding a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Hartsfield-Jackson is one of 40 major airports where airlines are still under  orders  from the FAA to cut   6% of their flights, many on shorter   regional routes . Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the cancellations have been necessary for safety because of air traffic controller staffing shortages during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Fridays and Saturdays have seen the most staffing problems throughout this time, according to data viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers missed  two paychecks  since   the shutdown started on  October 1 , and some are taking second jobs to make ends meet or calling in sick in protest.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been data-based,” Duffy said, citing examples of airplane mishaps at a  news conference  at Chicago O’Hare International Airport. “We’ve seen heightened complaints by pilots of the communication they’re having with air traffic controllers.”\n \n\n   \n  But “staffing levels …  improved dramatically ” when it became clear that a funding deal was coming, Bastian said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think our   air traffic controllers are seeing an end to the shutdown, and feel more hopeful, and they are coming in,” Duffy said on Tuesday. The  Department of Transportation  stopped short of the planned 10% cuts because more air traffic controllers started showing up at work.\n \n\n   \n  They will remain frozen at 6% until the FAA determines it is safe to resume more flights.\n \n\n   \n  Logistics can also impact flight schedules, according to Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines.\n \n\n   \n  “Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote — there will be residual effects for days,” the group’s president and CEO, Chris Sununu, said in a  statement  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Canceling one flight has a domino effect. They’ve had to move different airplanes in untraditional ways,” Sununu added at a news conference on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the challenges, airlines expect to rally quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said in a  statement  Wednesday that it expects to be “back to full capacity over the next few days.”\n \n\n   \n  Southwest  said  on Wednesday they’re “seeing real progress, and air travel appears to be returning to normal. Our operation remains strong, and Customers can continue to count on Southwest.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines leaders told  employees  in a letter Thursday that they are optimistic about minimizing cancellations in time for the holiday.\n \n\n   \n  “It may take a few days for fully normal controller operations to resume, and we may need to continue to reduce schedules to comply with the FAA’s emergency order requirements,” wrote CEO Robert Ison and Chief Operating Officer David Seymour. “But we have seen promising signs and are confident that because of our strategic planning and work to minimize customer impacts throughout this period, we will recover quickly and deliver a strong Thanksgiving operation.”\n \n\n   \n    When do air traffic controllers get paid?\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday her team finished up the administrative work necessary “ late last night ” so TSA employees could receive back pay for paychecks missed during the government shutdown as soon as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve already missed pay periods and recognizing that that’s a hardship on their families,” Noem  said . “So we did all of the administrative work that we needed to late last night to ensure that payroll would be processed as soon as possible, and within the next coming days, they will get that into their bank accounts.”\n \n\n   \n  A DHS spokesperson told CNN the agency “will be working to expedite pay for all employees who were furloughed or working without pay in an excepted status.”\n \n\n   \n  Noem also announced some TSA employees who “stepped up every single day” and “served with exemplary service” through the federal government shutdown would receive a  $10,000 bonus check .\n \n\n   \n  “They were all examples of what we need and we will be continuing to not only recognize employees across the country, but we will be looking at every single TSA official that helped serve during this government shutdown and do what we can to recognize that and help them financially with a bonus check to get them and their family back on their feet,” the secretary said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Duffy  said  that air traffic controllers were expected to get 70% of their back pay “anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after the government opens,” with the remainder to come a week later.\n \n\n   \n  Technicians who work on air traffic control equipment are also awaiting their back pay, said David Spero, national president of their union, PASS National.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is going to take time,” said Spero. “We’re going to have people with ongoing pay issues for a while.”\n \n\n   \n  He also said the technicians who continued to maintain air traffic control equipment through the shutdown deserve recognition, too.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m looking into it and reaching out to FAA leadership now,” Spero said Thursday. “Not one delay in the last 43 days has been attributed to a system outage or an equipment problem.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the long-term impacts on travel?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have acknowledged losing millions of dollars of revenue from the canceled flights, and industry leaders said travelers were getting wary of putting money down on a trip that might not happen.\n \n\n   \n  “The consumer is pulling back,” said Sununu. “Typically, airlines and hotels can be a leading indicator of where folks are spending their money in the economy.”\n \n\n   \n  US  domestic flights  are expected to cost 6% more over Thanksgiving week this year compared to last and rise 7% during the year-end holiday period, according to discount air travel site  Going.com , but it’s not clear how those prices were affected by the flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  One bit of ironic luck for both airlines and passengers in the midst of this misfortune, according to the Delta CEO, is that all major carriers were   equally impacted, so the financial loss shouldn’t result in higher ticket prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a competitive marketplace,” said Bastian. “Everyone went through the same thing.”\n \n\n   \n  The airline industry says in the future, the government should guarantee the stability of the air travel system, even in a shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The FAA’s  Airport and Airway Trust Fund  currently has $5 billion that could be used to pay air traffic controllers during future shutdowns,” Airlines for America said in a  statement . “We ask Congress to consider legislation that would implement a long-term solution.”\n \n\n   \n  There are other impacts too, that won’t be solved by the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what’s needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit,  Duffy told reporters this week , while some older controllers chose to simply retire.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.\n \n\n   \n    Could this happen again in January?\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through  January .\n \n\n   \n  That means that airlines and passengers may be grounded again in three months.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no back to normal in this deal because all it does is kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there’s another storm on the horizon.”\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, said it takes time to rebuild – both operations and morale – after disruptions like this to the travel industry.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot afford another self-inflicted crisis that threatens the systems millions rely on every day,” said Freeman.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Pete Muntean, Tami Luhby, Chris Boyette and Amanda Musa contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/entertainment/james-van-de-beek-auction","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"11:16:00-05:00","title":"James Van Der Beek auctioning off ‘Dawson’s Creek’ and ‘Varsity Blues’ memorabilia amid life’s ‘twists and turns’","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Van Der Beek is auctioning off iconic memorabilia from his roles in the 1998–2003 TV series 'Dawson’s Creek' and the 1999 film 'Varsity Blues,' including a prom necklace from the show and film-worn cleats and a West Canaan Coyotes hat.

Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Deep below the US Capitol, in a secure room meant to protect discussions of American secrets, a wave of sarcastic laughter spread among lawmakers and staff members who were assembled to receive a briefing in late October from senior Pentagon officials.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy rear admiral and a top civilian adviser to the defense secretary had made the trip to Capitol Hill to walk lawmakers through an accelerating string of strikes that to date have  now claimed 80 lives . The attacks were part of a campaign the Trump administration says is aimed at disrupting the operations of drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  But in a meeting the lawmakers expected would center around growing concerns over whether the military had the legal right to kill traffickers without knowing their identities and without trial, the two Pentagon briefers had left something behind: the military lawyers who had been scheduled to attend.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of the sudden cancellation by the lawyers was immediately seen by some of the lawmakers as a classic stonewalling tactic – with no lawyers around, the Pentagon officials could claim ignorance on legal questions – triggering the wry laughs in the secure room.\n \n\n   \n  But what the Pentagon officials did have to say that day struck several attendees as deeply troubling. It was the way briefers described those killed in the operations – so-called enemy combatants – that seemed to provide evidence that the administration was dusting off the playbook of the drone war in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The briefers discussed the strikes against alleged drug boats in nearly identical terms as those carried out in the Middle East during the global war on terror: Killed in Action, target signature, enemy combatants.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, wait a minute, enemy KIA, what war are we talking about here? What declared conflict am I missing?” one source familiar with the briefing told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In that and other briefings with lawmakers, military officials have acknowledged they didn’t know the names of those killed, the exact destination of their vehicles or have the documentation to prosecute them for their alleged crimes. But the targets’ actions fit the intelligence of what the briefers referred to as “terrorist” activity and so they were labeled as “enemy KIA,” or killed in action, a phrase used for decades to represent troops perishing on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  The US spent more than a decade carrying out attacks, known as “signature strikes,” based on similar rough intelligence profiles as part of its drone campaign in the Middle East. But that campaign occurred during a period when US troops were routinely coming under enemy fire and were facing regular roadside bombings.\n \n\n   \n  US forces operating in and around Latin America have not reported taking fire, and the Pentagon has said no troops have been injured during its recent operations in the region. Nonetheless, the US military has conducted 20 strikes, destroying 21 boats while labeling those killed “narco-terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been explicit in drawing the comparison between terrorist groups and drug trafficking operations in Latin America, calling them the “Al-Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere.”\n \n\n   \n  “My advice to foreign terrorist organizations, do not get in a boat,” Hegseth said during a recent speech.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes against boats have used drones designed to carry hellfire missiles, the same combination of hardware that had been the backbone of the signature strike campaign in the Middle East, though CNN has reported that AC-130J gunships have also participated in some of the attacks in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  US officials have told Congress they do not need to identify individual targets before killing them – mirroring an argument made by past administrations to justify similar strikes against terror networks.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that a signature is misinterpreted or erroneous and an innocent party is attacked,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and a senior adviser with the CSIS Defense and Security Department.\n \n\n   \n  He described how signature strikes in the Middle East used traits of a target, and how that same logic could be applied to drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Caribbean, that means that if a vessel exhibits characteristics a, b, and c, then it is presumed to be running drugs,” he said, though he added, “It’s possible that the administration has more direct information and is not releasing that to avoid compromising sources and methods.”\n \n\n   \n  But unlike during the war on terror, the Trump administration lacks Congressional authorization for a sustained military campaign against alleged drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of an opinion produced by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers, a distinction with a very clear difference compared to terror groups that have been targeted in similar strikes.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Trump administration lawyers appear to be relying heavily on the President’s broad Article II authority – the section of the Constitution that outlines the role of the president including their command of the military.\n \n\n   \n  Taken together, the Trump administration is testing the bounds of its authority to wage war abroad – fueling concerns among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who continue to question the president’s legal justification for the strikes. It has also raised questions as to what lessons the administration and military may or may not have learned from the decadeslong conflict in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not reply to a request for comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  “How many briefings have I sat in at this point, where there’s some general or admiral sitting there and giving me vignettes about operations, and talking about the number of people they kill, enemy combatants they kill, their boats they blowing up, or tanks they’re blowing up, and how the mission was a success, and none of them could actually tell me what the strategy and endgame was and how they were going to measure success,” Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “And, so this is no different. I mean, they have learned nothing from our last 25 years, it seems,” Crow, who also served three tours in Iraq in Afghanistan and was an Army Ranger, added.\n \n\n   \n    Expansion of strikes\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s broader plan for the counter-drug campaign has not been articulated publicly, top officials have made clear that they intend to continue targeting smugglers using a similar playbook to the one used for killing terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  In practice, current and former US national security officials told CNN the two missions are not so different.\n \n\n   \n  “Network targeting is network targeting,” said one former US intelligence official with knowledge of the administration’s current strategy focused on dismantling drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, the “end state complicates things,” the former official added.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes against alleged drug boats started September 2, announced by President Donald Trump in a post on social media claiming that the boat was being operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. That first strike killed 11, Trump wrote, as he claimed that the gang was being directed by Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That was a theme in the early wave of strikes, as the Trump administration tried to tie Maduro to drug trafficking – namely fentanyl – while attacking boats near the Venezuelan coast in the Caribbean. It coincided with a massive buildup of military assets in the Caribbean, which now includes the Ford Carrier Strike Group and has raised questions about  whether the US intends to strike inside Venezuela  and potentially try to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  While those tensions continue to simmer, the boat strike campaign began to expand to the Pacific Ocean in late October, shifting focus from fentanyl to stopping the movement of cocaine. The announced targets also got less specific. Nearly all of the subsequent strikes including that first in the Pacific were against a “designated terrorist organization,” as announced by Hegseth, mirroring Global War on Terror framing of attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN also reported.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  But the shift to strikes in the Pacific has led to concerns from other countries in Latin America that the boat strike campaign signals a broadening that could only continue.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico has long been viewed by US officials as an epicenter of the drug trade, and Trump, himself, has repeatedly inquired about sending American troops across the southern border to target cartels based there.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s previous offers to send US forces into Mexico have been rebuffed, but the ongoing US military strikes have added a new wrinkle to the already delicate relationship between the two countries, as seen by an unexpected phone call on October 27.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Navy got a call from the Pentagon that day informing officials there may be a survivor in the Pacific Ocean from a US strike.\n \n\n   \n  The call — and the strike prompting it — surprised Mexico as US officials had provided no advance warning. While still in international waters, the incident happened near Mexico’s coast immediately raising concerns about the expansion of the US counter-narcotic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The two other known survivors from earlier strikes were briefly detained on a US Navy ship but ultimately repatriated to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia – amid questions about the legality of holding them, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  In Mexico City after the October 27 call, senior Mexican officials scheduled a meeting with the US ambassador to try to understand why Mexico, a close US partner working with the US on counter-drug operations already, was not aware of the strike and what to expect moving forward. A  readout of the meeting  described it as cordial and “aimed to strengthen bilateral coordination between Mexico and the Unted States on maritime matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Weeks later, the Mexican Navy has not located the survivor from that strike after having called off its formal search and the unnamed person is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Mexico has responded to Trump’s focus on the drug trade and framing of terrorist networks driving the trade by trying to placate the Trump administration with numbers— an effort begun well before the strikes commenced. In calls between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump, Sheinbaum has kept the US president updated on progress and metrics as it relates to crime. Trump administration officials said that the two leaders have developed a good relationship, despite Sheinbaum’s public opposition to the administration’s boat strikes, and continue to work together on multiple fronts.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that countries cooperatively working with the US on drug smuggling efforts should not be concerned about unilateral US strikes on smugglers from their nations.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to help us find these people and blow them up if that’s what it takes. They’re going to help us with it,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Working with allies\n \n\n   \n  While there are strengths to effectively conducting a counter-terrorism mission at the US border, namely using the full power of the US intelligence community and military to identify vulnerabilities within these various groups, multiple current and former officials told CNN there are also obvious pitfalls.\n \n\n   \n  Those include issues related to collateral damage and managing political outrage from countries that are increasingly concerned the US may violate their sovereignty by conducting lethal strikes within their borders.\n \n\n   \n  Those are similar challenges to what US officials grappled with during the global war on terror.\n \n\n   \n  The former US intelligence official compared the US-Mexico dynamic to that of dealing with Pakistan during that time. Initially, the US refrained from conducting unilateral operations inside Pakistan’s borders, spending years asking for permission before carrying out strikes against suspected terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan never said no, the former official said, and the US eventually moved into a phase of simply notifying the country rather than asking for permission before a strike.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Pakistan, however, the Mexican government has repeatedly said no to Trump when he has raised the prospect of deploying the US military inside the country to target drug groups.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US intelligence officials have insisted that they are collaborating with the Mexican government when it comes to countering the flow of drugs and that any military or covert action carried out across the border will not be done unilaterally.\n \n\n   \n  But that has done little to ease the concerns of Mexican officials who believe that decision, ultimately, lies solely with the President.\n \n\n   \n  While all of the strikes to date have been at sea targeting boats allegedly carrying drugs, lawyers in the Trump administration have been debating potential justifications to extend those strikes to land, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  One strategy they have debated would be to identify land targets the US believes to be associated with drug trafficking and justifying those strikes with a second legal opinion that declares the host country unable or unwilling to address an imminent threat to Americans, sources familiar with the administration’s thinking said. Another possibility is to add Mexican cartels to an existing, secret list of 24 cartels and criminal organizations that the administration argues are legitimate targets. There’s no indication that a decision to conduct land strikes has been made.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the ongoing strikes in international waters are straining relations between the US and allies.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s reporting, Columbia President Gustavo Petro announced that he had ordered the country’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies until the US stops the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  It was the escalation of a public spat between Trump and Petro, who in Columbia leads a country that has been a critical partner in US efforts to combat drugs.\n \n\n   \n  That dispute reached a fever pitch when one of the two survivors of US strikes who is Colombian was repatriated.\n \n\n   \n  The man was subsequently released by Colombian authorities due to a lack of evidence that he was an alleged trafficker, according to Petro, who has continued to question the US strategy of shoot-first and ask questions later.\n \n\n   \n  “Colombia’s prosecutor’s office, independent of the government, cannot investigate without evidence. Thousands of people we captured on boats with the seized cocaine are tried in Colombia, but the method of killing them and not seizing the evidence does not allow for trials; at most, only bodies are collected, without really knowing what they were transporting,” Petro posted on social media.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/middleeast/west-bank-mosque-graffiti-settlers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"10:48:00-05:00","title":"Israeli settlers torch mosque and spray graffiti in latest West Bank attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Israeli settlers torched the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit, West Bank, and sprayed it with offensive graffiti, including 'Mohammed is a pig', in a deliberate act to provoke Muslim religious feelings.

Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli settlers torched a mosque and sprayed it with graffiti in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, according to Palestinian authorities, the latest in a surge of increasingly brazen settler attacks against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs said settlers attacked the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit in the northern West Bank, calling it a “heinous crime and a blatant assault on the feelings of Muslims.”\n \n\n   \n  “The attack resulted in parts of the mosque being set on fire and defaced with racist graffiti by settler gangs, who carry out daily assaults on Islamic holy sites and citizens’ properties amid a systematic escalation in both the frequency and nature of these violations,” the ministry statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The settlers attacked the mosque early Thursday before morning prayers, according to the Mayor of Deir Istiya.\n \n\n   \n  “Many houses and cars were not attacked, but rather the attack was on a religious symbol to provoke Muslims with offensive phrases against the Prophet [Muhammad] and Muslims,” Abdul Rahim Zidan said in an interview with state-run Palestine TV.\n \n\n   \n  Images shared by the ministry showed writing in Hebrew on the exterior of the mosque saying, “Mohammed is a pig,” a reference to Islam’s prophet, and “Not afraid of Avi Bluth.” Bluth is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commander in the West Bank, who issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the settler attacks and calling the perpetrators an “anarchist fringe youth.”\n \n\n   \n  Images showed parts of the interior damaged by fire, with a pile of charred debris scattered across the ground. The walls appear blackened with smoke and heat marks, and the glass of the windows smashed.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the attack in a statement, saying it “holds the Israeli government fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the IDF acknowledged the attack, saying it dispatched forces to the scene to “review the incident and conduct scans” and transferred the case to the Israel Police for further processing. The IDF said “no suspects were identified.”\n \n\n   \n  Some 700,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory the Palestinians want for a future state. Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are considered illegal according to international law.\n \n\n   \n    Record number of settler attacks\n \n\n   \n  Settler attacks on Palestinians and their properties have surged this year, particularly during the olive harvest season in October and November. A United Nations report released last week found that Israeli settlers launched  at least 264 attacks  in October, the largest number since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006. The repeated attacks have marred this year’s olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, dozens of Israeli settlers launched a major arson attack against an agricultural area in the northern West Bank village of Beit Lid, setting fire to a a new dairy factory and torching vehicles and tents in a nearby Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN showed the settlers pouring gasoline on cars and trucks before setting the vehicles alight. The video showed smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women wailing as men carry extinguishers and water buckets in a scramble to douse the fires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN visited the site of the attack and saw charred vehicles, and the damage left around the Bedouin community.\n \n\n   \n  Monjed Aljuneidi, an executive of Al-Juneidi Dairy and Food Company said the scene was “indescribable.” He recalled dozens of settlers scaling the factory fences from multiple directions.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was just a message to scare us, to scare our employees… to try to enforce their reality on the ground… (but) we will continue operations, they can’t stop us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf, residents told CNN at least four Palestinians were injured and required hospitalization from the attack. They said settlers beat them and killed four of their sheep.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen-year-old Nabil Dueis was tending to his livestock when the settlers rampaged the area.\n \n\n   \n  “It was terrifying, especially for the women and children…I was defensless against 100 of them…we need protection from the state” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  According to the IDF, the settlers then attacked Israeli soldiers and damaged and Israeli military vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Police initially said it had arrested four suspects for questioning following what it called “extreme violence.” at the site. But by Wednesday evening, police said they had released three of the suspects.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian foreign ministry said the series of attacks “affirms the increasing terrorism and crimes of the settlers, carried out with the direct support of the occupation government, as part of a systematic and widespread policy aimed at undermining the rights of the Palestinian people.”\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian officials called on international and Islamic institutions to take action to ensure accountability.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/lamonica-mciver-charges-new-jersey-immigration-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-05:00","title":"Judge Denies Rep.

LaMonica McIver, who was  charged with assaulting federal agents  during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her  May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center  in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  The case is a high-profile clash between Trump’s second administration and a Democratic lawmaker who has been sharply critical of the president’s policies. McIver  has pleaded not guilty  and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  The acting US attorney in New Jersey,  Alina Habba , brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision is pending.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident.\n \n\n   \n  A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a  2019 appropriations bill  spelling out that authority.\n \n\n   \n  McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/asia/south-korea-exam-flights-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"South Korea bans flights as 500,000 take crucial university admission test","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 554,000 students in South Korea took the country’s crucial university entrance exam on November 13, 2025, the highest number in seven years, linked to a 2007 birth surge.

Board, race and ‘equal protection’ through the eyes of the modern Supreme Court \n       \n  By Joan Biskupic, CNN Chief Supreme Court Analyst\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Supreme Court heard arguments in a racially charged  Louisiana voting rights case  last month, down on its ground floor a special exhibit was running a continual loop of commentary from Chief Justice John Roberts and others extolling the desegregation ruling of Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit takes advantage of the  restored bench  used by US district court Judge Ronald Davies, who ordered the enrollment of nine Black students at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Three years after the Brown ruling, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus was still fighting school integration.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s  Cooper v. Aaron  decision, arising from that Arkansas standoff, declared the state bound by Brown and reinforced the mandate of desegregation.\n \n\n   \n  The tone of the justices’ commentary in a video is lofty, such as from Justice Brett Kavanaugh: “Brown v. Board of Education is the single greatest moment, single greatest decision, in this court’s history. And the reason for that is that it enforced a constitutional principle, ‘equal protection of the laws,’ ‘equal justice under law,’ and made that real for all Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the concept of “equal protection of the laws” has shrunk with the modern Supreme Court. That has been evident in the justices’ rulings on race-based measures in education. And  during oral arguments  in the Louisiana case, Kavanaugh was among the justices who suggested the era of racial remedies, in education and voting, must end.\n \n\n   \n  As race endures as a flashpoint for the justices, the court has weakened the spirit and reach of Brown. A series of impending cases may further erode civil rights milestones.\n \n\n   \n  “Brown is a shell now,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, former president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the organization that took the lead in Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n\n   \n  “They will never reverse it,” she said of the justices. “They will just hollow it out. It’s a much more cynical project than rejecting it outright. … It is still incumbent upon this court to reconcile the decisions they’re making today with the truth of that decision.”\n \n\n   \n   Brown’s legacy , say civil rights advocates, permits race to be used in remedial policies to ensure equal opportunity and to enhance diversity. They contend Brown never required governments to be blind to race, especially as prejudice and discrimination endure.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative majority that controls today’s court has been advancing a “colorblind” ideal and rejecting the kind of race-conscious remedies upheld for decades to address historic bias.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts, Kavanaugh and others on the right-wing envision a country now in an era of racial neutrality, or as the  chief justice famously wrote in 2007 , “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  New cases are on the horizon as activists continue to take advantage of the court’s trend. The group that challenged Harvard and won a 2023 decision striking down race-based college admissions has filed a series of new lawsuits in lower courts, including one challenging the practice of Kamehameha Schools in Hawaii of giving a preference to applicants of Native Hawaiian ancestry.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the pending Louisiana dispute that began with a NAACP Legal Defense Fund claim of vote dilution in redistricting, the justices are scheduled this month to consider appeals that would test whether advocacy groups and other private parties can even bring such Voting Rights Act claims.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  accelerated  a separate line of litigation with its effort to end what’s known as “disparate impact” liability. Such lawsuits have traditionally been brought when an employer imposes a seemingly neutral policy that disproportionately hurts Blacks and other groups protected by civil rights law.\n \n\n   \n  A gap exists between the court’s declarations of equality and the country’s reality, especially considering the Trump administration’s diminishment of civil rights laws that date to the 1960s and its desire to end diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “The justices have been equating equal protection to colorblindness, and in doing that they are ignoring a history of structural racism and the continuing effects that give Black people and other people of color less opportunity,” said Jon Greenbaum, who for more than a decade was chief counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and last year founded Justice Legal Strategies.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going through a period of time where we need greater protection from the court rather than reduced protection,” said Greenbaum, the co-counsel in lawsuits arising from President Donald Trump’s removal of certain officials from independent agencies, such as the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n \n\n   \n    Division over what Brown means\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s reinterpretation of the 1954 Brown v. Board landmark was underway long before Trump first came to office. With Chief Justice Roberts at the lead, the court has ruled against school integration plans and  race-based admissions .\n \n\n   \n  The nine justices came together to offer video commentary for their Brown v. Board of Education exhibit tucked in an alcove behind the oversized sculpture of Chief Justice John Marshall. But they are themselves riven over what Brown means.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2023  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard  decision ending university race-based admissions, Roberts wrote for a six-justice majority that Brown stands for the principle that “eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” even measures that help traditionally excluded Black and Hispanic students.\n \n\n   \n  The three liberal dissenters countered, “Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. … In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts’ limited view of Brown was first on full display in the 2007 dispute over school-integration plans. He relied on the landmark as he invalidated efforts to diversify public schools in Seattle and Louisville.\n \n\n   \n  “Before  Brown , schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,” Roberts wrote. “The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again—even for very different reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted Justice John Paul Stevens to declare in dissent, “There is a cruel irony in The Chief Justice’s reliance on our decision in  Brown  v.  Board of Education.  … The Chief Justice fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools. In this and other ways, The Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court’s most important decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to reject the Seattle and Kentucky school-integration plans in that 2007 controversy, separated himself from the Roberts’ view of Brown and his “all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor” to ensure equal opportunity in schools.\n \n\n   \n  Wrote Kennedy, who retired in 2018, succeeded by Kavanaugh: “The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion.”\n \n\n   \n    Voting Rights Act\n \n\n   \n  The Louisiana redistricting case heard in October arises as the court has been erasing the protections of another milestone of the country’s civil rights era: The 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the arguments, the conservative majority may further restrict remedies for maps that dilute the electoral power of Blacks and Hispanics, particularly in the South.\n \n\n   \n  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act only after the March 7, 1965, “Bloody Sunday” attack on civil rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama. State troopers and other police assaulted the marchers with tear gas, clubs and whips.\n \n\n   \n  The pending VRA case traces to 2022, when Louisiana legislators drew a congressional-district map in which Blacks had the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the six districts, despite the fact that Blacks make up about a third of the population in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A lower US district court ruled that the map diluted Blacks’ electoral power and likely violated the Voting Rights Act; it ordered the state to redraw the map with two Black-majority districts. After the new map was crafted with two districts, White voters sued. The question for the justices is whether that second district unconstitutionally divided people by race.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a new question in a pair of appeals to be reviewed in the justices’ private conference on November 21 turns on whether only the US Justice Department – not private groups – can sue under the VRA to challenge redistricting that dilutes the power of minority voters. The  8th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a case  brought by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippawa Indians that that the VRA lacks a provision for such private lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  If the high court were to adopt that approach, few suits to vindicate voting rights would likely be brought. The Justice Department under Trump has retrenched on voting rights litigation. Even administrations interested in broadly enforcing the VRA had limited litigation resources and relied on private advocacy groups.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It was like a ray of hope’\n \n\n   \n  The exhibit highlighting Brown and the bench used by Judge Davies, known as the “Cooper Bench,” is scheduled to remain at the Supreme Court until next summer.

They  fiercely clashed  in the SFFA v. Harvard case.\n \n\n   \n  In the exhibit film, they offer observations from personal experience. Jackson refers to her parents, who grew up in the era of segregation, and were able to see her become a Supreme Court  justice.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas recalls the reverence people showed to Brown v. Board in his youth: “They would say ‘Brown,’ as though they had the familiarity of a constitutional scholar. ‘Brown.’”\n \n\n   \n  “For people who were unlettered, for people who were living in that system,” Thomas also relates, “Brown was a godsend, because it said that what was happening that we thought was wrong, they now know that this court said it was also wrong. It’s wrong, not just morally, but under the Constitution of the United States. It was like a ray of hope.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/nevada-supreme-court-fake-electors-case","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"Nevada Supreme Court Rules Case Against Pro-Trump 'Fake Electors' Can Proceed in Las Vegas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that a case against pro-Trump 'fake electors' from 2020 should proceed, overturning a prior dismissal due to venue issues.

\n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:44 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the summer of 2024, a previously healthy 47-year-old father collapsed and died in the bathroom of his New Jersey home. An autopsy provided no answers. Everything looked normal, and his death was ruled sudden and unexplained.\n \n\n   \n  His widow reached out to a friend, a pediatrician. Would she read the autopsy report?\n \n\n   \n  The pediatrician, Dr. Erin McFeely, acted on a hunch and contacted Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia who had discovered almost two decades earlier that tick bites could cause people to develop an allergy to red meat.\n \n\n   \n  The allergy is unusual because the reaction doesn’t happen right away. People start to feel sick hours after they unwittingly eat beef, pork or lamb. Often, they’ll wake up in the middle of the night with symptoms that seem more like a bad bout of food poisoning or stomach flu than an allergy.\n \n\n   \n  Because so many people have potentially been sensitized to meat after tick bites but don’t know it, Platts-Mills and others have wondered whether there were unexplained deaths that were really severe reactions to a sugar found on mammalian cells, including those in red meat, called alpha-gal.\n \n\n   \n   The man’s case , which was detailed Wednesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice, turned out to be exactly what Platts-Mills had feared and is believed to be the first documented death linked to a red meat allergy.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time I’ve heard a story that I thought we could sort out,” said Platts-Mills, who is part scientist and part Sherlock Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  “We need the serum” – the clear part of the patient’s blood – which was taken during his autopsy. He asked McFeely, “Can we get it?”\n \n\n   \n    Tick bites turn deadly\n \n\n   \n  The man’s story started with chigger bites, the case study says. But they weren’t chiggers; they were baby lone star ticks, about the size and color of a grain of sand.\n \n\n   \n  The man had been bitten by dozens of these tiny seed ticks on a camping trip with his family.\n \n\n   \n  “And this tick, the mothers, lay 5,000 eggs at a time, and the larvae will bite you,” Platts-Mills told CNN . \n \n\n   \n  In many parts of the eastern United States, the deer population has reached unsustainable numbers. Deer are the main hosts of the lone star tick, and as deer populations have grown, tick populations have exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “That combination of so many deer and so many mothers and the larvae biting means that vast numbers of people are sensitized, of whom a minority get food-related symptoms and then are at risk of severe events,” Platts-Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Alpha-gal allergy is a reportable diagnosis in only three states – Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia – so the actual number of cases in the US is not known. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates  that as many as 450,000 Americans may have the allergy, but Platts-Mills estimates that as much as 5% of the population may be sensitized to red meat because of tick bites and not know it.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are not severe and can be managed by avoiding exposure to the sugar, which is found in food as well as in some pharmaceutical products. Symptoms range in severity from itchy hives or a rash to nausea and vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the lips or face, dizziness or fainting, and severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnose the condition by taking a careful history and controlled testing for a reaction to the sugar.\n \n\n   \n  Sometime after the camping trip, the case study says, the man’s family ate a late steak dinner. He woke at 2 a.m. with intense stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. He was in rough shape, but after two hours, his symptoms subsided.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, he told one of his sons, “I thought I was going to die.”\n \n\n   \n  His wife said they considered going to a doctor, but since the symptoms had eased, they didn’t know what they would say.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that a doctor’s visit would have helped. Too often, doctors don’t recognize alpha-gal allergy.  A 2023 CDC survey  found that 42% didn’t know what it was, and 35% said they lacked confidence to diagnose or manage it.\n \n\n   \n    An unrecognized allergy\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks later, in September 2024, the man and his wife went to a cookout, where he had a hamburger about 3 p.m. He drank a beer and came home and mowed the lawn. But by 7:20 p.m., he was vomiting again. His son called his mother and told her, “Dad is getting sick again.”\n \n\n   \n  A few minutes later, the son found his father unconscious on the bathroom floor. He couldn’t be revived.\n \n\n   \n  Platts-Mills says that when he   was back in his lab, having gone through the necessary layers of permission to get the man’s postmortem blood samples, he cursed himself for not driving up to New Jersey to collect them himself.\n \n\n   \n  The delivery company lost track of them briefly, he said. He imagined them sitting for hours in the back of a hot truck, the valuable information they contained being baked away.\n \n\n   \n  They finally arrived in his lab in April, and he tested them for levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies, Y-shaped proteins primed to latch onto allergens like ragweed and pollen. The man had antibodies to both alpha-gal sugars and red meat.\n \n\n   \n  Next, Platts-Mills sent some of the blood to the Mayo Clinic lab, which tested it for an enzyme called tryptase that’s made by immune cells called mast cells. Tryptase breaks down proteins and is a marker of allergic reactions.\n \n\n   \n  The man’s tryptase levels were over 2,000 nanograms per milliliter, among the highest values ever recorded in cases of fatal allergic reactions called anaphylaxis.\n \n\n   \n  The man had died of eating red meat – the first known food allergy fatality linked to alpha-gal syndrome.\n \n\n   \n  Other people  have died of reactions to alpha-gal sugars , but those cases have involved sugars attached to a chemotherapy drug called cetuximab, which was how the syndrome was discovered in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “We gave them closure,” Platts-Mills said of the family in the case study.   “People make a big fuss about closure, but you don’t get it until you see it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/paul-ingrassia-general-services-administration-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:13:00-05:00","title":"Ingrassia Serving in New Role in Trump Administration After Withdrawing Nomination for Whistleblower Office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, a former nominee for the Office of Special Counsel in the Trump administration, withdrew his nomination after allegations surfaced of racist and conspiratorial text messages, including references to a 'Nazi streak' and disparaging remarks about Martin Luther King Jr. Day and ethnic groups.

Senate Leader John Thune said, “He’s not going to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Without support in the Senate, Ingrassia withdrew his nomination but hinted that he would stay in the administration, writing that he “will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again!”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to his nomination, Ingrassia has served as White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security, after reportedly being pushed out as White House liaison for the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n   Politico  first reported on Ingrassia’s new role at the GSA.\n \n\n   \n  Among the racist texts, Ingrassia was reported to have said that Martin Luther King Jr. Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell” and to “never trust a chinaman or Indian.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia’s lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, initially questioned the authenticity of the messages but added that if authentic, they were meant satirically.\n \n\n   \n  “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he wrote in a statement to Politico.\n \n\n   \n  “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” Paltzik added. In a subsequent statement to Politico, he said, “there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs,” and that “we do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of Ingrassia’s withdrawal came from his own Truth Social account, as pressure against him mounted. President Donald Trump, who nominated him for the position, did not post about it personally or make an official statement. A White House official confirmed at the time that he was no longer the nominee.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia would have sat before the Senate Homeland Security Committee for a confirmation hearing. However, Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who serves on the committee, said that he didn’t support him, which was a good indicator he was not going to make it through.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/jesse-jackson-hospitalized-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson Hospitalized with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, has been hospitalized with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement, balance, and eye control.

 7:42 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A British journalist and political commentator  detained  by US immigration officers for more than two weeks warned of “an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide” as he returned to the UK Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained  Sami Hamdi , a London-based father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport. ICE stopped him the day after he addressed the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) California’s annual gala, while he was en route to Florida to speak at a similar event.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. However, Hamdi and his legal team said he was in the US on a valid visa and was detained for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza as “political retaliation.”   \n \n\n   \n  Hamdi recounted his 18 day ordeal to CNN shortly after his return to London.\n \n\n   \n  “When I entered San Francisco airport to fly to Florida, I went through security. As I looked for my gate, D38 to Tampa, a man walked up to me and said… ‘your visa was revoked two days ago, so now you are here illegally.’”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said the news came as a surprise, and he told the officials who had approached him that he had not been informed his visa was under review. He said he was then presented with a memo from the US State Department that said his visa had been revoked, without a reason as to why.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about any evidence that would show that Hamdi had overstayed his visa on Thursday, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told CNN that he wasn’t able to speak on specific cases but said: “We’re going to enforce our immigration laws…We’re revoking visas when appropriate, in line with our national security.”   \n \n\n   \n  At the airport, Hamdi said he asked officers for an explanation for the revocation, saying that if there wasn’t one, he would just “book my ticket to London and fly home.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the officers then told him: “‘That’s not the way this works here,’” before escorting him out of the terminal to a vehicle that was waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said he was told to get in the car, but initially refused, telling the officers: “With the greatest of respect, this looks like the movies. I’m not getting in any black car. I’m a British citizen. I have rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his appearances on British TV, his analyses on Middle East developments, for his support of the Palestinian cause – and his criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After advocating for a phone call, Hamdi, said he briefly spoke with CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties organization, before he was taken to an ICE facility over four hours away.\n \n\n   \n  “They loaded me into a van with tight cuffs on my feet and on my hands, and they drove me four hours…and a half… I had to do a swap in the middle with a different car. And then they took me to the middle of nowhere,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At the detention center, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions, alongside nearly 100 people in an overcrowded room.\n \n\n   \n  Despite never being charged with a crime, Hamdi said he was kept in shackles in for-profit facilities with little oversight.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality is that those those facilities are dehumanizing to the human beings (there), and when you look at the stories of the other inmates, it only breaks your heart,” he said, recounting multiple stories of fathers with green cards who had been detained without charge.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not that the courts won’t find them innocent, it’s that it seems there’s a concerted effort to make sure they do not go in front of a judge,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s query on Hamdi’s claims about his time in ICE detention Thursday but Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reiterated an earlier statement that said: “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to say that this wasn’t just an attack on me. It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide. It was an attack on their freedom to speak the truth in the face of hatred,” Hamdi said shortly after he returned back to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi first came under fire after speaking at an event in London in 2023 following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. There, he told his audience not to pity Palestinians but rather to “celebrate the victory,”    in remarks from a speech that he told CNN were taken out of context.\n \n\n   \n  In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “My argument was that we have to solve the issue of the rights of the Palestinians. We have to solve the issue of occupation, apartheid, and that will bring peace to the region,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the reason that my visa was targeted was not because of anything that I was saying but it was because Americans were listening,” he said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Public opinion is shifting because people are seeing the truth,” he added, alluding to growing awareness of suffering in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has firmly denied accusations of genocide.\n \n\n   \n  Laura Loomer, a conservative American activist with a direct line to Trump, said in late October that Hamdi’s detention had come after she had applied “relentless pressure” on the State Department and DHS. She accused Hamdi of being a supporter of Hamas. CAIR has accused Loomer of being an “anti-Muslim extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi said his “detention was a stark demonstration that a Muslim journalist can be held captive because extremists, amplified on social media, seek to weaponize state policy against inconvenient speech.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights organizations have criticized the actions of the Trump administration, saying that they violate free speech protections, which apply to anyone who is legally in the US, regardless of citizenship status.\n \n\n   \n  Hussam Ayloush, CAIR California CEO, said in a Thursday statement Hamdi’s detention should “alarm anyone who cares about the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  While Hamdi said he is mulling whether to sue US authorities, he also said he would rather take what he considers a win, and instead “celebrate” the decisions of the “cool heads” in the US State Department and federal court system.\n \n\n   \n  “I won this case, the extremists failed to silence my voice, they failed to remove my freedom of speech. America stood with me,” he said, adding that he was looking forward to spending time with his family and a game of soccer over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  While he said he is grateful for the global attention brought to his case, he also implied that he is keen to exit the limelight.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not the story,” he added. “The story is one of the most heinous genocides of our time. The story is about kids who had their heads blown off. The story is about kids who had their legs blown off. The story is about innocent women and children who were bombed into oblivion for crimes they did not commit,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/asia/south-korea-yoon-drone-charges-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:40:00-05:00","title":"Phone notes that reveal an alleged plan to bait Kim Jong Un with drones","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korean prosecutors have released memos from former defense officials that allege former President Yoon Suk Yeol and senior military figures planned to provoke North Korea by sending drones into Pyongyang to drop anti-regime leaflets.

By Yoonjung Seo, Brad Lendon, Mike Valerio, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:40 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Secret drone flights from South Korea to the heart of Pyongyang were part of a ploy by the former president to rattle the North Korean leader, South Korean prosecutors have alleged as they released new details of plot they say preceded a foiled attempt to  declare martial law. \n \n\n   \n  Memos found on a senior defense official’s phone purportedly reveal plans by former president Yoon Suk Yeol and two other senior defense officials to aggravate Kim Jong Un enough to justify a shocking late-night military control order issued last December.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the evidence on Monday, appearing to confirm North Korea’s claims that South Korea sent covert drones to the country to drop anti-regime leaflets last October. The flights prompted a rare and fiery statement from Kim Yo Jong, Kim’s powerful sister.\n \n\n   \n  The North vowed to sever all road and rail connections to the South,  blowing up two roads  within its territory, but stopping short of military action. Weeks later, Yoon declared martial law, citing the need to protect the liberal South from “North Korean communist forces.”\n \n\n   \n  The snap decree was lifted within hours when South Korean lawmakers pushed past troops to vote it down, the first step in a reckoning for Yoon that’s still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n   A new indictment Monday  adds to Yoon’s mounting legal battles, which include a trial underway for alleged insurrection, and provides more pieces to a political puzzle that’s yet to be fully explained.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon denies he ordered drones to fly to Pyongyang to provoke North Korea and that he attempted to stage an insurrection through martial law.\n \n\n   \n  Yoo Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon’s lawyers, called the indictment “a one-sided prosecution” that “fails to uphold even the basic tenets of legal logic, beyond being absurd.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the spokesperson and a prosecutor for the counsel, Park Ji-young, said prosecutors were “appalled” at what they had uncovered – and on Monday they released memos they say support their claim.\n \n\n   \n    Drones buzzing Kim’s home\n \n\n   \n  The allegations date back to last October, when North Korean state media reported that South Korean drones had  violated Pyongyang’s airspace  on multiple occasions, dropping anti‑regime leaflets.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released photos showing one drone lodged in a tree, described by analysts as resembling a South Korean military unmanned aerial vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  KCNA also showed images of a drone it said was spotted flying low in the skies above the home of North’s Korean authoritarian supreme leader.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Byung-joo, a retired Korean Army four-star general now a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic Party, which sits in opposition to Yoon’s former party, told CNN in July that he had received details of the drone flights directly from whistleblowers of South Korea’s Drone Operations Command.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kim, the flights took place on at least three occasions, October 3, October 8-9, and November 13 of last year.\n \n\n   \n  “It is believed that by sending drones into the heart of North Korea and dropping leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un, the aim was to provoke a military response from the North,” the South Korean lawmaker told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like holding a knife to (North Korea’s) neck,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Kim Yo Jong issued her statement on October 12, condemning the airspace incursions and warning of “severe consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Kim Yong-hyun, then South Korea’s defense minister, initially denied sending drones to North Korea, but soon changed his response to say he “could not confirm” North Korea’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  After Yoon’s disastrous attempt to impose martial law, lawmakers from the now ruling Democratic Party demanded an inquiry into allegations the former president conspired to spark a national security crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Once in power, the lawmakers passed a bill to appoint an independent counsel, who released memos on Monday that they say reveal evidence of covert discussions about Yoon’s plans to provoke North Korea, a country with a long history of bombastic threats against South Korea and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  Among notes found on a phone belonging to the former Defense Counterintelligence Commander Yeo In-hyung were references to creating an “unstable situation,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Must find and exploit a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that can produce short-term effects. To do that, we must create an unstable situation or seize an opportunity that has been created,” read one note drafted October 18 last year, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Another note read: “Targeting where (North Korea) loses face to such an extent that they feel they have no option but to respond.” Locations listed included the capital, two nuclear facilities, Kim’s vacation homes, as well as Samjiyon and Wonsan.\n \n\n   \n  Samjiyon is regarded as a sacred site in North Korea for being the birthplace of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, and a symbolic location tied to his grandfather’s anti-Japanese resistance.\n \n\n   \n  The Wonsan-Kalma tourist area is one of Kim Jong Un’s flagship development projects, that has been hailed as a “great success” by the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Another memo from October 23 stated, “Goal and final status,” containing phrases such as “At minimum-national security crisis” and “At maximum-Noah’s flood,” in a possible reference to Noah’s Ark, where the only survivors of a biblical flood were those on board a mighty ship.\n \n\n   \n  A later note dated November 5 stated, “Enemy action must come first. There must be a wartime situation or a situation that cannot be controlled by police forces. Create the enemy’s conditions… we must wait for the decisive opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Park, the prosecutor’s spokesperson, said further details could not be disclosed due to laws concerning military secrets.\n \n\n   \n  However, she added that evidence from a notebook belonging to former Defense Intelligence Commander Noh Sang-won suggested that discussions and preparations for the martial law were believed to have begun no later than October 2023, after a major reshuffle of South Korea’s military generals.\n \n\n   \n  “The (alleged) act of the President, who holds supreme command over national security, and the defense minister, attempting to use inter-Korean military tensions to create conditions for declaring martial law, is absolutely unacceptable,” said Park.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmaker Kim Byung-joo, the retired general, said he was surprised the North Korean leader did not order a response after alleged South Korean drones were spotted over the capital.\n \n\n   \n  “In hindsight, it was a godsend luck for South Korea that North Korea refrained from any military provocation and stopped at rhetorical threats,” he said. “Had North Korea chosen to respond with military action under those circumstances, it could have escalated into a localized conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s deployment of more than 10,000 troops to Russia as combat soldiers in the war against Ukraine may have dissuaded Kim from acting further, said Kim.\n \n\n   \n  “North Korea could have found it difficult to maintain two war fronts, at the time. Because it would have meant causing a significant gap in combat capability.”\n \n\n   \n    A frustrated leader’s shocking act\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, and his former defense officials Kim and Yeo, all face charges of harming the interest of the state by helping the enemy and abusing their power. The three are already on trial on insurrection charges relating to the  martial law declaration. \n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military has yet to comment on the investigation or the indictment, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.  CNN has reached out to lawyers for Kim and Yeo. According to local media, Yeo has said he deeply regrets not challenging Yoon’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Yoon, a firebrand conservative who has long taken a hardline on North Korea, narrowly won election in 2022, but his ruling party never had a majority in parliament, and struggled to get its legislative agenda passed. It was a source of constant frustration for his administration, and towards the end of last year, that frustration exploded in spectacular fashion.\n \n\n   \n  On December 3, Yoon declared martial law in a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within the opposition parties in the government that were sympathetic to North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopters and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television.\n \n\n   \n  Though assembly members pushed through the soldiers and voted to overturn the martial law decree, Yoon’s actions triggered mass protests, legal challenges, and ultimately, his removal through impeachment.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say sending drone flights into North Korea could have been interpreted as an act of war, provoking a military response that could have escalated into war.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Peninsula has been divided ever since a brutal war between the North and South ended with an armistice agreement in 1953. But the hostilities have never officially ended and relations between the two neighbors have been precarious ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said if Yoon had ordered the drone flights, it “would represent a dangerous interaction of domestic politics and security policy” in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  “While some national security activities are necessarily clandestine and operate in legal gray areas, robust checks, balances, and policy vetting should ensure they serve national interests rather than personal agendas,” Easley said.\n \n\n   \n  Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the potential international ramifications of the case are considerable, especially for the United States, a South Korean treaty ally with tens of thousands of troops at bases on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Drone flights into North Korea, he added, would violate the armistice agreement between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that the North Koreans violate the armistice all the time, but they’re not held politically accountable for it at home,” he said. “In a democracy like South Korea you can be held politically accountable for that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-mvp-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00-20:40","title":"Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani unanimously voted MVP for fourth time; Yankees’ Aaron Judge named AL’s back-to-back winner","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani has been unanimously named the National League's Most Valuable Player for the fourth time, becoming the first player in MLB history to win MVP awards in both leagues.

CNN\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar  Shohei Ohtani  is once again adding well-deserved hardware to his growing collection and further securing his reputation as a generational talent.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese pitcher-slugger was again unanimously voted the National League’s Most Valuable Player on Thursday, the second year in a row he has been named the league’s best player. New York Yankees right fielder  Aaron Judge  took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani, sitting next to his wife,  Mamiko Tanaka , and their dog,  Decoy , when his name was announced on MLB Network, gave a lil smooch to his pup to celebrate the occasion.\n \n\n   \n  The 31-year-old is now the first player in Major League Baseball history to win the award twice in both leagues. The five-time All-Star was named the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels before leaving for the cross-town Dodgers after signing a reported  $700 million  contract.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight  World Series  win.\n \n\n   \n  The Japanese star hit 55 home runs, 102 RBI with a .282 batting average this season, highlighted by a  magical postseason run  that saw him hit three home runs on the way to the Fall Classic victory.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to  pitching  in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.\n \n\n   \n  The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a  historic season  last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all  30 votes  to win unanimously.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That’s first and foremost, it’s icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”\n \n\n   \n  He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB’s all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.\n \n\n   \n  Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.\n \n\n   \n  Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he’s won.\n \n\n   \n  “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today’s game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”\n \n\n   \n  Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher  Cal Raleigh  and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with  17  first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn’t beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”\n \n\n   \n  With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates’ 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year. Atlanta Braves catcher Drake Baldwin was named the NL Rookie of the Year.\n \n\n   \n  Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy was named the NL Manager of the Year and Guardians manager Stephen Vogt won AL Manager of the Year for the second consecutive year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/middleeast/deceased-israeli-hostage-identified-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"Israel Identifies Deceased Hostage Returned by Hamas as Manny Godard","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Israeli government has officially identified the deceased hostage returned by Hamas as Manny Godard, a 73-year-old resident of Be’eri Kibbutz near Gaza, who was killed during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.

His body was then taken to Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  During the attack, Godard and his wife hid in the safe room of their home in Be’eri Kibbutz. They later fled after their house was set on fire, and the attackers “ambushed them outside,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Thursday. After the father of four was killed, “Ayelet hid in the bushes for several hours before she was also murdered,” the forum added.\n \n\n   \n  Godard spent his childhood on Israeli beaches alongside his father, who was a lifeguard, the forum said. Later, Godard also became a lifeguard, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s National Center of Forensic Medicine confirmed his identity after his remains were released by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross and then turned over to Israeli authorities. The handover leaves three remaining deceased hostages in the Gaza Strip.\n \n\n   \n  Israel is “determined, committed and tirelessly working to bring back all of our fallen hostages for a proper burial in their homeland,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement announcing the identification of Godard.\n \n\n   \n  In a transfer that was part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement, Israel earlier said it received a coffin containing the remains via the Red Cross in Gaza and transported them to Israel’s national forensics laboratory for identification. Hamas did not identify which of the last few deceased hostages it was handing over.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ military wing said earlier Thursday that it would hand over the body of an Israeli found near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  This release of remains comes after a series of such transfers last week, including that of the longest-held deceased hostage in Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas handed over the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the final days of a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas. The transfer of Goldin’s remains was the fifth such occurrence in little more than a week, bringing Hamas down to the final few deceased hostages still in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize  rallies  in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Eitan Horn, who was  recently freed  after 738 days in captivity, said in Hostages Square last weekend: “I cannot begin my journey of healing and recovery as long as I know there are families who are not with me on this journey. We have no future without the return of all the hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  Other freed hostages have expressed the same sentiment, saying they cannot begin to heal until all of the hostages – living and deceased – have returned home.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/americas/venezuela-maduro-us-peace-message-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:19:00-05:00","title":"CNN Exclusive: Maduro Tells People in the US to Unite with Venezuela for Peace of the Americas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro delivered an exclusive message to CNN, urging the people of the United States to unite with Venezuela for the peace of the Americas and to avoid prolonged, unjust wars, referencing conflicts in Libya and Afghanistan.

     6:37 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least half a dozen major media companies have stared down legal threats from President Trump this year. Some have chosen to fight, others have opted to fold. The BBC is signaling that it will fight.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the British national broadcaster responded to a  demand letter  from Trump’s lawyers by  apologizing for an editing error  but arguing that the president doesn’t have a serious case.\n \n\n   \n  The public response indicated that if Trump goes ahead and sues, the BBC will vigorously defend itself, rather than immediately seek to settle the matter out of court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a pivotal moment in the ongoing tug-of-war between Trump and the news outlets that strive to report on him independently and confidently.\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is a fight about stopping Trump from deploying his pattern of intimidation, bluster and threats against an organization that plays a huge role in setting the global media agenda,” Joel Simon, the founding director of the Journalism Protection Initiative, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Simon, who has been  chronicling  the BBC’s efforts to expand in the US, said the dustup is also “about the ability of the British public to determine what kind of media it wants, and what kind of BBC, without Trump mucking it up.”\n \n\n   \n  In the US this year, Trump has proven adept at applying political and legal pressure to media owners — and has squeezed settlement payments and other concessions out of some, but not all, of them.\n \n\n   \n  Media critics and consumers have worried that Trump’s attempts at intimidation and dominance have caused journalists to soften and self-censor aggressive reporting.\n \n\n   \n  But some newsroom leaders and media moguls have recognized that Trump’s tests are an opportunity to reaffirm their independence.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC seems to be doing that.\n \n\n   \n  As outgoing BBC director general Tim Davie said the other day, “We have to fight for our journalism.”\n \n\n   \n    No payout, no retreat\n \n\n   \n  Let’s be clear about what happened: Someone at the BBC’s “Panorama” newsmagazine program screwed up by stitching together two different clips from Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech hours ahead of the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  No one seemed to notice the error when the documentary first aired in October 2024. But when the editing error was publicized last week, the BBC was too slow to address the controversy, giving Trump even more of an opening to target the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness  resigned on Sunday , citing the need for leaders to take responsibility, even though the mistake was made much further down the editorial chain.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, BBC chair Samir Shah acknowledged an “error in judgment” with the clip. By then, Florida-based lawyers for Trump had sent the BBC a letter claiming the documentary caused Trump “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” and warning of a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts scoffed at the letter, saying Trump’s chances of winning such a lawsuit were low.\n \n\n   \n  However, Trump has pursued other legal claims in the past despite a similarly low likelihood of success. And some institutions have folded under the pressure.\n \n\n   \n   Disney , the parent of ABC, and  Paramount , the parent of CBS, decided to strike settlement deals with Trump rather than risk court battles. Both media companies made payments toward Trump’s future presidential library, triggering widespread outrage.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as the BBC said it received a legal threat from Trump, speculation arose about a similar payout by the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  But there has been no such settlement or secret side deal, a senior BBC source told CNN. And if such a payout were ever to occur, it would be publicly disclosed. The BBC, after all, is primarily funded through license fees paid by British taxpayers.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s own news coverage of Thursday’s legal reply to Trump emphasized that the broadcaster had “rejected his demands for compensation.”\n \n\n   \n  “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the broadcaster’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s lawyers had given the BBC a Friday deadline to respond. The president had no immediate reaction to the broadcaster’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    The pros and cons of standing tall\n \n\n   \n  News outlets that have stood up to Trump this year have garnered praise from readers. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, for instance, are both fighting suits that were filed on Trump’s behalf by the same Florida law firm.\n \n\n   \n  The suit against The Times was initially  thrown out  by a judge in September for being “decidedly improper and impermissible.”\n \n\n   \n  When the lawyers refiled a shorter version, The Times was forceful in its response. “As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: This lawsuit has no merit,” a newspaper spokesperson said. “This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate P.R. attention, but The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.”\n \n\n   \n  Media executives have pointed out, however, that court battles can be costly and unpredictable.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials may find themselves hoping that Trump gets distracted and moves on to a new target.\n \n\n   \n  When Disney briefly suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel amid pressure from the Trump administration in September, the consumer backlash was swift, including in the form of Disney+ subscriber cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  And when Disney brought Kimmel back on the air — showing a willingness to fight after briefly deciding to fold — Trump made one more blustery threat against ABC. But then he evidently moved on; the government hasn’t taken any known action against the network, and the president hasn’t brought up Kimmel in nearly two months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/texas-university-race-gender-topics","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"19:03:00Z","title":"Texas A&M Professors Need Approval to Discuss Race and Gender Topics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Texas A&M University System regents have adopted a policy requiring professors to obtain approval from the university president before discussing race, gender ideology, sexual orientation, or gender identity in their classrooms.

  \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:03 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Texas A&M University System regents adopted a new policy on Thursday requiring professors to receive approval from the school’s president to discuss some race and gender topics. The changes come months after a viral video of a student confronting an instructor over her lessons threw the campus into upheaval.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy will apply to all 12 schools within the system, including at Texas A&M, the flagship campus that is one of the largest universities in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy states that no academic course “will advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” unless approved in advance by a campus president.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy appears to be the first time that a public university system in Texas has put in rules on what faculty can talk about in their classroom on the topics of race and gender.\n \n\n   \n  Other university systems in Texas have also placed restrictions on classroom instruction or have begun internal reviews of course offerings following a new state law.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the new policy say it would impede the ability of faculty to teach, undermine academic freedom and could be a violation of First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  “It really strikes at the heart of what education means and what universities do, which is circulate the exchange of knowledge without fear of retaliation, without fear censorship,” Rana Jaleel, chair of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom, said about the A&M system’s new policy.\n \n\n   \n  Various universities and their presidents around the country, including  Harvard ,  Columbia , and the  University of Virginia , have come under increased scrutiny this year from conservative critics and the administration of President Donald Trump over  diversity, equity and inclusion practices  and the schools’ responses to  campus protests. \n \n\n   \n  Last month,  Trump asked nine major universities , including the University of Texas at Austin, to agree to various provisions, including commitments to eliminate race and sex from admissions decisions, to accept the government’s strict binary definition of “man” and “woman” and to promote conservative views on campus.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy defines “race ideology” as a “concept that attempts to shame a particular race or ethnicity, accuse them of being oppressors in a racial hierarchy or conspiracy” or assigns “them intrinsic guilt based on the actions of their presumed ancestors or relatives.” The policy defines “gender ideology” as a “concept of self-assessed gender identity replacing and disconnected from the biological category of sex.”\n \n\n   \n  “The goal is transparent and document cocurricular review, not policing individual speech,” James Hallmark, vice chancellor for the Texas A&M University System’s Office of Academic Affairs, told the regents.\n \n\n   \n  In approving the policy, regents did not refer to September’s  firing of Melissa McCoul , a senior lecturer in the English department at Texas A&M University, after video was made public in which she argued with a female student over gender identity being taught in a children’s literature class. McCoul’s firing came after political pressure from Republican lawmakers, including Gov.  Greg Abbott .\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after McCoul’s termination, Texas A&M’s then president,  Mark A. Welsh III, resigned.  He did not offer a reason for stepping down but he and the school had faced political pressure and criticism, including from Abbott, after the video was posted on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Bright, president of the American Association of University Professors A&M chapter, said he believes McCoul’s case opened the door for the university system to put this policy in place.\n \n\n   \n  “Our job is to teach facts, teach the truth, and if … we have to use a litmus test of whether or not it meets someone’s approval, and it could be quite frankly their political approval, then we have no truth,” Bright, who is a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, told the AP ahead of the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  During Thursday’s meeting, eight Texas A&M professors and instructors, including Bright, spoke against the policy, with many calling on regents to rehire McCoul.\n \n\n   \n  Two A&M professors spoke in favor of the policy, including Adam Kolasinski, with the Department of Finance, who said he didn’t believe the policy violated academic freedom and that “academic freedom does not mean you get to teach whatever you want.”\n \n\n   \n  Regent Sam Torn said the policy was being put in place to “make sure we are educating, not advocating.”\n \n\n   \n  A Texas law that forbids Texas K-12 schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity took effect on Sept. 1. The law does not apply to universities and other institutions of higher education.\n \n\n   \n  Texas A&M is located in College Station, about 95 miles (153 kilometers) northwest of Houston.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/sport/baseball-mlb-clase-ortiz-plead-not-guilty-gambling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"18:16:00-05:00","title":"Cleveland Pitcher Emmanuel Clase Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges Alleging He Rigged Pitches","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Emmanuel Clase, a 27-year-old pitcher for the Cleveland Guardians, pleaded not guilty to federal charges alleging he rigged pitches to help gamblers win bets, with his teammate Luis Ortiz also implicated.

Clase also surrendered his passport and was ordered to limit his travel to New York and Ohio, refrain from gambling and submit to GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  The three-time All-Star and two-time American League Reliever of the Year was arrested and taken into custody earlier Thursday at John F.

Both are due back in court Dec. 2.\n \n\n   \n  The two pitchers have been on  non-disciplinary paid  leave since July, when MLB began investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched.\n \n\n   \n  According to prosecutors, the two accepted thousands of dollars in bribes to help two unnamed gamblers in their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on bets placed on the speed and outcome of their pitches.\n \n\n   \n  They allege that Clase, who is on the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract, began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023, but didn’t ask for payoffs until earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say Clase often threw the rigged pitches on the first pitch of an at-bat, making sure to throw the ball in the dirt and well outside the strike zone in order to assure the umpire called it a ball rather than a strike.\n \n\n   \n  During an April game against the Boston Red Sox, Clase even spoke to one of the betters by phone just before taking the mound, prosecutors contend.

Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna calling for the Justice Department to release the Epstein files — as supporters push for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  Republican sources say there’s a broad cross-section of the conference willing to support the plan — and it will be hard to limit defections.\n \n\n   \n  “No point in waiting,” one House GOP leadership source familiar with the strategy shift told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A House GOP lawmaker said of the speaker’s decision: “If you got to do it, might as well do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie told CNN on Wednesday that his hope is that a veto-proof majority will pressure the Senate to act over Trump’s opposition. It would require two-thirds of the House — or 290 votes if all members are present — for a veto-proof majority.\n \n\n   \n  “If we get less than two-thirds vote when it comes up for a vote, I think it’s an uphill battle,” Massie said. “But if we are somehow able to get two thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president.”\n \n\n   \n  A Senior White House official told CNN that Trump was made aware ahead of time that Johnson was going to expedite the vote, and that the two had spoken about it.\n \n\n   \n  “It was made clear to President Trump, and he understands that this is an inevitable reality,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson sent the House of Representatives home for its August recess early – in part to avoid a  vote  related to the Epstein files. When the House returned in September, top congressional Republicans and White House allies were working  behind the scenes  to prevent the politically charged vote. And there was even a last-ditch effort by the president and his allies on Wednesday  to engage with  two of the Republican women helping the effort move forward before it was too late.\n \n\n   \n  But now, GOP sources told CNN, part of the calculation is that the momentum in the House is unstoppable and the only course of action is to send it over to the Senate to deal with.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it out of the House,” another GOP lawmaker in support of the strategy told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, Massie and Khanna were expecting it to be weeks before their bill would get a vote on the House floor.\n \n\n   \n  Even after the bipartisan duo secured the 218 signatures needed to move forward on Wednesday, there was still a procedural process that had to play out because the effort did not have the blessing of House Republican leadership to come to the floor sooner.\n \n\n   \n  So when Johnson said Wednesday that he was going to expedite the process and put the bill on the floor next week, many were surprised.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson  said  on Wednesday, adding, “In the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given the ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the panel on Wednesday and top Trump administration officials  met with  GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of the few Republicans who signed onto the effort demanding DOJ release its trove of Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t block the parade, you might as well get ahead of it,” Khanna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  If Massie and Khanna’s bill clears the House, as is now expected, it’s fate in the Senate remains uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  Majority Leader John Thune has previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97660","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00Z","title":"Can you ace this week's test?

6:07 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge ordered the release of hundreds of people arrested as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to a court ruling, dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Of those arrested, 615 are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Cummings stated he would allow their release on a $1,500 bond and enrollment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Alternatives to Detention program, which can include electronic monitoring, pending the outcome of immigration proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered the government to identify the people who are eligible for release by noon Friday and paused deportation proceedings for them until the next business day after their release.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the immediate release of 13 people who were arrested in violation of a consent decree that limits warrantless arrests, specifying they are to be released on their own recognizance without bond or conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The judge further ordered the government to produce by November 19 the names and threat levels of the approximately 3,000 people arrested since June.\n \n\n   \n  The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and  constitutional rights  – for both documented and undocumented people – as the Trump administration’s  broad mass deportation crackdown  targets people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.\n \n\n   \n  Challenges remain for those ordered to be released, immigration experts said in response to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a  2022    settlement agreement  over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested people have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.\n \n\n   \n  Gregory Bovino, 55,  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  One of those recently arrested was  Diana Galeano , a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.\n \n\n   \n  “The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week, finding her detention unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his Customs and Border Protection agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  That news came days after Bovino was personally  called out  by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608227","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Right-wing media shrugs off latest Epstein document release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The release of newly discovered documents linking Jeffrey Epstein to Donald Trump has been met with skepticism and dismissal by right-wing media figures, who claim the emails are hoaxes or politically biased.

        By Shannon Bond \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         What do thousands of pages of  newly released material  reveal about the well-documented relationship between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and President Donald Trump? Not much of anything, according to some of the right-wing influencers who have long been clamoring for the government to release  more information  about Epstein and his crimes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"To me, these are nothingburgers. If they're even real,\" pro-Trump podcaster Jon Herold said on his Badlands Media Rumble livestream on Wednesday. Herold gained an audience in the wake of the 2020 election after  spreading QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories . His fellow Badlands Media personality, Brian Lupo, took a slightly different view on his own livestream this week. The emails didn't exactly say nothing, he claimed, but they show that Trump was informing on Epstein and his associate  Ghislaine Maxwell , who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. (Epstein died by suicide while in jail during the first Trump administration.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"My take on this is Epstein and Maxwell are trying to figure out who's a mole or a rat or an informant in their circle of friends,\" Lupo said, referring to an email in which Epstein called Trump a \"dog that didn't bark.\" (The White House has denied that Trump was an informant.) Epstein  looms large  for many  conspiracy theorists , including QAnon believers. He's seen as a prime example of the satanic cabal of pedophiles they believe are entrenched among the world's most powerful people. QAnon adherents think Donald Trump is destined to defeat that cabal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein were once friendly but fell out decades ago. He's denied any knowledge of Epstein's trafficking of underage girls. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While one of the newly released emails suggests Trump did know about Epstein's behavior, some right-wing media figures say the new disclosures prove Trump did nothing wrong. \"They're claiming it's a hoax, they're claiming that the Democrats are cherry-picking the things that make Trump look the worst, and that these things prove that he didn't actually do anything wrong and that he's not a criminal and that he was actually gathering information for the FBI on Epstein,\" said Mike Rothschild, an independent journalist and author who has written extensively about conspiracy theories and QAnon. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said that is \"very different from the song they were singing for years before that, which is that if we just bring down the Epstein ring, all of the Democrats are going to go down with him.\" Many prominent Democrats are shown communicating with Epstein in the newly released emails. Still, another common thread on the right is that the release is a  distraction  by Democrats. \"They think that the Epstein thing is something that is going to distract you from their failures, although the Epstein thing, all it's really doing is exposing more Democrat failures,\" Vince Coglianese, a radio host and the editorial director of the Daily Caller, said on his Rumble livestream on Thursday. That echoes President Trump's Truth Social posts accusing Democrats of using Epstein to deflect from fallout over the  government shutdown . On Friday, he called on the Justice Department to investigate Democrats mentioned in the emails. Attorney General  Pam Bondi said  she was appointing a federal prosecutor to lead a probe. Meanwhile, some prominent influencers and conservative media outlets are essentially ignoring this week's release of documents. \"They already know that their fans are on board 100% with whatever Trump does,\" Rothschild said. \"There's nothing for them here.\" At the same time, the emails are fueling new speculation on both the right and the left as people race to interpret Epstein's often cryptic language. To Rothschild, that is a fool's errand. \"Jeffrey Epstein was, like, not the most trustworthy person…You're taking him at his word because you want to believe him when he says things that are either good about Trump or bad about Trump,\" he said. \"It's absolutely maddening circular discourse and it gets us absolutely nowhere.\" NPR's Huo Jingnan contributed reporting to this story.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/travel/worlds-best-cheese-2025-gruyere-switzerland","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Three cheeses on, we could still taste it: Swiss Gruyère crowned the world’s best cheese","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Swiss Gruyère from Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen has been crowned the world’s best cheese in 2025 at the World Cheese Awards in Bern, Switzerland.

on, we could still taste it’: Swiss Gruyère crowned the world’s best cheese \n       \n  By Barry Neild, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:04 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Remember that time you had too much   cheese, felt a bit queasy and — as a greasy sheen broke out on your forehead — you lied to yourself that it was salad from now on?\n \n\n   \n  Then spare a thought for the heroic judges at this year’s World Cheese Awards, who assembled on Thursday to anoint an aged Swiss Gruyère as the best cheese in the world for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This army of 265 cheese experts from all over the planet was tasked with wading through dairy concoctions of every shape, size, color and consistency in a large auditorium in the Swiss capital Bern. In the space of a couple of hours, each judge plowed their way through at least 40 cheeses — sniffing, stroking, crumbling, and finally, tasting to arrive at a score.\n \n\n   \n  The winner was Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen, a cheese made from cow’s milk at a small dairy in the Alpine lowlands of western Switzerland. “It’s an incredible honor,” said cheesemaker Pius Hitz, shortly after picking up the top prize.\n \n\n   \n  While the win in previous years has resulted in a surge in sales for the champion cheese, Hitz said his herd of red and white Fleckvieh   cows can rest easy. A production increase is unlikely, he said, so as not to disturb the delicate balance of the protected Gruyère market.\n \n\n   \n  Bergkäserei Vorderfultigen may have only traveled a few miles to the awards, but it was still a long journey to the top. More so for its rivals, many of which had to navigate long plane rides, tricky import legislation and the US shutdown even before the contest started.\n \n\n   \n  No fewer than 5,244 cheeses from 46 countries made it to Bern’s Festhalle venue where, as judgment day wore on, they made their presence known with cascades of intensifying odors that collided with sound waves from an ensemble of Swiss horns tooting in the corner of the auditorium.\n \n\n   \n    Soft pools of goo\n \n\n   \n  The cheeses were divided up across 110 rows of white-clothed tables under the scrutiny of two- or three-person judging teams. All wearing matching yellow aprons, they were drawn from the community of makers, mongers and mavens who make up the ranks of the international cheese cognoscenti.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before 10 a.m., they began the Herculean labor of trying to find bronze, silver, gold and “super gold” contenders among the milk-based marvels — stripped of identifying features so they can be blind tasted — stretching before them.\n \n\n   \n  Holes were bored in giant waxy wheels, slivers shaved from wedges, spoons dipped into soft pools of goo. In between tastings, palates were cleansed with sips of water, bites of crunchy apples and, in some cases, emergency swigs of Coca-Cola.\n \n\n   \n  There were cow, sheep, buffalo, camel and donkey milk   cheeses. Manchegos, Bries, Camemberts, cheddars, Parmesans, Goudas. Orange cheeses, blue cheeses, green cheeses. Cheeses covered in wax. Cheeses covered in flowers. At least one cheese doused in whiskey and red apple juice.\n \n\n   \n  Some were hard. Some crumbly. Some dense. Some were light and fluffy. Some were so soft they needed to be in jars. Some, their tops cut off to reveal a moist interior glistening with mold, looked as if they might teem with lifeforms as yet unknown to science.\n \n\n   \n  All were awarded points based on appearance, smell, taste, texture and the feeling it gives in the mouth — not always a pleasant experience, apparently.\n \n\n   \n  “There were a couple of no-swallows today,” said Emma Young, a UK cheesemonger and author judging the wares laid out on table 26, pointing out a cheese that she thought might have encountered problems during the making process.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t all bad.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s bonkers,” Young added. “I’ve tasted some of the best cheeses I’ve had in my life — and some of the worst. It’s been so much of a palate workout.” She pointed to a cheese that earned top marks thanks to a “complexity” she put down to the varieties of milk used.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Biting into a cloud’\n \n\n   \n  “If only it tasted as beautiful as it looks,” said Ashley Morton, a judge on table 11, where an unusually bright blue cheese, made using spirulina algae, was attracting camera phones. Morton, a “cheese ambassador” originally from New York who goes by the nickname Brieyoncé, favored a raw goat cheese coated in a gray substance that was “almost like biting into a cloud.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look at the fruit level here,” said Jen Shelton, an organic milk expert originally from Kansas, discussing a large wheel of cheese covered in pressed grapes with fellow table-52 judge Charles Beauquesne, from France. The cheese then scattered onto the table. “It’s very crumbly,” she added. “Milky, but quite dry. The grapes give it a little bit of sweetness, but it’s claggy.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair made a note of the cheese’s score, wiped down their utensils with a paper towel   and moved on to the next candidate.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, many of the judges had made their final selection, carrying “super gold” winners to a separate judging area where a team of seasoned cheese experts pared the field down to 14 finalists. These were then tasted and scored live on stage, like an aromatic “Dancing with the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  The shortlist included a Japanese soft goat’s cheese with a texture like whipped cream, a UK hard cheese the color of a deep sunset, one US cheese and, inevitably, several more Swiss cheeses. It’s widely recognized that entries from the host country have a home advantage — cheeses are not great travelers — but locals don’t always take the crown. A Gruyère won in 2022 when the contest was staged in Wales.\n \n\n   \n  John Farrand, managing director of the event’s organizers, the UK-based Guild of Fine Food, said the World Cheese Awards stand out above other dairy contests around the planet because it can claim to be truly global — staged in different countries and involving such a diverse cast of entrants and judges. In 2026, the contest will move to Córdoba in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  The winning cheese of 2025 was championed by Perry Wakeman, one of the top-level judges who normally is found aging cheese at Rennet & Rind, near Cambridge, England. The Gruyère was a worthy winner, he said, describing its complexity: “Butterscotch, caramel. Savory, some fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal. The length was unbelievable. Three cheeses on, we could still taste it.”\n \n\n   \n  For onlookers, the cheese judging could be a frustrating process. Concerns over foot and mouth disease and other agricultural health problems meant that only judges who’d signed a waiver were permitted to sample the produce under the terms of the contest’s special import license.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the day, the auditorium tables were still groaning with leftover cheese that would sadly never be eaten. The contest organizers said that the remnants don’t completely go to waste, but would be recycled locally and “turned into energy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-13","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00-05:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a 43-day federal government shutdown—the longest in U.S. history—President Donald Trump signed a compromise bill that ended the impasse.

federal government? \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:15 PM EST, Thu November 13, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  longest federal government shutdown  in history is over.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump on Wednesday night  signed  the compromise bill that ended the 43-day shutdown soon after the legislation  passed the House .\n \n\n   \n  The  Senate approved  the package on Monday evening.  Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the bill extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the package, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions will continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The package fully funds the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance. Agriculture Sec. Brooke Rollins  told CNN  that all recipients should see their full funding by Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also replenishes SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund will also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It includes funding for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, rural health, caregivers, women’s health, veterans’ homelessness prevention, mental health and child care.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers\n \n\n   \n  The legislation also guarantees retroactive pay for the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown. Many missed two full paychecks, as well as a partial one, though they should receive their  back pay  in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Though President Donald Trump signed a bill during the 2018-2019 impasse that ensured federal workers would get back pay, the administration  called into question  whether furloughed employees would be compensated when this shutdown ended.\n \n\n   \n  The package also reverses several agencies’ efforts to implement staffing reductions during the shutdown, stating that workforce levels will return to what they had been prior to the lapse in appropriations. It also prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven agencies sent reduction-in-force notices to  roughly 4,000 workers  in October, though the actions were  paused  by a federal court.\n \n\n   \n    Notifying lawmakers under investigation\n \n\n   \n  The deal includes a section that requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called Arctic Frost, which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register electoral college votes for Trump from states that former president Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Rep.

covered devastating storm cuts jobs \n         By Jeff Brady \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 4:04 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         KWIGILLINGOK, Alaska – When the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit this Alaska Native village last month, Ryan David was at home with his four children. They felt the house shake in the wind, then as floodwaters came, the building floated away. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I yelled at my kids to get up and group up here, on the stairs, just in case we tip over,\" David said when he  talked with public broadcaster KYUK . He and his children were still trapped inside. David says the home stopped floating when it hit a bridge. He talked with a KYUK reporter as he waited for rescuers to arrive. A month later, as villages across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta clean up from the storm and make repairs, hundreds of residents remain evacuated to cities such as Anchorage and Bethel. Now they face another loss. One of the few sources of local news and native language programming — public radio and television station KYUK — has lost federal funding that was  up to 70% of its budget  and plans to make cuts in January. The station plans to severely cut staff and some programming as it tries to raise money to fill the budget gap. The broader public media landscape is also experiencing  a loss of federal funding , including at least some money for improving  emergency alert systems , as human-caused climate change from burning fossil fuels is heating the planet and  increasing risks from extreme weather . In remote villages KYUK is \"crucial\" KYUK broadcasts out of a small tan building at the base of a tall tower in Bethel, Alaska — about 400 miles west of Anchorage. Bethel is a hub community for  56 tribes spread across 48 communities . The station says its coverage area is about the size of Louisiana. KYUK has been on the air since 1971 and \"is a  Native American initiated public broadcasting  joint licensee\" — that means it has both a public radio and television stations. It also has a  digital news website  and serves a predominantly Yup'ik population of less than 30,000 people in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Many residents, especially elders, primarily speak the Yup'ik language Yugtun. \"It's very crucial to have that KYUK network,\" says Darrel John, a lifelong resident of Kwigillingok. He says the news in Yugtun is especially valuable. \"A lot of great advice we listen to from the elders… Any updates from any other communities — you know what to look out for — and the upcoming events.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Each weekday, as  Morning Edition  ends, there's local news and the weather forecast in Yugtun. \"Weather is definitely one of the things that KYUK focuses on because it's life or death,\" says Sage Smiley, KYUK news director. In a place where there are few roads, residents sometimes drive on frozen rivers and need to know where it's safe to do that. \"Getting from community to community in a boat, on a snow machine, in a bush plane, the weather matters almost more than anything else,\" Smiley says. When it became clear the remnants of Typhoon Halong were headed toward the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Smiley says reporters started including that in their reports to warn residents. She says fall storms and even flooding are common in the region, but Halong was different from most. \"This storm took a track that was unexpected, hit south of where it was expected to and in an area that was less prepared for the storm to hit,\" Smiley says. \"I think all of those factors went into what made it so devastating.\" Three people in Kwigillingok died because of the storm. Nearly every building in the village was damaged. Overall  more than 1,600 people were displaced , many of them evacuated in helicopters. Smiley also coaches the high school swim team and was at a meet in another city when the storm arrived. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I was working remotely from a minivan with the swim team while the rest of the [news] team was working on the ground here,\" Smiley says in the news department studio in Bethel. \"And we had collaborators in Anchorage who were helping draft scripts and call communities to figure out what was happening.\" That's part of being a news director at a small station, but soon KYUK will try to report the news with a third less staff, because in January Smiley's position will be among those cut. KYUK loses funding and makes cuts KYUK was already navigating a loss in funding  from the state of Alaska  when President Trump  targeted public media and Congress eliminated funding  this summer. It was a big hit to the station's finances because federal funding has been up the bulk of its budget. The federal money essentially paid for employee salaries and benefits. \"It's a little over $1 million that we're receiving each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our salaries and benefits in FY 25 [fiscal year 2025] was also a little over $1 million,\" says Kristin Hall, KYUK's general manager. The station had 10 full- time employees and 13 part-time or on-call workers, says Hall. \"Beginning in January, KYUK will transition to four full-time employees and ten part-time and on-call employees.\" In deciding where to make programming cuts, Hall says preserving Yup'ik language programs was a priority. A daily interview program,  Coffee at KYUK , will lose three episodes a week in English, but keep its weekly Yugtun episode. The station's technical director's hours will be cut from 40 to 10 hours a week, something Hall says she's particularly concerned about because that person trouble shoots engineering problems and helps the station manage power outages. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       To bring in more revenue, Hall says the station is applying for grants, trying to sell more underwriting announcements and will hold two pledge drives each year instead of just one. The station also expects to receive one-time funding through a Trump administration promise to provide  $9.4 million for tribal broadcasting . Hall says the station will re-evaluate in March 2026 whether the workload is sustainable for the smaller staff. So, more cuts could still come. \"My employment here was hanging on by a hair,\" says Sam Berlin, a long-time host of the Yugtun language talk show  Yuk to Yuk . \"But the people, God bless them, they got together and we raised over $100,000 with our fundraiser.\" Just before Typhoon Halong hit the region, KYUK raised the money during its  fall fundraiser . \"It was our most successful we have ever seen in the history of KYUK,\" Hall says. That helps, but doesn't fill the funding gap. Raising money in a region with fewer than 30,000 people and with a poverty rate that's  twice the national average  is difficult. Hall says many people live a subsistence lifestyle, which means they may not have money to give. \"The encouragement that we get from local folks aren't always in dollars,\" Hall says. She says one person baked blueberry muffins to support the fundraiser and someone else dropped off salmon strips. Hall says an elder came to the station, and in an act of generosity, poured out her purse on the break room table. \"And everything that fell out was less than $3. And she said, 'I want you to have it.' And it was literally everything in her purse.\" Hall says the station hopes its funding strategy will be enough to support the smaller team after January. If KYUK doesn't exist, there's no one else doing the station's level of journalism in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. \"In terms of local news and information, and especially local news and information in Yup'ik, No, there is no one else,\" Hall says.

Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no corporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted publicly. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Alaska Native communities are still cleaning up after Typhoon Halong devastated two villages last month. Hundreds are still evacuated, and now they face another loss. One of the few sources for local news and information, public radio and television station KYUK, says it plans to cut its staff and its programming. That's after President Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated money for public media, wiping out much of the station's funding. NPR's Jeff Brady has this story. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: When the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit the village of Kwigillingok on Alaska's rural southwest coast, David Ryan's (ph) house floated away with him and his four children inside. While waiting for rescuers, he talked on the phone with KYUK. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) RYAN DAVID: The flood lifted us up, and I didn't think it was going to happen. And I'm like, I yelled at my kids to get up and group up here on the stairs just in case we tip over. BRADY: The house did not tip over. It hit a bridge and stopped. About four dozen homes floated away like this in the storm, thankfully inland with the storm surge and not out to sea. In this isolated village with no roads to the outside world, all-terrain vehicles are how people get around. In Kwigillingok, KYUK is a crucial source of information, especially as a hotter climate from humans burning fossil fuels makes storms like Halong more intense. Lifelong resident Darrel John says the station's Yup'ik language programs are especially valuable. DARREL JOHN: A lot of great advices we listen to from the elders, any updates from any other communities, you know, what to look out for or any upcoming events. BRADY: Over more than 50 years, KYUK has become a connecting resource for this sparsely populated region, which is about the size of Louisiana. The station broadcasts from a small building at the base of a tall tower in the town of Bethel. Each weekday, as Morning Edition ends, there's local news and, very important in a place where people drive over frozen rivers in the winter, the weather forecast in the Yup'ik language. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Yup'ik). BRADY: KYUK was already navigating funding cuts from the state of Alaska when President Trump targeted public media and Congress eliminated funding this summer. KYUK General Manager Kristin Hall says federal money essentially paid for the staff. KRISTIN HALL, BYLINE: It's a little over $1 million that we were receiving each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our salaries and benefits in FY25 was also a little over $1 million. BRADY: Federal funding has been up to 70% of KYUK's budget. Hall says the station had 10 full-time employees, but after January, that'll be down to four. As the station transitions to more part-time and on-call workers, it's cutting a daily interview program to two days a week and may have to end other programs next year. HALL: Essentially, the news director position is being cut. BRADY: Sage Smiley is currently KYUK's full-time news director. She's also the local high school swim coach and was at a meet in another city when the remnants of Typhoon Halong arrived. SAGE SMILEY, BYLINE: I was working remotely from a minivan with the swim team while the rest of the team was working on the ground here, and we had collaborators in Anchorage who were helping draft scripts and call communities and figure out what was happening. BRADY: In January, Smiley says her hours will be reduced to about five per week, essentially cutting the newsroom staff by a third. The station has prioritized keeping Yup'ik language programs, such as the weekly talk show Yuk to Yuk with longtime host Sam Berlin. SAM BERLIN, BYLINE: My employment here was hanging on by a hair, but the people - God bless them - they got together. And we raised over 100,000 with our fundraiser. BRADY: That helps but doesn't fill the gap. Raising money in a region with fewer than 30,000 people and with a poverty rate that's twice the national average is difficult. The station is applying for grants, trying to sell more underwriting announcements and will hold more pledge drives. The station hopes that will raise enough to keep KYUK on the air with a smaller staff. Jeff Brady, NPR News, Bethel, Alaska.

Now she's been put on leave \n         By Andrea Hsu \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 2:09 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institutes of Health, says she has been put on paid leave following the end of the government shutdown. \"I was not given a reason for being put on leave, but I strongly suspect it is because I have been speaking up in my personal capacity about the harms that I have been witnessing inside the National Institutes of Health,\" she said in  a video posted to TikTok . The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\" She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize  a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists , pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk. In  an interview with NPR in early October , Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes. \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\" Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\" Agriculture Department employee also on leave On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave. Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about food assistance programs in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.  \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\" MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity. A right to speak on matters of public concern Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest. She points to a  1968 Supreme Court decision  that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights. \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\" Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out. \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. And I was determined not to do that.\" NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97954","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-05:00","title":"Trump cuts ties with Marjorie Taylor Greene, once among his top MAGA-world defenders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has officially distanced himself from Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a central figure in the MAGA movement, calling her 'Wacky Marjorie' and stating he would support a challenger against her in the 2026 midterms.

Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The dismissal of Greene — once the epitome of \"Make America Great Again,\" sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union address and acting as a go-between for Trump and other Capitol Hill Republicans — appeared to be the final break in a dispute simmering for months, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term U.S. House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies. Accusing the Georgia Republican of going \"Far Left,\" Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\" In a response on X, Greene wrote Friday that Trump had \"attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said \"is what sent him over the edge.\" Greene called it \"astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" referencing next week's U.S. House vote over releasing the Epstein files. Writing that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\" Trump's post seemingly tied a bow of finality to fissures that widened following this month's off-cycle elections, in which voters in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races flocked to Democrats in large part over concerns about the cost of living. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last week, Greene told NBC News that \"watching the foreign leaders come to the White House through a revolving door is not helping Americans,\" saying that Trump needs to focus on high prices at home rather than his recent emphasis on foreign affairs. Trump responded by saying that Greene had \"lost her way.\" Asked about Greene's comments earlier Friday as he flew from Washington to Florida, Trump reiterated that he felt \"something happened to her over the last month or two,\" saying that, if he hadn't gone to China to meet leader Xi Jinping, there would have been negative ramifications for jobs in Georgia and elsewhere because China would have kept its curbs on magnet exports. Saying that people have been calling him, wanting to challenge Greene, Trump added, \"She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.\" Greene's discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn't run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn't win. In June, she publicly sided with Tucker Carlson after Trump called the commentator \"kooky\" in a schism that emerged between MAGA and national security hardliners over possible U.S. efforts at regime change in Iran. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That only intensified in July, when Greene said she wouldn't run for governor. Then, she attacked a political \"good ole boy\" system, alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state. Greene embarked on a charm offensive in recent weeks, with interviews and appearances in media aimed at people who aren't hardcore Trump supporters. Asked on comedian Tim Dillon's podcast if she wanted to run for president in 2028, Greene said in October, \"I hate politics so much\" and just wanted \"to fix problems\" — but didn't give a definitive answer. That climaxed with an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show \"Real Time,\" followed days later by a Nov. 4 appearance on ABC's \"The View.\" Some observers began pronouncing Greene as reasonable as she trashed Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana for not calling Republicans back to Washington and coming up with a health care plan. \"I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin. \"Maybe you should become a Democrat, Marjorie,\" said co-host Joy Behar. \"I'm not a Democrat,\" Greene replied. \"I think both parties have failed.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609367","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is over.

Here's what you need to know \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The government is back open. It was  the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 43 days . There are lots of questions about what this means, how we got here and where we go from here. Let's answer some: Why did it start? The Democratic base has been urging its leaders to show more fight. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught tremendous blowback in March for doing an about-face and going along with Republicans to keep the government open despite what the left saw as an odious spending bill. When the latest funding fight came up, Schumer this time showed a united front with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Arm in arm, they refused to go along with continuing to fund the government, and made the key issue extending health care subsidies, which, if not extended, would mean tens of millions of Americans would see their health care costs increased. How did it end? It ended without the health care extensions Democrats were fighting for. Eight moderate senators crossed the aisle and indicated Sunday night that they had struck a deal with Senate Republicans to reopen the government. The reason they didn't hold out longer, this group said, was because it was obvious President Trump and congressional Republicans weren't going to negotiate, and too many people were suffering. The Trump administration — correctly — gambled that enough Democrats would not be able to stomach the amount of pain the administration was willing to inflict on the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and more than 3 million federal workers. So what does the bill do? The bill  passed by Congress and signed by Trump  funds the government until Jan. 30 with carveouts for SNAP, benefits targeted at women, infants and children, or WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Congress. Those will all be funded until the end of September 2026. It notably also tries to rectify the firings and loss of pay to federal workers, although it's a leverage point the Trump administration could use again if the government were to shut down again after Jan. 30. There is also money for  increased security  for members of Congress, executive branch officials, judges and Supreme Court justices. Several Republican members were outspoken about this after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. If the government is only funded until Jan. 30, does that mean there could be another shutdown soon? It's possible. It depends on a few things. What lessons do Democrats take out of the shutdown? Does the fire within the base subside some between now and then? And is there an actual vote on health care subsidies? OK, so what about those health care subsidies? It's not clear yet, but the lack of a negotiation on them likely means they will expire unless enough moderate Republicans, feeling pressure in their districts, cross over to strike a deal with Democrat — and Republican leadership, including and especially Trump, go along with it. But that seems highly improbable — and tens of millions of people would see their premiums go up. If that's the case, what was the point of the shutdown? That's a question a lot of people, especially those left of center, are asking. They see what moderate Democrats did as caving to Republicans. The reality is, though, the 8 moderate senators, who caucus with Democrats and took this deal, didn't want to see regular people feel more unnecessary pain — and they saw no hope for Republicans to compromise after what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Democrats did accomplish something in this shutdown, though. They elevated the issue of health care, and if Republicans block the extension of subsidies, then they will likely own increased health care costs in voters' minds. What does this mean for federal workers and flight delays? Government workers will get back to work, and recent mass layoffs are to be reversed. Furloughed workers were missing paychecks. As far as airports, there are already signs of easing, but it will likely be several days or more until everything will get back to normal. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that more air traffic controllers are heading back to work, but in the very short term, flight reductions at some major airports will continue. Were there any surprises? Yes, there were a few. First, there's drama around a provision slipped in the bill that would allow senators to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 each, if they were subject to subpoenas or had their phone records accessed as a result of DOJ's Jan. 6 investigation. House Republicans pledged to pass a resolution repealing that provision, but there's no guarantee of that or that the Senate will go along. There was also a clash about hemp regulation between two Republican senators from the same state. The disagreement between Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul  got pretty heated . The bill also shines a light on  how hundreds of local projects are funded  — from the purchasing of equipment for a college in the Virgin Islands, the establishing of a veterinary doctorate program in Maryland, urban forest conservation in Texas and asbestos abatement in Alaska to funding for local hospitals, rural community facilities, youth centers, fire stations, and so, so much more. It's earmarks — funding not voted on or allocated through the formal appropriations process but tacked on in spending bills — that pay for all of these things. One day, there will be a vet that will say he or she got a degree from the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — and it'll all be because of the funding deal to reopen the government. Ah, democracy. Is there a guarantee on a health care vote? No. The moderate Senate Democrats, who crossed over to open the government, thought so, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said shortly after the deal was reached that he wouldn't commit to a vote. Whether the vote happens or not, if health care subsidies are not extended, it will be because of Republicans — and that will mean they will own higher health care costs heading into an election year. What does this mean for the Epstein files? The end of the shutdown meant the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election in Arizona replacing her late father. That's key because she signed onto a discharge petition trying to compel the Justice Department to release the files associated with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and her support gave a majority to those who want to see them released. Johnson, who is close to Trump, has argued compelling the release is not necessary — though the president has made clear he does not want them released in full and his Justice Department has not taken public steps to do so. Even if it passes, though, it will largely likely be symbolic. The Senate is unlikely to get the required 60 votes. Trump would, of course, like it to fail in the House. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of three Republicans who have also signed the discharge petition, met in the White House Situation Room, apparently about Epstein. Boebert did not remove her name even after the meeting. The day the shutdown ended, more investigative materials were released from the House Oversight Committee, including a leak from committee Democrats pointing specifically to emails from Epstein's estate, showing Epstein implying that Trump knew about the girls. Any day Trump is talking about Epstein is not a good day for the White House. Who winds up with the political advantage out of the shutdown? Democrats really upset their base — again. Progressives continue to feel like they get rolled by party leaders. At the end of the day, though, Democrats are likely the ones who got the most out of the shutdown and will have  the advantage in the midterm elections . Consider that Democrats are coming off huge wins across the country earlier this month in the off-year elections. The central issue in those elections was affordability. And through the shutdown, they elevated the issue of health care. The party and its candidates will likely be able to campaign on both of those issues next year, and with Republicans in charge, that will help Democrats — if they can mend fences with their base, that is. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609389","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"As funding falters, young brain scientists rethink careers in research","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As federal funding for brain science in the United States faces significant disruptions from the NIH and NSF—driven by policy changes under the Trump administration—many young neuroscientists are reconsidering their careers.

Hamilton \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 7:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A decades-long boom in brain science in the United States may be heading for a bust. Ongoing disruptions in federal funding are causing many young brain scientists to reconsider their career choice, according to leaders of the  Society for Neuroscience  (SfN), which represents more than 37,000 researchers and clinicians. If those scientists change fields or leave the country, SfN officials say, it could hobble the nation's efforts to understand and treat brain disorders including Alzheimer's, autism, Parkinson's and schizophrenia. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The U.S. has been a world leader in research for decades, and that leadership position is now at risk,\" says  John Morrison , a professor at the University of California, Davis and president of SfN. Morrison expects that discussions about federal funding are likely to have a prominent place in the group's annual five-day meeting, which begins Saturday in San Diego and is expected to attract about 20,000 brain scientists. \"It's hard to escape, because we're all being directly affected by it,\" Morrison says. Science, disrupted In the months since President Trump took office, the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation have been buffeted by cuts, grant terminations, and abrupt policy changes. Federal health officials have said those measures reflect an effort to reduce fraud and waste, end support of 'woke' science, and align research with the administration's priorities. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the process has been unsettling for young scientists like  Clara Zundel , a postdoctoral researcher at Wayne State University in Detroit. Zundel, who studies how pollution affects the developing brain, currently has funding from the National Institutes of Health. But consideration of an NIH grant that would extend her funding has been delayed, she says. As a result, she decided not to spend the money to attend this year's neuroscience meeting. Instead, she's focusing on finding a job in an increasingly tight market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Many universities are still on partial or even full hiring freezes,\" Zundel says. \"So it's just made it really scary to think how I'm going to take that next step.\" Zundel isn't ready to abandon her career plans just yet. \"I absolutely love what I do, and I want to continue doing what I do,\" she says. Still. \"Talk to me in another three months,\" she says, \"and I might change my mind.\" Other young researchers are even less certain, Morrison says. \"You hear things like, 'I've prepared my whole life for this. Is it gone now? Is it no longer possible to be the scientist that I always wanted to be?'\" he says. \"Many will just choose something else.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Others may take their research to another country. And if funding cuts and uncertainty persist, Morrison says, the field of neuroscience could lose a whole generation of scientists. Congress funds, White House cuts    The NIH often awards five-year grants, and scientists tend to structure their research around that timeline. But in recent months, many grants have been paused or prematurely terminated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If you disrupt the grant in the middle, the work you've already done [may be] worthless,\" Morrison says. He also challenges the administration's claim that it is saving taxpayers' money. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the long run, he says, the human and financial costs of cutting research will be huge. Take Alzheimer's. Research into the neurodegenerative disorder costs the federal government a few billion dollars per year, Morrison says. But caring for people with the disease costs far more — hundreds of billions of dollars a year. And that cost, he says, will continue to rise until researchers find better treatments or a way to prevent the disease. Morrison says it's an excellent example of a principle expressed by the late  Mary Lasker , a philanthropist and champion of medical research, who famously said: \"If you think research is expensive, try disease.\" That sentiment is one reason brain science has long enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, says  Diane Lipscombe , a professor at Brown University and chair of government and public affairs at the Society for Neuroscience. Another is that, ever since World War II, science has been a huge boost to the U.S. economy, she says. That's because publicly-funded research not only helps train future physicians and scientists, it leads to new drugs and medical devices, biotech companies that spin off from universities, and patents on vaccines, cancer treatments, and even gene-editing technology. \"I don't think we've ever talked with anyone in the [House] or Senate who disagreed with that,\" Lipscombe says. But the current round of cuts and disruptions have come from the executive branch, not Congress. So neuroscientists are taking their case directly to the public. The Society's website, for example, now includes  links  to videos of scientists explaining the work they do and why it matters. Lipscombe thinks that message will be heard. So when she talks to young scientists asking for career advice, she tries to offer an optimistic message. \"You just have to stay with what you love because things will get better,\" she says. At least, that's the hope. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607162","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The deal to end the shutdown exposed rifts among Democrats.

Just ask Maine \n         By Kevin Miller \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         AUGUSTA, Maine — This week's  vote to end  the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along partisan lines. Yet the bill to reopen the government was reliant upon Democratic lawmakers of both chambers who joined Republicans, exposing rifts within the Democratic Party. That political divide was clearly evident in Maine's congressional delegation — and the  public's reaction to how they voted . \"Well, Angus really hurt us in Maine,\" said Donna Doucette who, like many folks in Maine, refers to Sen. Angus King by his first name. King — an independent who caucuses with Democrats — was among eight minority party senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen government. Doucette was one of about two dozen protesters holding signs along a busy street in Waterville on a recent cold and blustery November afternoon. The protesters, many of whom are part of the local Indivisible chapter, were opposed to the deal  ending the government shutdown . \"I've supported him from the beginning and I think he sold us out. Especially when I'm retired, still dealing with cancer — I don't need that now. Nor does my husband, who is even older than me,\" she said. As part of the deal, Senate Republicans promised a future vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. But critics say they betrayed the Democratic cause by failing to secure an actual extension of the tax credits that roughly 20 million ACA users rely upon to lower their premiums. Without congressional action, the average premium is  expected to more than double  after December 31st. Some protesters brought signs calling King a coward. Cindy Burke said he caved. \"We held out for 40 days, I think, and I just feel that we got nothing from it,\" said Burke. \"And a promise to have a vote on the ACA, I don't believe that is going to happen. I don't trust the Republicans.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A small delegation with a significant split  Maine's four-person congressional delegation is one of the smallest in the country. Yet their  mixed votes on the bill  to reopen the government reflect the national divide over the fraught issue. Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins blamed the shutdown on Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Yet as chairwoman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins  helped broker the compromise  that funds the government through January 30 and fully funds some agencies through September 30. Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, supported extending the ACA subsidies but blasted his party's shutdown strategy. He cast one of his party's six House votes to end the shutdown. His fellow Maine Democrat, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, views the compromise as a \"capitulation,\" particularly after the Democratic victories nationwide during the Nov. 4 election. \"Many of us felt like there was a lot of momentum behind us,\" said Pingree. \"And the Republicans are feeling these concerns. They are losing court battles and they are getting the same calls that we are. We should move them to a decision, not the promise of a vote.\" Angus King said in an interview with Maine Public Radio earlier this week that he's surprised by the  ferocity of the backlash , although he understands the sentiment. \"I understand because millions of people in this country are gravely worried and angry and frankly scared about the future of their country because of what Donald Trump is doing,\" King said. \"I'm with them. I've been to the 'No Kings' rallies here in Maine.\" But King defended his decision, saying Republicans made clear they would not negotiate on the ACA until the government reopened. Government shutdowns rarely secure policy concessions for the minority party. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Although he supports extending the subsidies, King said the shutdown harmed Americans — and empowered Trump. That's why King voted with Republicans more than a dozen times to avoid or end the shutdown. \"And I get it: people want some place to stand up and they felt this was it,\" King said. \"But it's backfiring in a sense that it is hurting a lot of people without getting what we want.\" Independents play a key role in upcoming elections It's unclear how shutdown partisanship will impact next year's elections in Maine — a state where  30 percent of voters  are independents. And Maine could play an outsized role in control of Congress after 2026. Golden isn't seeking reelection in a House district that Trump won twice, giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat. And the shutdown is already popping up in the heated Democratic primary to challenge Collins, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans. Collins has not yet announced that she is running for reelection, although she is aggressively fundraising. \"I want to reiterate my call for Leader Schumer to step down,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, a Marine Corps veteran and oysterman whose anti-establishment message has drawn huge crowds, despite recent controversy over past online comments and a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner has said  he didn't realize the connection  when he received the tattoo as a young infantryman and recently had it covered. Platner denounced the shutdown deal, blaming Schumer — who opposed the deal but couldn't keep his party unified against it. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate. \"The governor has Chuck Schumer's phone number. She should give him a call and have a chat about that.\" For her part, Mills said this week that she strongly disagrees with the deal to end the shutdown. \"I appreciate Senator King's efforts here, but it's not going to work,\" Mills said on MSNBC. \"The mere promise of taking it up, putting it on the calendar, talking about it in December . . . Maine people can't wait.\" Back in Waterville, protest organizer Karen Heck said she's frustrated — with King, with her Democratic Party and with politicians, in general. \"I just think that most people are tired of a government that doesn't work for them,\" Heck said. \"Whether that's a schism in the Democratic Party or not, I think that this old system, the old system is not working for us. And a lot of people are angry about that.\" Heck added that she thinks people will demand a change — possibly starting in next year's primaries. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97958","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:48:00-05:00","title":"At Trump's urging, Bondi says U.S. will investigate Epstein's ties to political foes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to President Donald Trump’s public demand, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate alleged connections between Jeffrey Epstein and political figures, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.

Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years, didn't explain what supposed crimes he wanted the Justice Department to investigate. None of the men he mentioned in a social media post demanding the probe has been accused of sexual misconduct by any of Epstein's victims. Hours before Bondi's announcement, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would ask her, the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman. Trump, calling the matter \"the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans,\" said the investigation should also include financial giant JPMorgan Chase, which provided banking services to Epstein, and \"many other people and institutions.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" the Republican president wrote, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian interference in Trump's 2016 election victory over Bill Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Asked later Friday whether he should be ordering up such investigations, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: \"I'm the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I'm allowed to do it.\" In a July memo regarding the Epstein investigation, the FBI said, \"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" The president's demand for an investigation — and Bondi's quick acquiescence — is the latest example of the erosion of the Justice Department's traditional independence from the White House since Trump took office. It is also an extraordinary attempt at deflection. For decades, Trump himself has been scrutinized for his closeness to Epstein — though like the people he now wants investigated, he has not been accused of sexual misconduct by Epstein's victims. None of Trump's proposed targets were accused of sex crimes A JPMorgan Chase spokesperson, Patricia Wexler, said the company regretted associating with Epstein \"but did not help him commit his heinous acts.\" \"The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,\" she said. The company agreed previously to pay millions of dollars to Epstein's victims, who had sued arguing that the bank ignored red flags about criminal activity. Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein's private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. He also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims. Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X Friday: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.\" Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, but was spared a long jail term when the U.S. attorney in Florida agreed not to prosecute him over allegations that he had paid many other children for sexual acts. After serving about a year in jail and a work release program, Epstein resumed his business and social life until federal prosecutors in New York revived the case in 2019. Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Summers and Hoffman had nothing to do with either case, but both were friendly with Epstein and exchanged emails with him. Those messages were among the documents released this week, along with other correspondence Epstein had with friends and business associates in the years before his death. Nothing in the messages suggested any wrongdoing on the men's part, other than associating with someone who had been accused of sex crimes against children. Summers, who served in Clinton's cabinet and is a former Harvard University president, previously said in a statement that he has \"great regrets in my life\" and that \"my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.\" On social media Friday night, Hoffman called for Trump to release all the Epstein files, saying they will show that \"the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander.\" He added, \"I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT.\" Hoffman bankrolled writer E. Jean Carroll's sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit against Trump. After Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in 2019, Hoffman said he'd only had a few interactions with Epstein, all related to his fundraising for MIT's Media Lab. He nevertheless apologized, saying that \"by agreeing to participate in any fundraising activity where Epstein was present, I helped to repair his reputation and perpetuate injustice.\" Bondi, in her post, praised Clayton as \"one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country\" and said the Justice Department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\" Trump called Clayton \"a great man, a great attorney,\" though he said Bondi chose him for the job. Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term, took over in April as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York — the same office that indicted Epstein and won a sex trafficking conviction against Epstein's longtime confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2021. Trump changes course on Epstein files Trump suggested while campaigning last year that he'd seek to open up the government's case files on Epstein, but changed course in recent months, blaming Democrats and painting the matter as a \"hoax\" amid questions about what knowledge he may have had about Epstein's yearslong exploitation of underage girls. On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three Epstein email exchanges that referenced Trump, including one from 2019 in which Epstein said the president \"knew about the girls\" and asked Maxwell to stop. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of having \"selectively leaked emails\" to smear Trump. Soon after, Republicans on the committee disclosed a far bigger trove of Epstein's email correspondence, including messages he sent to longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon and to Britain's former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Andrew settled a lawsuit out of court with one of Epstein's victims, who said she had been paid to have sex with the prince. The House is speeding toward a vote next week to force the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein. \"I don't care about it, release or not,\" Trump said Friday. \"If you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he added, naming Clinton and Hoffman. Still, he said: \"This is a Democrat hoax. And a couple, a few Republicans have gone along with it because they're weak and ineffective.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"Tiny Desk Carousel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts is highlighted on the home page, showcasing musical performances from various artists.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","Music","Live Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607064","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"More liberals, people of color and LGBTQ Americans say they're buying guns out of fear","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores a growing trend in American gun ownership, where more liberals, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals are purchasing guns not for recreation or political activism, but as a form of self-protection due to fear of political violence and civil unrest.

Langfitt \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:30 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When Charles was growing up in the 1970s in Brooklyn, N.Y., his mother was so strict, she forbade toy guns of any kind, including squirt guns. \"I remember vividly, summertime, when my friends would have water gun fights and I couldn't participate,\" he recalls. He grew up and became a doctor, and these days, he heads to a shooting range in Maryland each week for target practice with his Smith & Wesson .380. Charles, who is Black, says he bought the handgun after the Trump administration did things that scared him, including arresting a foreign student who criticized her university's policy on Israel and handcuffing a U.S. senator who was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security news conference. \"What I'm talking about is protecting myself from a situation where there may be some kind of civil unrest,\" says Charles. Like most people who spoke with NPR for this story, he asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. Charles says he worries that some of President Trump's supporters may feel emboldened someday to target minorities like him and his family. \"He could dispatch citizens or the government,\" Charles says. \"I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer.\" Changing face of American gun ownership For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican, but that's been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and academic researchers. They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ folks have been buying guns for years and particularly since Trump's reelection in 2024. This story was based on more than 30 interviews. David Phillips is on the training team of the Liberal Gun Club, which has chapters in more than 30 states and provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. He says club membership has grown from 2,700 in November to 4,500 today. Requests for training, he says, have quintupled. \"The concern is about the supporters of the right-wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like,\" Phillips says. Asked about these concerns, the White House dismissed NPR's reporting. \"Instead of covering Americans exercising their Second Amendment Right and trying to disingenuously blame President Trump, NPR should highlight the dangerous language from elected Democrats that has driven leftists to commit actual violence against Republicans – including the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. Jackson said stories like this one are why NPR no longer receives federal funding. \"That's something we can all celebrate,\" she added. Trump has also blamed what he calls \"the radical left\" for demonizing him and his supporters and inspiring political violence. But many liberals who spoke for this story say it's the other way around. They say the president   dehumanizes others with his rhetoric. For instance, Trump has said undocumented immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" The president has also called his political opponents, \"radical left thugs that live like vermin.\" Despite White House claims to the contrary, there is ample anecdotal evidence that more people are buying guns because some of the administration's policies frighten them. \"Never seen a surge like this before\" \"As everyone knows, there has been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election,\" said Tom Nguyen, speaking on YouTube to his LA Progressive Shooters gun club just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration. Nguyen said the club's Pistol 101 classes were already booked out for nine months. \"I've never seen a surge like this before,\" said Thomas Boyer, spokesperson for the San Francisco Chapter of the Pink Pistols, whose motto is: \"Armed gays don't get bashed.\" Even traditional Second Amendment groups say more liberals are seeking gun training. \"It's definitely common knowledge at this point,\" said Taylor Rhodes, communications director for the National Association for Gun Rights. There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them, but the phrase \"How do I buy a gun?\" spiked a number of times in the past year, according to Google Trends. Those spikes happened around the time of Trump's 2024 election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C. This recent surge in liberals buying guns is the latest in a years-long trend. For instance, a University of Chicago study found that gun ownership by Democrats or Democrat-leaning people rose by 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2022. David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, says the events of 2020 and early 2021 – the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot – were particular drivers. \"We do know that in that year that new gun owners were disproportionately African American (and) disproportionately female,\" Yamane said. Only for self-protection Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would use the weapons only for self-protection and would not engage law enforcement. \"All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone,\" says MJ, a member of a liberal, self-defense group in the Midwest who asked NPR not to use his full name because he feared retribution. \"If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group.\" Bill Sack, director of legal operations with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation, says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their right to self-defense – but he isn't happy about why. \"Is it a good thing that people are scared?\" he says. \"No, of course not.\" Every new gun owner who spoke to NPR said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said that if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun. \"As a man, as a father, as a husband, how remiss and derelict would it be for me to not be prepared?\" says Charles, the Maryland doctor. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican. Well, that has been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and researchers. They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ people have been buying guns for years, especially since last year's election. NPR's Frank Langfitt spoke with some of them to find out why. His story was based on more than 30 interviews. And a warning, it includes the sound of gunfire. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Charles grew up in Brooklyn, New York, in the middle of housing projects. This was back in the '70s. His mother, deeply religious, forbid guns of any kind. CHARLES: So I couldn't even play with a water gun. And I remember vividly summertime when my friends would have water gun fights, and I couldn't participate. LANGFITT: Charles, who's Black, now works as a doctor in Maryland. He comes to this shooting range to practice every week with his new gun. CHARLES: This is a Smith & Wesson .380. And then my next gun will be the Glock, and I already have a shotgun. LANGFITT: Charles said he decided to buy a gun after the Trump administration did things that scared him - the arrest of a foreign student who criticized her university's policy on Israel, the handcuffing of a U.S. senator. Charles worries ordinary citizens like him could eventually be targeted. CHARLES: What I'm talking about is protecting myself from a situation where there may be some kind of chaotic civil unrest and the streets become something we don't recognize. LANGFITT: And that civil unrest that you expect would be triggered by the president or the administration through rhetoric? CHARLES: He has it all. He can dispatch citizens or the government. It doesn't matter. He could do both. And I'm not saying that that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer. LANGFITT: Charles and some others interviewed for this story asked to be identified only by their first names. They fear retaliation from the Trump administration. Charles has a 19-year-old daughter named Charley. She's on the taller side and joins her dad for gun training each week. CHARLEY: I need to practice my headshots. Because of my height, it does make it harder. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) LANGFITT: Charley says she fears for her safety because of her race and gender. The day after the election, a man drove onto her college campus and hurled racial slurs at Black students. CHARLEY: Some people - they hate us so much that they really try to make it known how much we're not wanted here. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) LANGFITT: You mean Black people. CHARLEY: Yes. Especially Black people, women, and also, I feel like who's targeted now is just liberals because of Trump's second term. LANGFITT: White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson dismissed NPR's reporting for this story as, quote, \"disingenuous and biased\" and a reason why the network no longer receives federal funding. President Trump has blamed what he calls the radical left for political violence. He cited his near assassination last year and the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible. For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. LANGFITT: Many liberals who spoke to NPR say it's the president who demonizes others, whether it be undocumented immigrants... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They're poisoning the blood of our country. That's what they've done. LANGFITT: ...Or political opponents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxist, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections and will do anything possible - they'll do anything, whether legally or illegally, to destroy America and to destroy the American dream. DAVID PHILLIPS: I'm David Phillips, and I'm on the training team for The Liberal Gun Club. LANGFITT: The Liberal Gun Club has chapters in more than 30 states. It provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. PHILLIPS: Since the second inauguration of Trump, we have seen an incredible increase in interest in training with firearms. The concern is about the supporters of the right wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod, at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like. LANGFITT: Phillips says club membership has grown by two-thirds since November, from 2,700 members to 4,500. Requests for training have quintupled. Gun clubs with similar membership say they've been seeing the same thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) TOM NGUYEN: Hey folks. As everyone knows, there's been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election, and we've been booked out to September for individuals wanting to take our Pistol 101 class. HOPE: We have seen an increase of membership across our chapters of around 40%. THOMAS BOYER: I've never seen a surge like this before. LANGFITT: That was Tom Nguyen, who runs the LA Progressive Shooters gun club, speaking just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration, followed by a woman named Hope, who helps lead the Socialist Rifle Association, and Thomas Boyer, with the San Francisco chapter of the Pink Pistols. Their motto? Armed gays don't get bashed. Even traditional Second Amendment groups acknowledge more liberals are seeking gun training out of fear. Taylor Rhodes works with the National Association for Gun Rights. TAYLOR RHODES: It's definitely common knowledge at this point. I think we saw a little bit of it, you know, right after the first Trump inauguration. LANGFITT: There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them. But the phrase, how do I buy a gun, spiked a number of times in the last year, according to Google Trends. The spikes came around the time of Trump's election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C. David Yamane is a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University. He says the nation's volatile politics have been driving more liberals and minorities to buy guns for some time. DAVID YAMANE: We definitely saw something similar happening in the COVID year of 2020, where we rolled straight from the pandemic into the summer of the George Floyd murder protests and then rolling straight from there into a contested presidential election. And there we do have some data. We do know that in that year, that new gun owners were disproportionately African American. They were disproportionately female. LANGFITT: Gun ownership among liberals has been on the rise long before Trump's reelection. In 2022, a University of Chicago study found that 29% of Democrats or Democrat-leaning people nationwide had a gun at home. That's seven percentage points higher than a dozen years earlier. Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would only use the weapons for self-protection and would not engage with law enforcement. MJ is a member of a liberal self-defense group in the Midwest. MJ: All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone at all - absolutely not. If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group. LANGFITT: Bill Sack is with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation. He says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their rights to self-defense, but he has a caveat. BILL SACK: Is it a good thing that people are scared? No, of course not. LANGFITT: Every new gun owner NPR interviewed for this story said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said, if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun. Frank Langfitt, NPR News.

The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 9:22 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue, resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,\" Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, \"I say they may, in some cases\" have that effect. \"But to a large extent they've been borne by other countries,\" the president added. Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump's pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated, further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren't a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday's move as an acknowledgement that Trump's policies were hurting American pocketbooks. \"President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,\" Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. \"After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters' fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a 'pivot to affordability.'\" Grocery bill worries Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don't increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, had been a factor. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren't produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump's move to provide \"swift tariff relief,\" noting that import U.S. taxes \"are an important factor\" in a \"complex mix\" of supply chain issues. \"President Trump's proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,\" the association said in a statement. In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he'd since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Indeed, Friday's announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. \"Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,\" the president said then. \"We're going to have some coffee come in.\" Tariff checks? Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, \"Sometime during the year.\" Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. \"This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,\" Trump said. \"Everybody but the rich will get this. That's not made up. That's real money. That comes from other countries.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97864","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00-05:00","title":"Judge says he'll approve opioid settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue and Sackler family","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal bankruptcy court judge, Sean Lane, has approved a $7 billion settlement between Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family over their role in the opioid crisis, replacing a prior deal rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.

2025 • 3:13 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NEW YORK — A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma's latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic. The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years. The new agreement replaces one the U.S. Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including from heroin and illicit fentanyl. Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars. Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could \"conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.\" But without that possibility, he said: \"The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.\" The opposition is much quieter this time around The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote. Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse. A handful of objectors spoke during the three-day hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing. A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough. \"The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\" Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video. Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago. Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There's no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven't had a say. Besides contributing cash, members of the Sackler family would formally give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing. The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026. Family members would be barred from involvement in companies that sell opioids anywhere in the world. And they would not have their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities. Company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public. Some people hurt by Purdue's opioids would receive some money Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal. All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive. One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder. \"Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,\" asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York. Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. \"Some Sacklers are bad people,\" he said, \"but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.\" Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5608107","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-05:00","title":"Sirāt is a desert survival story — and one of the year's most gripping films","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The film 'Sirāt', directed by Oliver Laxe, is a gripping survival story set in the Sahara Desert following a man named Luis, played by Sergi López, as he searches for his missing daughter Mar among a group of nomadic European ravers in southern Morocco after a global crisis such as World War III.

         Friday, November 14, 2025 • 11:25 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Fresh Air \n        \n      \n\n         The Arabic word  sirāt  means \"path\" or \"way\"; in Islamic scripture, it refers to a narrow bridge that connects Paradise and Hell. That makes it a fitting title for the director Oliver Laxe's new movie, which is both exhilarating and devastating.  Sirāt  is a survival story about several unlikely traveling companions making their way through a godforsaken stretch of the Sahara Desert. It carries echoes of countless earlier films, from the arid landscapes of a John Ford Western to the post-apocalyptic setting of  Mad Max . But nothing about  Sirāt  feels derivative or secondhand. It's an astonishing piece of cinema; I haven't had a more gripping experience in a movie theater all year. It begins somewhere in southern Morocco, where hundreds of nomadic European revelers have gathered for a rave. It seems that World War III or something like it has broken out, though the specifics are left vague. Whatever's going on,  Sirāt  initially plays like a party at the end of the world: Imagine a remake of the recent dystopian thriller  Civil War  set at  Burning Man , and you'll have some idea. Laxe, a French-born, Spanish director, sweeps you up in the intense physicality of the dancing and the propulsive beat of the music, composed by the experimental electronic musician Kangding Ray. Wandering around this unruly desert bacchanal is a middle-aged man named Luis, played by the Spanish actor Sergi López. This clearly isn't Luis' scene. Along with his young son Esteban and their dog, Luis is searching for his 20-something daughter, Mar, who vanished months ago, and whom he has reason to suspect is among the ravers.  But she's nowhere to be found, and before long, armed officials show up and, invoking a state of emergency, break up the party. Amid the ensuing chaos, five ravers drive off, bound for another rave further south.

Our film critic, Justin Chang, says that \"Sirat\" is the best new movie he's seen this year. It's about a man searching for his lost daughter at a rave in the desert of southern Morocco. \"Sirat\" won a jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year and will represent Spain in the Oscar race for Best International Feature. Here is Justin's review. JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: The Arabic word sirat means path or way. In Islamic scripture, it refers to a narrow bridge that connects paradise and hell. That makes it a fitting title for the director Oliver Laxe's new movie, which is both exhilarating and devastating. It's a survival story about several unlikely traveling companions making their way through a good forsaken stretch of the Sahara desert. It carries echoes of countless earlier films from the arid landscapes of a John Ford Western to the postapocalyptic setting of \"Mad Max.\" But nothing about \"Sirat\" feels derivative or secondhand. It's an astonishing piece of cinema. I haven't had a more gripping experience in a movie theater all year. It begins somewhere in southern Morocco, where hundreds of nomadic European revelers have gathered for a rave. It seems that World War III or something like it has broken out, though the specifics are left vague. Whatever's going on, \"Sirat\" initially plays like a party at the end of the world. Imagine a remake of the recent dystopian thriller \"Civil War\" set at Burning Man and you'll have some idea. Laxe sweeps you up in the intense physicality of the dancing and the propulsive beat of the music, composed by the experimental electronic musician Kangding Ray. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SIRAT\") CHANG: Wandering around this unruly desert bacchanal is a middle-aged man named Luis, played by the Spanish actor Sergi Lopez. This clearly isn't Luis' scene. Along with his young son, Esteban, and their dog, Luis is searching for his 20-something daughter, Mar, who vanished months ago and whom he has reason to suspect is among the ravers. But she's nowhere to be found. And before long, armed officials show up, and invoking a state of emergency, break up the party. Amid the ensuing chaos, five ravers drive off, bound for another rave further south. Luis and Esteban impulsively drive after them, hoping against hope that they'll find Mar. In Laxe's previous films, including the 2016 drama \"Mimosas,\" which also chronicled a perilous journey through Morocco, he has worked mainly with nonprofessional actors. With the exception of Sergi Lopez, that's also true here. The director recruited most of the principal cast from raves that he himself attended, and they're all naturals. I especially like Stefania Gadda as a woman of few words but immense screen presence, and Jade Oukid as a dancer of mesmerizing ability. You feel for these off-the-grid daredevils, and you admire their survival tactics during what will prove to be an exceedingly dangerous trek. While the ravers have an enormous truck and a camper van, Luis and Esteban are in a small van that's ill-equipped for the treacherous terrain. But the ravers, somewhat reluctantly at first, let them tag along. They all share their limited resources, including food, water and gas. And they help each other out when Luis has trouble fording a small river, or when the truck gets stuck on a steep mountain road. \"Sirat\" is a visually and sonically overwhelming experience. It's full of majestic desert vistas and propelled by that thrillingly percussive score. It's also a drama of extraordinary tension, and eventually, shocking tragedy, in which death has a way of striking when you least expect it. I was often reminded of \"The Wages Of Fear\" and \"Sorcerer,\" two classic nail-biters, both adapted from a Georges Arnaud novel about a road trip from hell. What separates \"Sirat\" from those two films, though, is its lack of cynicism. Lopez is terrific as a father whose child has disappeared and who's understandably wary and mistrustful of the world. But even at his bleakest moments, Luis receives unexpected acts of compassion from his new companions. At one point, Esteban asks one of the ravers if he misses his family while traveling on the road. And the raver responds, I prefer this family. That might sound like something Vin Diesel would say in a \"Fast & Furious\" movie, and as it happens, Diesel's driving skills might've come in handy here. But Laxe's film is as sincere in its tenderness as it is unrelenting in its ferocity. There's something powerful about the movie's belief that even as an apocalypse looms, kindness can survive and meaningful relationships can form. Just because the world is pitiless, \"Sirat\" suggests, doesn't mean that people have to be. BIANCULLI: Justin Chang is a film critic at The New Yorker. He reviewed \"Sirat,\" now playing in select theaters. On Monday's show, actress and singer Cynthia Erivo. She returns on screen as Elphaba in \"Wicked: For Good,\" who claims her own power even as the world deems her the wicked witch. In Erivo's new memoir, \"Simply More,\" she explores similar themes, shedding other people's definitions of who she should be as a woman and an artist. I hope you can join us. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEFYING GRAVITY\") CYNTHIA ERIVO: (Singing) Something has changed within me. Something is not the same. I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game. Too late for second-guessing. Too late to go back to sleep. It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap. It's time to try defying gravity. I think I'll try defying gravity, and you can't pull me down. BIANCULLI: To keep up with what's on the show and get highlights of our interviews, follow us on Instagram at @nprfresh Air.

They broke records \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 11:32 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The first of 30 Bob Ross paintings — many of them created live on the PBS series that made him a household name — have been auctioned off to support public television. Ross, with his distinctive afro, soothing voice and sunny outlook, empowered millions of viewers to make and appreciate art through his show  The Joy of Painting . More than 400 half-hour episodes aired on PBS (and eventually the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) from 1983 to 1994, the year before Ross died of cancer at age 52. Ross' impact lives on: His show still airs on PBS and streams on platforms like Hulu  and Twitch . It has  surged in popularity  in recent years, particularly as viewers searched for comfort during COVID-19 lockdowns. Certified instructors continue teaching his wet-on-wet oil painting  technique to the masses , and the  Smithsonian acquired  several of his works for its permanent collection in 2019. But his artwork rarely goes up for sale — until recently.  In October, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) announced it would auction off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. It pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide. Auction house Bonhams is calling it the  \"largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market.\" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting and some activists have  even invoked him  in their calls for restoring federal funding to it. \"It's a medium that Bob just cherished,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc., in a phone call with NPR. \"With the cuts, it's just a natural inclination to support public television.\" The first three paintings sold in Los Angeles  on Nov. 11 . for a record-shattering $662,000. Bonhams says the works attracted hundreds of registrations, more than twice the usual number for that type of sale. Each sold for more than its estimated worth, led by  Winter's Peace,  which fetched $318,000 to set a new Ross auction record.  \"As anticipated, these paintings inspired spirited bidding, achieved impressive results and broke global auction records, continuing the momentum we've seen building in [Ross'] market,\" said Robin Starr, the general manager of Bonhams Skinner, the auction house's Massachusetts branch. \"These successes provide a solid foundation as we look ahead to 2026 and prepare to present the next group of Bob Ross works.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The next trio of paintings will be auctioned in Massachusetts in late January. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston. How the offering could benefit public broadcasters  At President Trump's direction, Congress voted in July to  claw back $1.1 billion  in previously allocated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), leaving the country's roughly 330 PBS and 244 NPR stations in a precarious position. CPB began  shutting down  at the end of September, PBS has  already cut 15%  of its jobs, and several local TV and  radio stations  have also announced layoffs and closures. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think he would be very disappointed\" about the CPB cuts, Kowalski said of Ross. \"I think he would have decided to do exactly what we're doing right now ... I think this would have probably been his idea.\" Kowalski, whose parents founded Bob Ross Inc. together with the painter in 1985, said Ross favored positive activism over destructive or empty rhetoric. \"That just was his nature,\" she said. \"He was like that in real life. So I think this would have been exactly the thing that he would have chosen. I suddenly got really emotional thinking about that.\" The Ross auction aims to help stations pay their licensing fees to the  national TV channel Create , which in turn allows them to air popular public television programs including  The Best of the Joy of Painting  (based on Ross' show),  America's Test Kitchen, Rick Steve's Europe and  Julia Child's  French Chef Classics . Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them. \"This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts,\" the auction house says. Ross' paintings rarely hit the market The 30 paintings going up for sale span Ross' career and are all \"previously unseen by the public except during their creation in individual episodes\" of  The Joy of Painting,  according to Bonhams. Many have remained in secure storage ever since. They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and \"happy trees\" that became his trademark. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,  he later said , his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service. Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just \"happy accidents,\" talent is a \"pursued interest,\" and it's important to \"take a step back and look.\" \"Ross' gentle teaching style and positive philosophy made him a cultural icon whose influence extends far beyond the art world,\" Bonhams says. While Ross was prolific, his paintings were intended for teaching instead of selling, and therefore rarely go on the market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In August, Bonhams sold two of Ross' early 1990s mountain and lake scenes as part of an online auction of American art. They fetched $114,800 and $95,750, surpassing expectations and setting a new auction world record for Ross at the time. Kowalski says that's when her gears started turning.  \"And it just got me to thinking, that's a substantial amount of money,\" she recalled. \"And what if, what if, what if?\"  Bonhams officially estimates that the 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million. But Starr, of the auction house, predicted in October that they will continue to exceed expectations, based on their artistic value, nostalgia factor and more.  \"Now we add in the fact that these are selling to benefit public television, I think the bidding is going to be very happy,\" she said. \"Happy trees, happy bidding.\"  Disclosure: This story was edited by general assignment editor Carol Ritchie and managing editor Vickie Walton-James. Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no NPR corporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted publicly. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   Public broadcasting helped make artist Bob Ross a household name. Now the late painter's company wants to give back. It is auctioning off dozens of his original works - many of them painted live on a show - to support public TV after federal funding cuts. NPR's Rachel Treisman reports. RACHEL TREISMAN, BYLINE: Bob Ross brought his soothing voice, sunny outlook and trademark afro to over 400 episodes of \"The Joy Of Painting,\" which aired on PBS between 1983 and his death in 1995. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") BOB ROSS: We don't make mistakes, you know. We have happy accidents. TREISMAN: Decades later, viewers are streaming it online and still watching it on public TV. It's a medium that Ross cherished, says Joan Kowalski, the president of Bob Ross, Inc. JOAN KOWALSKI: He used to talk about that a lot. He felt like he was in someone's living room and it was just that one person. TREISMAN: At the direction of President Trump, Congress voted in July to claw back over $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, slashing funding for PBS and NPR stations across the country. The next month, the auction house Bonhams sold two Bob Ross paintings for over $200,000 combined, exceeding their estimated value to set a new record. KOWALSKI: And it just got me to thinking, you know, that's a substantial amount of money, and what if? What if? What if? TREISMAN: Kowalski, along with Bonhams and American Public Television, came up with a plan. They will auction off 30 of Ross' original paintings, with all net proceeds going to APT and PBS stations nationwide. They hope the money raised will help stations pay the licensing fees to air popular programs like \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Rick Steves' Europe\" and \"The Best Of The Joy Of Painting.\" Kowalski says if Ross were alive today... KOWALSKI: I think this would've probably been his idea. TREISMAN: It's rare for Ross' paintings to make it out of storage and onto the market. He painted most of these 30 works on TV, while some are from his instructional books. They won't all be sold at once. The first three paintings are going up for auction in Los Angeles in November. Here's Robin Starr, the general manager of the auction house's Massachusetts branch. ROBIN STARR: Throughout the next year or so, we will be metering out the other 27 works, and those will be coming up out of our California, New York and Massachusetts galleries. TREISMAN: Many are Ross' trademark landscapes, with vibrant mountains, lake views, lush forests, and his signature happy little trees. Here he is working on \"Home In The Valley,\" a 1993 painting that will be up for auction in November. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") ROSS: It's very simple, and it will teach you how to use all the equipment. And it's a lot of fun. TREISMAN: The auction house estimates the paintings could bring in up to $1.4 million, but organizers are hoping they will once again exceed expectations. As Starr said, happy trees, happy bidding. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE JOY OF PAINTING\") ROSS: And with the old signature on here, I think we're going to call that one finished. TREISMAN: Rachel Treisman, NPR News.

Running Man,' a new 'Now You See Me,' and George Clooney are in theaters \n         By Bob Mondello, Linda Holmes \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 11:38 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         There's yet another  Now You See Me  in theaters this weekend, along with yet another Stephen King adaptation. George Clooney plays a charming Hollywood star in Jay Kelly, while a warm, funny and goosebump-raising documentary streams on Apple TV. Here's what to watch. Now You See Me, Now You Don't In theaters Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The cast keeps expanding in this magic-centric rob-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor heist franchise, as if the writers saw  Ocean's Eleven  through  Thirteen  and thought, \"we could do that.\" New kids Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt join original Horsemen (and hangers-on) Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and Isla Fisher in pursuit of a priceless diamond held by a money-laundering arms dealer (Rosamund Pike). That fits the aesthetic of the first two  Now You See Me' s (shouldn't this one really be called  Now You Three Me ?) — but where the earlier films seemed to want you to believe the on-screen magicians were pulling off their tricks, this one mostly settles for CGI and cinematic trickery, so that even card tricks fall slightly flat. Eisenberg's prickly snark is still fun, but with the tricks getting less convincing and the scripts more exhausting, it might be time for this franchise to go up in a puff of smoke.  — Bob Mondello  The Running Man  In theaters Friday  This trailer includes instances of vulgar language.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       One tricky thing about writing dystopian fiction with staying power is that the future eventually catches up with you. Stephen King's 1982 novel  The Running Man  takes place in 2025. In his vision of, well, now, there is widespread poverty, rule by giant corporations, and exploitative entertainment that takes advantage of people who are suffering and tries to force ordinary people to despise each other. There is environmental destruction, mass surveillance, and even the resurgence of polio. Just imagine. The story follows a man named Ben Richards, who tries to provide for his family and his sick kid by going on a game show also called  The Running Man . On the show, he has to survive on the streets for 30 days while professional assassins pursue him. If he makes it, he wins a billion dollars. But, of course, nobody has ever survived. In the new adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright, Richards (played by Glen Powell) auditions for the game shows run by the megacorporation known as The Network because his daughter has the flu, and Richards and his wife can't afford a doctor for her without a big prize. The biggest problem with this adaptation is that if you read the book, you probably know there are a couple of things about the ending that a major studio movie released in 2025 is unlikely to replicate. As an action movie that hits the gas, gets the running man running, and doesn't let up, it works quite well, and it's a lot of fun. But some of King's sharper-elbowed commentary about what it might take to escape this kind of oppressive society is blunted a bit, making it a less effective critique of its world than the book was.  — Linda Holmes  Jay Kelly In limited theaters Friday; on Netflix Dec. 5 \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Hollywood star Jay Kelly — handsome, affable, debonaire, sixty-something … in short, George Clooney — reconsiders his life choices on a trip to Tuscany in Noah Baumbach's bland mid-life crisis dramedy. Estranged from one daughter (Riley Keough), and distressed by the growing distance of another (Grace Edwards) who's off on a trip to Europe before college, he's feeling alone in a crowd of paid companions, including his faithful manager (Adam Sandler, excellent) and publicist (Laura Dern, whose talents are mostly wasted). After a public altercation with a college buddy, he opts to avoid the PR blowup and possibly find some catch-up time with his daughter by taking an impromptu trip to Italy for a career tribute he'd previously turned down.  Minor misadventures ensue — a train trip punctuated by a purse snatching incident, a reunion with his coarse dad (Stacy Keach), a fight with his increasingly put-upon manager. Not sure I was feeling anyone's pain about the loneliness of stardom, the heartbreak of success, the … whatever the hell else this was about. Baumbach has wandered into the territory of  8½  and  Stardust Memories  and he gets a bit lost in the woods, but Clooney's magnetism goes a decent way to making things palatable, the cinematography is pretty and Sandler dominates whenever he's on screen.  — Bob Mondello  The Things You Kill In limited theaters Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Iranian-Canadian director Alireza Khatami's Turkish-language thriller follows Ali, a university professor, as his life unravels. His mother's sick, his father's a bully, his wife wants a child (he hasn't told her his sperm count is low), and his only safe place is an arid farm (\"garden\") to which he retreats whenever possible. The arrival of Reza, a stranger who is game to do the things Ali won't (bribe bureaucrats to deepen his well, maybe even kill his father) complicates things, and also, in a sense, solves them. The filmmaker's first name provides a not-insignificant clue as to what's going on, as his filmmaking deconstructs the story and his protagonist in initially confusing, and then riveting ways.  — Bob Mondello Come See Me In the Good Light Streaming on Apple TV starting Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       There's no way to make this documentary sound like the upbeat, rousing and often downright hilarious romp it is, but here goes: At the urging of comedian Tig Notaro, poet and spoken-word star Andrea Gibson and life partner and fellow poet Megan Falley invited filmmaker Ryan White and his crew into their home in 2021. It was mid-pandemic, and the crew was allowed full access to the couple's every thought and action as they dealt with turtledove love, mailbox madness, and – here's the part where you say, \"no, this does not sound like a good time\" — Gibson's Stage 4 ovarian cancer journey. At the Middleburg Film Festival screening I attended in October — three months after Gibson's death — the director spoke beforehand, giving the audience \"permission to laugh,\" which it definitely did. It also sniffled a bit, but less than you might expect, because Gibson's vibrant, assertively affirmative outlook doesn't really brook tears, and the filmmaker's warmth and humor, even in times of despair, gives the story a radiance that makes mundane moments feel precious, while allowing hopeful moments to raise goosebumps.  — Bob Mondello  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598308","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00-11:00","title":"This week brings new books grappling with the endings of relationships and eras","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This week's new books explore the theme of endings—personal, cultural, or historical—highlighting the emotional and narrative weight of transitions in relationships, aging, and societal shifts.

relationships and eras \n         By Colin Dwyer \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 10:40 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It feels fitting, in a way, that so many notable books this week are premised on endings — of lives, relationships, eras, even. After all, Armistice Day, or Remembrance Day — also known as Veterans Day in the U.S. – is Tuesday. The day annually  marks the end  of one of history's most catastrophic conflicts, World War I. For the most part, the endings that animate many of this week's new novels don't seek such world-historical consequence. Ann Packer, Quiara Alegria Hudes and the other authors who grace the list below are concerned with much more intimate details, the kind you're more likely to encounter just down the street than on a battlefield or at an international summit. That said, the twisty history of currency — the subject of this week's one nonfiction entry in the roundup — reinforces a lesson learned with the peace of 1918: Beware of endings; they have the odd habit of being yet another beginning in disguise. Some Bright Nowhere , by Ann Packer Ann Packer's first novel in a decade finds the American author again pursuing a deceptively simple premise: A long-married couple must prepare for and confront their final weeks together before death comes for one of them. But don't be fooled by the saccharine-sounding summary. As  Fresh Air 's Maureen Corrigan explained in  a review of Packer's previous novel ,  The Children's Crusade , the author has a knack for turning what might have been \"mundane mass-market fiction\" into a rich, splintered narrative that \"illuminate[s] the unexpected depths of the commonplace.\" The White Hot , by Quiara Alegria Hudes It's possible you've already encountered Hudes' writing without knowing it. Though her name is new to the adult fiction shelf, the veteran playwright penned the book for the Tony-winning musical  In the Heights ,  wrote the screenplay  for  its 2021 film adaptation  and won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for  her play  Water by the Spoonful , about the return of an Iraq war veteran. In  The White Hot ,  she explores a departure , in the voice of a young mother who tries to understand and explain her decision to leave her family for the freedom of a one-way ticket far, far away. The Silver Book , by Olivia Laing Laing's writing roams a Venn diagram of memoir, art criticism, history and fiction, rarely pursuing just one genre without including at least some elements of the others. Her memoir  The Lonely City , for instance, wove the stuff of academic journals into a  chronicle of her life in New York City . Her only previous novel,  Crudo , dressed up in the persona of author Kathy Acker for an exercise that NPR's reviewer admiringly called a \"memoir in drag.\" For its part,  The Silver Book , though a novel, sets its inventions in an especially consequential – and controversial – era of Italian cinema: the final year or two before the brutal, unsolved murder of director Pier Paolo Pasolini. Evensong , by Stewart O'Nan O'Nan's latest novel finds the \"oracle of the ordinary and maven of the middle class\" — as NPR reviewer Heller McAlpin  described the novelist in 2012  — once again mining the mundane for its hidden magic. In  Evensong , the cult favorite centers a small, lovingly rendered group of older women as they navigate the peculiar challenges of growing older, together as friends. The History of Money: A Story of Humanity , by David McWilliams McWilliams is an Irish economist,  podcaster  and founder of a festival that  pairs world economics with standup comedy . Promoting the festival back in 2010, McWilliams  explained to NPR  why he orients his work more toward the hoi polloi than the ivory tower: \"If you think that knowledge is power, well, then giving people the knowledge, packaging the knowledge in such a way that the knowledge becomes accessible — that empowers the people.\" That rings true in this lively, lightfooted life story of currency, which cares less for comprehensiveness than keeping the door open for experts and novices alike. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5553561","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"12:58:00-05:00","title":"The Trump Administration Plans Major Shift Away from Long-Term Housing for Homelessness","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is shifting federal homelessness funding away from long-term 'Housing First' permanent housing programs toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment.

homelessness \n         By Jennifer Ludden \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 14, 2025 • 12:58 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is upending its homelessness policy, with deep cuts to funding for long-term housing. Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said  the new policies  will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing  Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that. In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups. The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled. \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement. The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments. \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement. The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets. But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels. Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an  executive order he signed in July , which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction. \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer. \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own. There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help. \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles. For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   In a major shift, the Trump administration is moving away from long-term housing for homelessness. Instead, it will ramp up funding for transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. Critics warn that this could push many people back on the streets. NPR's Jennifer Ludden has been covering this and joins us now. Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: OK, so we have been hearing President Trump weigh in a lot on homelessness this year. Can you just tell us more about what this change would mean exactly? LUDDEN: Yeah, this does reflect an executive order President Trump signed this summer, but it goes a lot further. It's about a dramatic shift in how to spend nearly $4 billion in homelessness funding. That's an overall amount that is up from last year. The federal housing agency HUD says the idea is to promote self-sufficiency and get at root causes of homelessness, which it says are specifically addiction and mental illness, very common among those living outside. Now, the changes are a rebuke to longstanding federal policy. It's called Housing First. And under that, the vast majority of this funding has long gone to permanent housing that offers people treatment, but it doesn't require it. There's been a real backlash building as homelessness has spiked to record highs, according to annual federal accounts. I spoke with Stephen Eide who's with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. He's argued for a long time that these permanent housing projects are not the answer. STEPHEN EIDE: It turned out that the units were so expensive. They cost hundreds of thousands of dollars individually, and they took years and years to bring online. And so it was just oversold. LUDDEN: Now, Eide says with this change, it will be quicker and cheaper to ramp up shorter-term transitional housing, and that with mandated treatment, many could become self-sufficient. CHANG: But this is a pretty major overhaul, right? Like, what do advocacy groups who work on homelessness say about this idea? LUDDEN: They largely do not agree at all. I spoke with Ann Oliva. She heads the National Alliance to End Homelessness, and she used to manage HUD's homelessness programs. She says people in the agency's permanent housing need that help, and they need it long term. And her group and others calculate that shifting most money away from these kind of programs could lead as many as 170,000 people to lose housing all over again. ANN OLIVA: Those are people who have overcome homelessness, people who are seniors, who have disabling conditions. It's going to disadvantage those folks, but it also disadvantages communities really significantly because they are being expected to make massive, massive changes in a very short period of time. LUDDEN: And what she means there is these changes are part of a notice to apply for funding, and it's coming much later in the year than usual. Now, some programs are actually slated to run out of money before this new funding would start up. CHANG: Whoa. OK, so then what happens next at this point? LUDDEN: I think next, it is a big scramble, you know, for applying for this funding and also figuring out who can apply to these new qualifications. Advocates say you can't just easily switch from Housing First to transitional, and in many cases, that's just not realistic. Also, the agency will now favor places and programs that comply with the Trump administration's policy agenda, like the president's rollback of DEI and push for homeless camping bans. And finally, in the past, a lot of this funding has basically rolled over to existing projects. But now HUD says only 30% of grants will be automatically renewed. It wants the process to be more competitive with new players at the table. So that's another way that programs who are now housing formerly homeless people could suddenly lose their funding in coming months. CHANG: That is NPR's Jennifer Ludden. Thank you, Jennifer. LUDDEN: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604280","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"It's 2025, and the future has finally caught up with Stephen King's 'Running Man'","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 film adaptation of Stephen King's 1982 novel 'The Running Man,' directed by Edgar Wright, brings a gritty, action-driven reimagining of a dystopian future set in 2025.

7:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         One tricky thing about writing dystopian fiction with staying power is that the future eventually catches up with you. Stephen King's 1982 novel  The Running Man  takes place in 2025. In his vision of, well, now, there is widespread poverty, rule by giant corporations, and exploitative entertainment that takes advantage of people who are suffering and tries to force ordinary people to despise each other. There is environmental destruction, mass surveillance and even the resurgence of polio. Just imagine. The story follows a man named Ben Richards, who tries to provide for his family and his sick kid by going on a game show also called  The Running Man . On the show, he has to survive on the streets for 30 days while professional assassins pursue him. If he makes it, he wins a billion dollars. But, of course, nobody has ever survived. In 1987, a loose film adaptation starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cop falsely accused of murder and forced into the race as punishment. It turned the story into a campy, flashy action picture where Richards fought cartoonish villains and had to survive a three-hour arena battle rather than a 30-day dash through the real world. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The new adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright, returns to the grimmer original story. Richards (played by Glen Powell) auditions for the game show run by the megacorporation known as The Network because his daughter has the flu, and Richards and his wife can't afford a doctor for her without a big prize. Dan Killian (Josh Brolin), the executive who oversees the game show empire, thinks Ben's anger and physical skill make him a perfect fit for  The Running Man . And so Richards takes off, trying to stay ahead of the Hunters, the show's regulars who pursue and kill contestants. The chief Hunter is a celebrity named McCone (Lee Pace), who, despite being hailed as a hero by the Network and cheered by the show's bloodthirsty audience, wears a mask over his head to conceal his identity, which seems like good evidence of how thin, he knows, the line can be between being cheered and, should the wind shift, being loathed. The strongest parts of the movie are the parts when the running man, you know, runs. Wright, who directed  Shaun of the Dead  and  Hot Fuzz  as well as  Baby Driver  and  Scott Pilgrim vs. The World , has a good feel for offbeat action, including, here, a great confrontation inside a cheap hotel (in the book it's a YMCA) and a car chase cleverly filmed mostly from Richards' perspective inside the trunk, so that the audience feels the chaos and hears the noise in a way that feels fresher than just another medley of screeching tires and fishtailing back ends. Powell plays very well with the supporting cast, particularly Michael Cera (who goes back with Wright at least as far as  Scott Pilgrim ). Cera plays an ally who despises both the larger system and the local police. Also making a nice showing is Daniel Ezra, who ends up being invested in  The Running Man  game show in a clever update for the internet age. King didn't include the online universe in 1982, of course, but I think he certainly would have if he'd known, so it's a good addition. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The biggest problem with this adaptation is that if you read the book, you probably know there are a couple of things about the ending that a major studio movie released in 2025 is unlikely to replicate. There are visuals that aren't going to happen on-screen given real-life historical events that have intervened since the publication of the novel, and there are things Stephen King will do as a storyteller that Paramount Pictures will not do as a studio. So there were always going to be some changes. Wright does a good job of navigating that as well as he can and staying much, much closer to the original than the silly Schwarzenegger version. Inevitably, though, when there's a different feel to the ending of this movie, that gives a similarly different feel to the whole story. Some of King's sharper-elbowed commentary about what it might take to escape this kind of oppressive society is blunted a bit. Ultimately, the film has to stand on its own, and it takes opportunities to play up the action that are harder in print. But it's a less effective critique of its world than the book was. With all that said, as an action movie that hits the gas, gets the running man running, and doesn't let up, it works quite well, and it's a lot of fun. Colman Domingo, who has played a lot of very noble characters in the last few years, sinks his teeth deliciously into the role of the flashy host who hypes up the mobs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       They bring the whole thing in at a little over two hours, provided you don't hang around to watch all the credits, and that's a good thing in a world of action bloat. Mileage may vary depending on how you react to Powell: His not-totally-trustworthy slickness fit perfectly into the worlds of  Hit Man  and  Twisters , and it's a slightly different fit for this. He's not a Schwarzenegger type, despite having a genuinely massive upper body here (which gets a mention only because they make sure you get many chances to admire it). He's always got a bit of a wink to him, and some of his best work in this film are the moments when there's some comedy working alongside the action. The final act doesn't feel as sharply focused as the rest (which is true of the book, also), but if you like your dystopias with a dose of high octane, you'll probably have a very good time.

By Willem Marx \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 6:41 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         LONDON — Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, has issued a personal apology to President Trump over a misleading edit of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech in a documentary broadcast on its  Panorama  series. But the BBC has firmly rejected a demand from Trump's legal team for compensation. His personal attorneys  threatened a $1 billion defamation lawsuit  unless the BBC retracts the program, apologizes and pays for causing him to \"suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a letter to the White House released late Thursday, BBC Chair Samir Shah said he and the corporation were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech,\" acknowledging that the way the footage was spliced created \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" But despite the apology, the letter made clear it does not concede the defamation claim. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the corporation said.  The documentary — titled  Trump: A Second Chance?  — was commissioned by the BBC from an external production company and aired shortly before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together separate parts of Trump's speech on the day of the Capitol riots, even though the excerpts came from moments almost an hour apart. Critics argued that the edit misrepresented the president's words, especially by omitting a section where he had called for peaceful protest.  Swift, public consequences In its retraction, the BBC accepted that the editing \"unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech … and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" The broadcaster also announced it had no plans to rebroadcast the episode. The legal threat from an incumbent U.S. president has triggered serious fallout at the BBC. Director-General Tim Davie and CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness both  resigned in the wake of the controversy . In a message to staff, Davie admitted \"we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach,\" but also urged them to defend the BBC's journalism under growing pressure. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The British government has also been drawn into the debate. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy defended the broadcaster in Parliament this week, highlighting its importance at a time of political polarization and widespread misinformation.  \"It is by far the most widely used and trusted source of news in the United Kingdom,\" she told fellow lawmakers. \"At a time when the lines are being dangerously blurred between fact and opinion, news and polemic, the BBC stands apart.\" A legally complex case The president's lawyers have threatened to file suit in Florida, but legal experts note that it could be difficult for Trump to argue reputational damage in the U.S. since the documentary did not air in the country widely, so it may be challenging to prove Americans watched and were influenced by the film. Still, the dispute has stirred a broader debate about the BBC's role and accountability.  Critics fear that, if forced to pay out, the BBC could be using public funds to settle with a foreign head of state.  For many in the United Kingdom, this touches on national pride and the public broadcaster's mission to inform and educate, not to be dragged into costly legal battles. If the case proceeds, it could cost millions in legal fees, even if the BBC ultimately wins, and media lawyers say the public nature of pretrial disclosures could have a huge cost to the broadcaster's reputation. Opposition from the British public Established over a century ago and operating under a Royal Charter, the BBC is funded almost entirely through a TV license fee that is paid by most U.K. households.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Its reporting has shaped the national understanding and perception of wars, elections, royal events and major cultural moments, meaning the lawsuit has touched a cultural nerve for many Britons.  That was sharply articulated during a BBC radio phone-in earlier this week.  One caller,  identifying himself only as Simon  from the southwest town of Truro, warned he would not support public funds reimbursing the former U.S. president.  \"If we have to pay a penny to Trump, then I'm sorry — I'm not going to pay my TV license,\" he said. \"The world just seems to be frightened of him.

Martinson also says Trump's latest threat repeated a pattern of trying to exploit existing dissatisfaction — in this case that stems from the BBC's coverage of other issues, like Gaza, gender rights and British politics.  \"It's about sowing dissent on the very nature of accuracy and impartiality.\" A broadcasting giant Stewart Purvis, a former CEO of major news network ITN and once an official at the U.K.'s media regulator, said the BBC plays a role unmatched elsewhere.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The BBC is the most consumed broadcast media outlet in the U.K. It's almost like combining two or even three of the American networks,\" Purvis told NPR.  \"You know, everybody loves the BBC in some way, but everyone has something to complain about, about the BBC.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The BBC - the British Broadcasting Corporation - apologized to President Trump for a documentary about the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to walk down to the Capitol. MARX: For juxtaposing in a documentary two separate parts of a speech Trump made on January 6. The broadcasters acknowledged the editing was misleading. Trump's ultimatum, though, touched a national nerve for some, including a BBC radio guest called Simon (ph), who gave just his first name. SIMON: If we have to pay a penny to Trump, then I'm sorry, I'm not going to pay my TV license. The world just seems to be frightened of him. I think the BBC needs to stand up to him. MARX: Media commentators like Jane Martinson, a journalism professor at London's City University, says this case is not just about impartial reporting but also national pride. JANE MARTINSON: The idea that an American president would sue the British broadcaster paid for by British taxpayers is pretty astonishing. MARX: For despite its global reach, the BBC remains deeply British and loved, says Stewart Purvis, the former CEO of the BBC's biggest rival. STEWART PURVIS: It's almost like combining one or two or even three of the American networks. Everybody loves the BBC in some way, but everyone has something to complain about about the BBC. MARX: Government minister Lisa Nandy told Parliament this week it plays a crucial role in the country's cultural and democratic life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LISA NANDY: At a time when the lines are being dangerously blurred between fact and opinion, news and polemic, the BBC stands apart.

thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic. The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years. The new agreement replaces one the U.S. Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday. It’s among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers , wholesalers and pharmacies . It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including from heroin and illicit fentanyl. Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could “conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.” But without that possibility, he said: “The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.” Advocates for opioid victims gather around a banner made by artist Fernando Luis Alvarez during a protest outside the Department of Justice, Dec. 3, 2021, in Washington.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The opposition is much quieter this time around The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court , often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement , entities who don’t opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits. This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there’s been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn’t vote. Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse. A handful of objectors spoke during the three-day hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn’t bar prosecutors from pursuing. A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn’t enough. “The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.

Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis . There’s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective . Those hit the hardest generally haven’t had a say . Besides contributing cash, members of the Sackler family would formally give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago , none were called to testify in this week’s hearing. The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026. Family members would be barred from involvement in companies that sell opioids anywhere in the world. And they would not have their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities. Company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public. Several 5-mg pills of Oxycodone are seen June 17, 2019, in Zelienople, Pa.

About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal. All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue’s opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive. One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn’t help people with substance use disorder. “Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can’t do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York. Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. “Some Sacklers are bad people,” he said, “but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.” Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars. ___ This article has been corrected to remove a reference to lawyers for Sackler family members asking a judge to approve the settlement."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/commercial-drivers-licenses-california-duffy-immigrants-newsom-76077ff8e4cfd706ead9bef99eb7fc79","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"15:52:09+00:00","title":"Federal Court Halts New Restrictions on Immigrant Commercial Driver Licenses","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal appeals court in the District of Columbia has temporarily blocked the Transportation Department’s new restrictions on immigrant commercial driver’s licenses, citing procedural errors and a lack of evidence that such licenses increase crash risk.

2025-11-14T15:52:09+00:00\n\nThe Transportation Department’s new restrictions that would severely limit which immigrants can get commercial driver’s licenses to drive a semitrailer truck or bus have been put on hold by a federal appeals court. The court in the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in September a month after a truck driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people can’t be enforced right now. The court said the federal government didn’t follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to “articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety.” The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5% of all commercial driver’s licenses but only about 0.2% of all fatal crashes, the court said. Duffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state’s records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules — not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.

Here’s what to know about the case. 4 MIN READ The court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on “This is not a ruling on the merits of the case. Secretary Duffy will continue working to keep unqualified, foreign drivers off American roads,” a Transportation Department spokesman said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office didn’t respond immediately Friday to questions about the ruling. Newsom’s office has said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when issuing these licenses to noncitizens. Duffy has said the Florida crash, along with fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year, highlighted questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only added to the concerns. The driver in the Florida crash, Harjinder Singh, appeared before a judge in St. Lucie County, Florida, on Thursday, where his attorneys asked to continue his court proceedings into January as they prepare for trial. Singh has pleaded not guilty to three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter. The new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Trucking trade groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association have supported the new rule. There is a bill in Congress that would enshrine the new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses in law. “For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,” said Todd Spencer, the trucking association’s president. Duffy has said that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy has revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he said earlier this week that he may take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. ___ Associated Press writer Kate Payne contributed to this report from Tallahassee, Florida."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-pardon-biden-justice-department-ed-martin-d525b1911534a40f70394fddf396acc1","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"01:51:10+00:00","title":"Trump’s Pardons Raise Questions Over Signature Authenticity After Technical Error","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump personally signed seven pardons on November 7, 2025, and initially posted them online with nearly identical signatures, prompting public and expert concern.

In fact, the signatures on several pardons initially uploaded to the Justice Department’s website were identical, two forensic document experts confirmed to The Associated Press. Within hours of the online speculation, the administration replaced copies of the pardons with new ones that did not feature identical signatures. It insisted Trump, who mercilessly mocked his predecessor’s use of an autopen, had originally signed all the Nov. 7 pardons himself and blamed “technical” and staffing issues for the error, which has no bearing on the validity of the clemency actions. The questions about Trump’s signature come amid a new flurry of clemency and weeks after the president claimed to not even know Changpeng Zhao, a crypto billionaire he pardoned last month. He said in an interview with 60 Minutes that the case had been “a Biden witch hunt.” Related Stories What to know about the 2020 Georgia election case and its new prosecutor 4 MIN READ Trump cuts ties with ‘Wacky’ Marjorie Taylor Greene, once among his top MAGA-world defenders 3 MIN READ Judge indefinitely bars Trump from fining University of California over alleged discrimination 3 MIN READ “A basic axiom of handwriting identification science is that no two signatures are going to bear the exact same design features in every aspect,” said Tom Vastrick, a Florida-based handwriting expert who is president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners. “It’s very straightforward,” said Vastrick, who compared the apparently identical images, now only visible through the online Internet Archive, with the replacements at AP’s request. Chad Gilmartin, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the “website was updated after a technical error where one of the signatures President Trump personally signed was mistakenly uploaded multiple times due to staffing issues caused by the Democrat shutdown.” “There is no story here other than the fact that President Trump signed seven pardons by hand and DOJ posted those same seven pardons with seven unique signatures to our website,” Gilmartin said in a statement to AP, referring to the latest wave of clemency Trump has granted in recent weeks. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email that Trump “signed each one of these pardons by hand as he does with all pardons.” “The media should spend their time investigating Joe Biden’s countless auto penned pardons, not covering a non-story,” she wrote. Trump has been an outspoken critic of Biden’s use of the autopen to conduct executive business, going as far as to display a picture of one such device in place of a portrait of his predecessor in a new “Presidential Walk of Fame” he created along the West Wing colonnade. His Republican allies in Congress last month released a blistering critique of Biden’s alleged “diminished faculties” and mental state during his term that ranked the Democrat’s use of the autopen among “the greatest scandals in U.S. history.” The Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden’s actions in office and sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a full investigation. “Senior White House officials did not know who operated the autopen and its use was not sufficiently controlled or documented to prevent abuse,” the House Oversight Committee found. “The Committee deems void all executive actions signed by the autopen without proper, corresponding, contemporaneous, written approval traceable to the president’s own consent.” On Friday, Republicans who control the committee released a statement that characterized Trump’s potential use of an electronic signature as legitimate, which it distinguished from Biden’s. But Rep. Dave Min, a California Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, seized on the apparent similarities in the initial version of the pardons and called for an investigation of the matter, deploying the Republican arguments against Biden in a statement to AP that “we need to better understand who is actually in charge of the White House, because Trump seems to be slipping.” Regardless, legal experts say the use of an autopen has no bearing on the validity of the pardons. “The key to pardon validity is whether the president intended to grant the pardon,” said Frank Bowman, a legal historian and professor emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law who is writing a book on pardons. “Any re-signing is an obvious, and rather silly, effort to avoid comparison to Biden.” Much of Trump’s mercy has gone to political allies , campaign donors and fraudsters who claimed they were victims of a “weaponized” Justice Department. Trump has largely cast aside a process that historically has been overseen by nonpolitical personnel at the Justice Department. Casada, a disgraced former Republican speaker of the Tennessee House, was sentenced in September to three years in prison. He was convicted of working with a former legislative aide to win taxpayer-funded mail business from state lawmakers who previously drove Casada from office amid a sexting scandal. Strawberry was convicted in the 1990s of tax evasion and drug charges. Trump cited the 1983 National League Rookie of the Year’s post-career embrace of his Christian faith and longtime sobriety when pardoning him. McMahon, a former New York City police sergeant, was sentenced this spring to 18 months in prison for his role in what a federal judge called “a campaign of transnational repression.” He was convicted of acting as a foreign agent for China after he tried to scare an ex-official into going back to his homeland. McMahon’s defense attorney, Lawrence Lustberg, said he was not aware the pardon documents had been replaced until he was contacted Friday by an AP reporter. “It is and has always been our understanding that President Trump granted Mr. McMahon his pardon,” Lustberg wrote in an email. ___ Mustian reported from Natchitoches, Louisiana.

2025-11-14T22:28:28+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue , resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. “We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, “I say they may, in some cases” have that effect. “But to a large extent they’ve been borne by other countries,” the president added.

The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren’t a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday’s move as an acknowledgement that Trump’s policies were hurting American pocketbooks. “President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,” Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. “After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters’ fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a ‘pivot to affordability.’” Grocery bill worries Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don’t increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump’s tariffs on Brazil , a major beef exporter, had been a factor. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren’t produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump’s move to provide “swift tariff relief,” noting that import U.S. taxes “are an important factor” in a “complex mix” of supply chain issues. “President Trump’s proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,” the association said in a statement. In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he’d since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. Indeed, Friday’s announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. “Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs,” the president said then. “We’re going to have some coffee come in.” Tariff checks? Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, “Sometime during the year.” Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. “This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,” Trump said. “Everybody but the rich will get this. That’s not made up. That’s real money. That comes from other countries.” __ Associated Press writer Chris Megerian on Air Force One contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/peptide-injections-rfk-maha-4d48e78a5d65658b4d6eac87818352e3","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:03:15+00:00","title":"Americans Injecting Unapproved Peptides Amid Push to Challenge FDA Regulations","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing trend of Americans using unapproved peptide injections — such as BPC-157, TB-500, and ipamorelin — for muscle building, skin rejuvenation, and anti-aging is gaining momentum, driven by celebrity influencers and figures like Health Secretary Robert F.

Behind the trend is the surging popularity of GLP-1 weight loss medications , a class of so-called peptides approved to help users quickly shed pounds . But the peptides being promoted by influencers , celebrities and wellness gurus are different: Many have never been approved for human use and much of their purported evidence comes from studies in rats and other animals.

It’s actually quite extraordinary.” Those who’ve highlighted peptides’ benefits include Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who has built a national following among Americans who are deeply skeptical of health experts, pharmaceutical companies and traditional medicine. For years, the Food and Drug Administration has been trying to crack down on the space, sending warning letters to clinics that promote the products and adding more than two dozen peptides to a list of ingredients that should not be made by specialty pharmacies that often custom mix the formulations.

Kennedy has vowed to end “FDA’s war” on peptides and other alternative treatments that are embraced by many in his Make America Healthy Again movement. Some of Kennedy’s friends and associates are among the biggest proponents, including self-described “biohacker” and “longevity expert” Gary Brecka, who sells peptide injectables, patches and nasal sprays through his website for $350 to $600 each. In a May appearance on Brecka’s podcast, Kennedy again promised to “end the war at FDA” on peptides, stem cells , psychedelics and other fringe therapies. “Music to my ears,” Brecka replied. Brecka declined to be interviewed for this story. Peptides are now part of the ‘circus’ of unproven wellness products Peptides are essentially the building blocks of more complex proteins. Inside the human body, peptides trigger hormones needed for growth, metabolism and healing. The FDA has approved a number of peptides as medications, including insulin for diabetics who don’t naturally produce it and human growth hormone for children with developmental disorders caused by low levels of the hormone. A closer look at the unapproved peptide injections promoted by influencers and celebrities But many other peptides promoted online have never been approved, making them technically illegal to market as drugs. Under current FDA guidance these peptides also are ineligible for compounding — the process in which pharmacies mix made-to-order medications for patients. That hasn’t stopped celebrities and influencers from touting them. Joe Rogan , for example, has repeatedly praised BPC-157, a peptide derived from acids found in the gut. “I had tendonitis in my elbow, I started using BPC-157 and it was gone in two weeks,” Rogan told his podcast audience last year. He is among the celebrity clients listed on the website of Ways 2 Well, a Texas-based company that offers peptides, stem cells , vitamin infusions and other alternative treatments. It’s all part of “the circus of unproven, expensive and possibly dangerous” offerings promoted by wellness and longevity clinics , said Topol, who has written about the industry. For $99, Ways 2 Well offers a “peptide consult” with a physician, after which the company ships the peptide vials along with a “full kit with dosing, instructions and syringes,” according to its website. Company founder Brigham Buhler is a former pharmaceutical sales rep. He did not respond to requests for comment. Peptides are often pitched as a ‘natural’ alternative to modern medicine Andrea Steinbrenner, a consulting executive, said she became intrigued by peptides after hearing about their benefits for “longevity, repair, anti-aging and energy,” from an acquaintance who runs a clinic outside of San Diego. Steinbrenner and her husband now receive monthly infusions at the clinic, in addition to daily supplements. “I think peptides are popular right now because we are the aging generation and we are looking for alternatives to modern day medicine,” she said. “I absolutely believe in modern day, western medicine— it’s necessary. But there’s a lot of other things in the universe that the earth supplies.” Andrea Steinbrenner receives an IV infusion at Pure Alchemy Wellness, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025, in Chula Vista, Calif.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Peptide proponents often suggest their products are safe because they are based on substances found in the body. “Unlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, peptides are naturally recognized by your body,” Brecka told his more than 2 million Instagram followers in February. Critics point out that the peptides for sale are often imperfect synthetics and are taken at doses much higher than any peptides in the body, raising the risk of allergic reactions and other harms. Brecka sells more than a half-dozen peptides, including ipamorelin and CJC-1295 — both of which the FDA has flagged for serious safety risks. Like other peptides sold on Brecka’s website, the ipamorelin vials carry the labeling: “research use only.” Research claims are often a ploy to dodge regulators The “research use” language is pervasive across the peptide space, even in forums where users trade tips for buying, dosing and “stacking” different drug combinations. One Facebook group instructs members what words to avoid: “instead of ‘taking’ you are ’researching’ peptides.” Lawyers who work in the field say the language is an attempt to skirt FDA regulations. The agency does not oversee chemicals that aren’t intended for human use.

Pharmacies violating the measure risk fines, legal action or potential loss of their state licenses. That triggered pushback from wellness entrepreneurs and compounding pharmacies, including lawsuits. One coalition, Save Peptides, warned its followers: “Our basic human rights to access alternative medical care using regenerative peptides is being stripped away by the FDA.” A lawsuit brought by a large compounding pharmacy alleged that regulators had skipped legally required steps when adding peptides to FDA’s list of high-risk substances. The litigation forced the agency to backtrack, and the FDA late last year agreed to convene two public meetings of outside advisers to review several peptides flagged for safety risks. In each case, the experts agreed with the FDA, voting that the substances were too risky to be compounded. Some in the industry disagree. “Physicians should have every available arrow in the quiver to treat illness and, because of the FDA’s inaction, they don’t,” said Lee Rosebush, who helped bring the lawsuit against FDA and represents a group of large compounding pharmacies. Changes may be coming The FDA, under Kennedy’s authority, recently removed a number of experts from the compounding advisory panel. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Alternately, the FDA could simply release a list of peptides and tell pharmacies and clinics that the agency won’t enforce bans against them. For now, doctors say they are fielding more questions from patients excited about peptides and seeking prescriptions. “Patients should be really asking their health care professionals: Are these medications safe long term?” says Dr. Anita Gupta of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who served on FDA’s compounding committee until earlier this year. “That’s the question I would ask if I was a patient.” ___ AP video journalist Javier Arciga contributed to this story from San Diego. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

2025-11-14T05:05:42+00:00\n\nBy the time Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the financier. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein’s relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. During that time, Epstein’s network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein’s crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up. The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein’s influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender. Epstein kept a diverse political network Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors. In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year. Bannon first forwarded Epstein a news clip that described the German media as “underestimating” Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.” “luv it,” Epstein responded. Epstein wrote that he’d just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you’ll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn’t work.” “its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.” In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director. “you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment. Epstein’s wealthy social circles The financier emailed often with people in the upper echelons of wealth around the world, brokering introductions and chatting about politics and foreign affairs. That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.” Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he couldn’t complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean.” It’s unclear if Thiel ever responded. In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.” “Trump doesn’t like him,” responded Sulayem. A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.” “Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back. In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?” Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and “your other friend,” Prince Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft.” But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here.” He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman. “It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote. Epstein kept in touch with academics The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him. “Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice,” Krauss asked Epstein. In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he’d had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. “No. We didn’t have sex. Decided it wasn’t a good idea,” replied Krauss. Krauss said in an email to The Associated Press that he never hid the fact that he knew Epstein, and interacted with him several times. “I sought out advice from essentially everyone I knew when false allegations about me were circulated in the press in 2018,” said Krauss. “I was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested” in 2019. In an August 2015 email exchange, Epstein told Chomsky, the famed linguist and social scientist, to only fly to Greece if he feels well, joking he previously had to send a plane for another “lefty friend” to see a doctor in New York. In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky’s use. “you are of course welcome to use apt in new york with your new leisure time, or visit new Mexico again,” Epstein wrote. The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump. Other emails showed a closer relationship. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I’m busy’. I said awfully coy u are.” Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.” Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.” “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement,” the statement said. Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organizations’ websites. ___ Associated Press reporters John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, and Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to fix spelling of former French president Sarkozy’s first name, It also corrects that Epstein was not a billionaire."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1511-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:11:20.202-20:00","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This multi-topic news article covers a range of global issues, including allegations of human trafficking by shadowy entities linked to Israel and Palestinian authorities, health concerns involving a British street artist and an individual exposed to a dangerous toxin, ongoing investigations into a blast in New Delhi, developments in the ATP tennis finals, a major opioid settlement for victims, personal trauma stories from adoptees, the 360-day milestone of Russia's war on Ukraine, legal scrutiny of political lobbying by Eduardo Bolsonaro targeting Donald Trump, and humanitarian concerns in Gaza due to Israeli aid restrictions.

to continue dumping heavy rain over the region for days as forecasters warned of rockslides and debris flows especially in the Los Angeles areas that were ravaged by wildfires earlier this year. More than four inches of rain fell over coastal Santa Barbara County early Friday as the storm moved south toward Los Angeles, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasters also warned of damaging winds and possibly even a tornado could form as they urged people to stay indoors. While not usually associated with California, a tornado briefly touched down in a Los Angeles suburb during a storm in 2023, ripping roofs off a line of commercial buildings and injuring one person. A smaller one also hit a mobile home park in the Santa Barbara County city of Carpinteria, damaging about 25 residences. The long plume of tropical moisture that formed over the Pacific Ocean began drenching the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday and was expected to unleash widespread rain over Southern California through Sunday with the heaviest amounts on Friday and Saturday nights. More than a foot of snow was predicted for parts of the Sierra Nevada.

Evacuation orders, which are mandatory, were issued for specific high-risk properties in the Palisades and Eaton fire burn areas from Friday evening to Sunday morning. Law enforcement were going door-to-door in those areas to urge people to leave, the county said. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Randy St. Aubyn, a homeowner in the Sierra Madre neighborhood by the Eaton fire burn scar, stood Friday afternoon behind wooden planks secured by sand bags in front of his house to deflect potential mud flows into the wash. He built the “mud fence” after a massive mud flow during storms a few years ago filled the crawl space under his house, lifting up the first floor. “Irrespective of what the news is saying and what you hear, you prepare for the worst. And then you can sleep at night,” he said. The heaviest rain could dump as much as an inch an hour over a large portion of the region. “The period of most concern is tonight through Saturday Night,” the National Weather Service said. “During this time, folks should be prepared for ample traffic incidents, delays, and a few road closures. This includes a few flooded roads, freeway lanes, and on-ramps and offramps.” While major effects of the storm have not yet been seen, a large downed tree smashed a car in an LA neighborhood Friday morning, local news outlets reported. No injuries were reported. Canyon roads, especially the most vulnerable ones like Topanga Canyon, will likely see mudslide and rockslides, and other neighborhoods ravaged by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area earlier this year should be on high alert, according to the weather service. More wet weather is expected early next week with another storm bringing light to moderate rain, offering only a brief break from the dousing. And yet another storm is predicted to follow that days later."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/us-stocks-ai-china-japan-6edce247294508cd84c941b8ad55d8da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"04:58:45+00:00","title":"AP News: Wall Street Erases Early Loss as Nvidia and Bitcoin Swing","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. stock market experienced early volatility on Friday, November 14, 2025, with a sharp drop in tech stocks including Nvidia, which fell 3.4% before rebounding 1.8%.

Nvidia, which has become the poster child of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, began the day with a loss of 3.4%. It then stormed back to a rise of 1.8% and yanked the market in its wake. Critics have been warning that the U.S. stock market could be primed for a drop because of how high prices have shot since April, leaving them looking too expensive. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania. Nvidia’s stock has more than doubled in four of the last five years, for example, and the chip company is still up more than 40% for this year so far.

Outside of tech, Walmart edged down 0.1% after saying CEO Doug McMillon will retire in January in a surprise move. It had been down as much as 3.6% in the morning. McMillon helped the retailer embrace technology more. All told, the S&P 500 fell 3.38 points to 6,734.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 309.74 to 47,147.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 30.23 to 22,900.59.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More If it falls short of analysts’ expectations, more drops could be on the way. That would have a big effect on the market because Nvidia has grown to become Wall Street’s largest stock by value. That gives Nvidia’s stock movements a bigger effect on the S&P 500 than any other’s, and it can almost single-handedly steer the index’s direction on any given day. Another way for stock prices broadly to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying less in interest can make investors willing to pay higher prices for stocks and other kinds of investments. Treasury yields had been falling for most of this year on expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut its main interest rate several times. And the Fed has indeed cut twice already in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market . But questions are rising about whether a third cut will actually come after the Fed’s next meeting in December, something that traders had earlier seen as very likely. The downside of lower interest rates is that they can make inflation worse, and inflation has stubbornly remained above the Fed’s 2% target. Fed officials have pointed to the U.S. government’s shutdown , which delayed the release of updates on the job market and other signals about the economy. With less information and less certainty about how things are going, some Fed officials have suggested it may be better just to wait in December to get more clarity. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.14% from 4.11% late Thursday. Specialist Anthony Matesic works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Nov. 14, 2025.

It fell below $95,000, back to where it was in May. It had been near $125,000 only in October. The price of gold, meanwhile, sank 2.4%. It shot to records throughout the year as investors looked for something that could protect from high inflation and big debt loads built by the U.S. and other governments worldwide. But interest rates staying higher can hurt gold, which pays its investors nothing in interest or dividends. In stock markets abroad, indexes dropped across Europe and Asia.

Islands-flagged oil tanker as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz on Friday, a U.S. official said, turning the ship into Iranian territorial waters in the first-such interdiction in months in the strategic waterway . Iran did not acknowledge the seizure, though it comes as Tehran has been increasingly warning it can strike back after facing a 12-day war in June with Israel that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites. The ship, the Talara, had been traveling from Ajman, United Arab Emirates, onward to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted it, said the U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats approaching the Talara. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible “state activity” forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters. Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement later said in a statement that it had “lost contact” with the tanker, which was carrying high sulphur gasoil.

Those attacks began after U.S. President Donald Trump in his first term in office unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. In May 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and held them until November of that year. Iran seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024. Those attacks found themselves subsumed by the Iranian-backed Houthis assaults targeting ships during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which drastically reduced shipping in the crucial Red Sea corridor. The years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, exploded into a full-scale 12-day war in June. Iran long has threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes.

2025-11-14T04:49:54+00:00\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina firing squad has executed a man Friday, the third person to die by that method in the state this year. Three prison employees, all with live ammunition, volunteered to carry out the execution of Stephen Bryant, 44, who was pronounced dead at 6:05 p.m. Bryant killed three people in five days in a rural area of the state in 2004. Bryant chose to die by firing squad instead of lethal injection or the electric chair. He made no final statement and briefly glanced toward the 10 witnesses before the hood was placed on his head. The shots rang out about 55 seconds later. Bryant made no noise. The red bullseye target that marks the location of his heart flew forward off his chest. He had a few shallow breaths and then a final spasm a little over a minute later. A doctor checked him with a stethoscope for a minute before he pronounced Bryant dead. A media witness said after the execution that a pool of wetness emerged on Bryant’s chest where he was shot. Three family members of victims who served as witnesses held hands during the execution. Bryant is the seventh person put to death by South Carolina in 14 months after the state had a 13-year pause in executions when it couldn’t obtain lethal injection drugs. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster denied clemency for Bryant, according to his office. No South Carolina governor has offered clemency since the death penalty resumed in the U.S. in 1976. Final meal and memory For his final meal, Bryant had spicy mixed seafood stir-fry, fried fish over rice, egg rolls, stuffed shrimp, two candy bars and German chocolate cake. Bo King, a lawyer who works on death penalty cases in South Carolina, said Bryant had a genetic disorder, was a victim of sexual and physical abuse by relatives, and his mother’s binge drinking “permanently damaged his body and brain.” “Mr. Bryant’s impairments left him unable to endure the tormenting memories of his childhood,” King wrote in a statement. King said Bryant “showed grace and courage in forgiving his family and great love for those in and outside of his prison.” “We will remember his unlikely friendships, his fierce protectiveness, and his love for nature, the water, and the world,” King wrote. Firing squad vs. lethal injection drugs The firing squad has a long and violent history around the world. Death by a hail of bullets has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America’s Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. But in recent years, it’s been revived in the U.S. Some lawmakers say it’s the quickest and most humane way to execute a person. That’s since a number of botched executions by other methods, including lethal injection drugs. South Carolina and other states have struggled to maintain adequate supplies of lethal injection drugs. In part because of this, South Carolina paused executions for 13 years. The state then restarted in September 2024, after which four men have been executed by lethal injection and three by firing squad. The state is among several where the electric chair is still legal. King, the lawyer speaking on Bryant’s behalf, said each of the seven executions have been “brutal and shameful.” “None has made South Carolina safer or more just,” King said. The three other recent firing squad executions in the U.S. have been in Utah with none in that state since 2010. The method is also still legal in Idaho and a backup method if others aren’t available in Oklahoma and Mississippi. The 2004 killings in rural South Carolina Bryant admitted to killing Willard “TJ” Tietjen in October 2004 after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble. Tietjen was shot several times. Bryant then answered Tietjen’s phone after it rang several times telling both his wife and daughter that he was the prowler and had killed them, prosecutors said. Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of the road, he shot them in the back, authorities said. During the search, officers stopped nearly everyone driving on dirt roads in the area just east of Columbia, and told people to be leery of anyone they did not know asking for help. Bryant is the 43rd man killed by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S. At least 14 others are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year. Bryant is also the 50th person executed in South Carolina since the state restarted the death penalty 40 years ago. What happens during a firing squad execution The curtain opens in the death chamber of the prison with fewer than a dozen witnesses sitting behind bulletproof glass. The person is strapped into a chair. A white square with a red bull’s-eye target is placed over his heart by a doctor. Their lawyer can read a final statement. A prison employee then places a hood over the person’s head, walks across the small room and pulls open a black shade where the firing squad waits. Without an audible or visual warning to witnesses, the shooters then fire high-powered rifles from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away. A doctor will then come out within a minute or two, examine him and declare him dead. Lawyers for the last man executed by a firing squad said the shooters nearly missed the heart of Mikal Mahdi. They suggested by barely hitting the bottom of the heart that Mahdi was in agonizing pain for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly. ___ Associated Press writer Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis, Tennessee."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:12:47+00:00","title":"California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate conference in Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the Trump administration’s absence of top-level officials, calling it a failure of leadership and a sign of U.S. retreat from climate responsibility.

this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has issued a stark warning that the global 'fossil fuel obsession' is threatening the lives of billions, with at least 2 billion people living near operational fossil fuel sites and over 3,500 new sites being developed.

sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/displaced-palestinian-families-suffer-as-heavy-rains-flood-gaza-tent-camps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:16:58Z","title":"Displaced Palestinian families suffer as heavy rains flood Gaza tent camps","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Displaced Palestinian families in Gaza are suffering from heavy rains that have flooded their fragile tent camps, with over 260,000 families—nearly 1.5 million people—exposed to extreme winter conditions.

makeshift displacement camps in Gaza City, as the United Nations warns that Israeli restrictions on aid have left hundreds of thousands of families without adequate shelter.\n\nAbdulrahman Asaliyah, a displaced Palestinian man, told Al Jazeera on Friday that residents’ mattresses, clothes and other belongings were soaked in the flooding.\n\n“We are calling for help, for new tents that can at least protect people from the winter cold,” he said, explaining that nearly two dozen people had been working for hours to get the water to drain from the area.\n\n“This winter rain is a blessing from God, but there are families who no longer wish for it to fall, fearing for the lives of their children and their own survival,” Asaliyah said.\n\nGaza’s civil defence agency said Friday’s flooding primarily affected Palestinians in the north of the Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people have returned following last month’s  ceasefire agreement  between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFlooding was also reported in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah, said the rescue agency, which urged the international community to do more to “address the suffering” of Palestinians whose homes were destroyed in Israel’s two-year war on the enclave.\n\n“We urge the swift delivery of homes, caravans, and tents to these displaced families to help alleviate their suffering, especially as we are at the beginning of winter,” it said in a statement.\n\nWhile the October 10 ceasefire has allowed more aid to get into the Gaza Strip, the UN and other humanitarian groups say Palestinians still lack adequate food, medicine and other critical supplies, including shelter.\n\nAid groups working to provide shelter assistance in the occupied Palestinian territory said in early November that about 260,000 Palestinian families, totalling almost 1.5 million people, were vulnerable as the cold winter months approached.\n\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)  said this week  that it has enough shelter supplies to help as many as 1.3 million Palestinians.\n\nBut UNRWA said Israel continues to block its efforts to bring aid into Gaza despite the ceasefire deal, which stipulated that humanitarian assistance must be delivered to Palestinians in need.\n\n“We have a very short chance to protect families from the winter rains and cold,” Angelita Caredda, Middle East and North Africa director at the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said in a statement on November 5.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah on Friday, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said Palestinians across Gaza have been voicing fears that this winter would be particularly difficult due to the lack of safe shelter.\n\n“It only rained for a couple of minutes – 30 minutes or so … [and] they were completely flooded,” she said. “Their tents are very fragile and worn-out; they have been using them for the past two years.”\n\nShe added that most Palestinians do not have any other options but to remain in tent camps or overcrowded shelters, despite the difficulties.\n\n“We’re already seeing Palestinian children walking barefoot. They do not have winter clothes. They do not have blankets. And at the same time, the aid that is coming in … is being restricted,” Khoudary said.\n\nBack in Gaza City, another displaced Palestinian man affected by the heavy rains, Abu Ghassan, said he and his family “no longer have a normal life”.\n\n“I’m lifting the mattresses so the children don’t get soaked,” he told Al Jazeera. “But the little ones were already drenched here. We don’t even have proper tents.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with 5,000 cases and two deaths reported across provinces and territories.

status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known as Super Typhoon Uwan in the Philippines, devastated the northern regions of the country after a week of prior damage from Typhoon Kalmaegi, resulting in at least 10 deaths, the displacement of over 1.4 million people, and damage to more than 4,100 homes.

$4.3bn deal for 17 fighter jets amid regional tension\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has announced a $4.3bn deal to buy Swedish warplanes at a time when his country is locked in  tension with the United States .\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Petro confirmed an agreement was reached with Sweden’s Saab aircraft manufacturer to buy 17 Gripen fighter jets, giving the first confirmation of the size and cost of the military acquisition that was initially announced in April.\n\n“This is a deterrent weapon to achieve peace,” Petro said in a post on social media.\n\nThe purchase of warplanes comes as Colombia and much of remaining  Latin America are on edge  due to a US military build-up in the region, and as US forces carry out a campaign of deadly attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n\nWashington claims – but has provided no evidence – that it has targeted drug smuggling vessels in its 20 confirmed attacks that have killed about 80 people so far in international waters.\n\nLatin American leaders, legal scholars and rights groups have accused the US of carrying out extrajudicial killings of people who should face the courts if suspected of breaking laws related to drug smuggling.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has also accused both Petro and his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, of being involved in the regional drug trade, a claim that both leaders have strenuously denied.\n\nPetro said the new warplanes will be used to dissuade “aggression against Colombia, wherever it may come from”.\n\n“In a world that is geopolitically messy,” he said, such aggression “can come from anywhere”.\n\nThe Colombian leader has for weeks traded insults with Donald Trump and said the ultimate goal of the US deployment in the region is to seize Venezuela’s oil wealth and destabilise Latin America.\n\nTrump has long accused Venezuela’s Maduro of trafficking drugs and more recently branded Petro “an illegal drug leader” because of Colombia’s high level of cocaine production. Trump has also withdrawn US financial aid from Colombia and taken it off its list of countries seen as allies in fighting drug trafficking internationally.\n\nAmid the war of words rumbling on between Washington and Bogota, Petro said last week that Colombia would suspend intelligence sharing with the US on combating drug trafficking, but officials in his government quickly rolled back that threat.\n\nThe AFP news agency reports that US and French firms had also tried to sell warplanes to Colombia, but, in the end, Bogota went with Sweden’s Saab.\n\nSwedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson said Colombia was joining Sweden, Brazil and Thailand in choosing the Gripen fighter jet, and defence relations between Bogota and Stockholm would “deepen significantly” as a result.\n\n🇸🇪🇨🇴I'm proud that Colombia today joins the Gripen E family, alongside Sweden, Brazil and Thailand.

Taiwan\n\nChina has urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan, as a diplomatic dispute deepens over threats by new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on the possibility of deploying forces in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nThe tension erupted after Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on November 7 that use of force against the self-ruled island claimed by China could warrant a military response from Tokyo.\n\nBeijing, which  claims Taiwan  as its territory, denounced the remarks as a provocation. On Friday, Beijing said it had summoned Japan’s ambassador.\n\nTokyo in turn summoned China’s ambassador after an “inappropriate” and now-removed social media post by a Chinese consul general in Osaka appeared to threaten Takaichi.\n\nTokyo has since said its position on Taiwan, just 110km (70 miles) from the nearest Japanese island, is unchanged.\n\nIn an online post late on Friday, China’s embassy in Japan warned its citizens against travelling to the country.\n\n“Recently, Japanese leaders have made blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan, severely damaging the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges,” the WeChat post said.\n\nThe situation presents “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan”, it added.\n\n“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese embassy and consulates in Japan solemnly remind Chinese citizens to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future,” the post said.\n\nReacting to the statement, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Saturday that Beijing’s call was “inconsistent with the promotion of a strategic and mutually beneficial relationship”, Jiji Press reported.\n\nThe Japanese government has requested the Chinese side to take “appropriate measures”, Jiji said.\n\nIn a further development on Saturday, China’s largest airlines offered full refunds for flights on Japan routes before the end of the year.\n\nAir China, China Southern and China Eastern all published separate statements on the policies, which will allow ticket holders to refund or change Japan itineraries free of charge for flights from Saturday through December 31.\n\nBeijing insists Taiwan, which Japan occupied for decades until 1945, is part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to seize control.\n\nChina and Japan are key trading partners, but historical mistrust and friction over territorial rivalries and military spending often test those ties.\n\nJapanese leaders have previously avoided publicly mentioning Taiwan when discussing such scenarios, maintaining a “strategic ambiguity” also favoured by Tokyo’s main security ally,  the United States .\n\nA spokesperson for Taiwan’s Presidential Office, Karen Kuo, said Chinese travel restrictions on Japan and live-fire drills in surrounding areas have drawn attention to regional developments. She said Beijing’s “politically motivated, multifaceted threats against Japan pose a grave danger to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific”.\n\nThe China Maritime Safety Administration said  live-fire exercises  would be conducted in parts of the central Yellow Sea around the clock from Monday through Tuesday, and entry to the area would be prohibited, according to official media CCTV, which did not specify the area."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe G4 geomagnetic storm, resulting from multiple solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares, is expected to impact Earth from November 9 to 14, with peak activity on Wednesday, November 12.

hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/trip-of-suffering-gaza-evacuee-details-24-hour-journey-to-south-africa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"21:34:01Z","title":"‘Trip of suffering’: Gaza evacuee details 24-hour journey to South Africa","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Loay Abu Saif, a Palestinian resident of Gaza, described the suffering of a 24-hour journey involving 153 evacuees who traveled from Gaza to South Africa without proper documentation.

to South Africa\n\nA resident of the Gaza Strip, who is one of 153 Palestinians that landed in South Africa without the correct paperwork this week, says the group did not know where they would end up when they left Israel.\n\nLoay Abu Saif, who fled Gaza with his wife and children, told Al Jazeera on Friday that the journey out of the battered and besieged enclave was a “trip of suffering”.\n\n“We were not too convinced that any group … would be able to make this kind of evacuation,” Abu Saif said from Johannesburg, a day after the chartered plane his group was on landed at the city’s OR Tambo International Airport.\n\n“I can say I feel safe … which means a lot for Palestinians, especially for those in Gaza,” he added.\n\nDetails are slowly emerging of a  controversial transit scheme  run by a non-profit, through which activists say Israel is encouraging the displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza by helping them settle in other countries.\n\nBased on Abu Saif’s testimony to Al Jazeera, the Israeli military appears to have facilitated his group’s transfer through an Israeli airport.\n\nThe flight carrying Abu Saif left Israel’s Ramon Airport and transited through Nairobi, Kenya, before landing in Johannesburg on Thursday morning, where authorities did not initially allow the passengers to disembark as the Palestinians did not have departure stamps from Israel on their documents.\n\nAll in all, the journey lasted more than 24 hours and involved a change of planes.\n\nAbu Saif said his family left Gaza without knowing their final destination. They only learned they were bound for Johannesburg when boarding their connecting flight in Nairobi.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, Jordan, on Friday, said Israel was yet to comment on the issue, but it was unlikely the Palestinians who left did so without “Israeli coordination”.\n\n“Nobody can approach that imaginary yellow line [in Gaza] without being shot at. These people had to be bused through the yellow line, through the 53 percent of Gaza that the Israeli army still controls and is operating in out of Gaza, through Israel to the Ramon airport,” she reported.\n\nAccording to Abu Saif, his wife registered the family with a nonprofit called Al-Majd Europe, with headquarters in Germany with an office in Jerusalem, according to their website.\n\nThe group advertised the registration form on social media, he revealed. On how he was selected, Abu Saif said the process appeared to focus on families with children and required a valid Palestinian travel document, along with security clearance from Israel.\n\n“This is all what I know about the criteria,” he said.\n\nWhen asked whether he knew in advance when they would leave Gaza, he said no timelines were given.\n\n“They told us … we will inform you one day before – that’s what happened,” he said, adding that the organisation told them not to carry any personal bags or luggage except relevant documents.\n\nIn terms of cost, people were charged about $1,400-$2,000 per person for the trip, Abu Saif said.

COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action\n\nHundreds of people have joined an Indigenous-led protest on the second day of the UN climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/malian-media-authorities-suspend-two-french-broadcasters","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:58:52+00:00","title":"Malian media authorities suspend two French broadcasters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mali’s media regulator, the High Authority for Communication (HAC), has suspended French broadcasters TF1 and LCI over allegations that they falsely reported during a broadcast on November 9 that the Malian junta had banned fuel sales, that regions like Kayes and Nioro were under complete blockade, and that armed group forces were nearing the capital, Bamako.

al-Qaeda linked armed group.\n\nTF1 is a French commercial television station that broadcasts in several countries, and LCI, La Chaine Info, is a French free-to-air news channel that is also part of the TF1 group.\n\nMali’s High Authority for Communication (HAC) said in a letter to image distributors in Mali, dated November 13 and made public on Friday, that it had suspended TF1 and LCI, claiming

the document read.\n\nThe letter said the authority disputed three passages in broadcasts by the two channels, specifically that “the junta has banned the sale of fuel,” “[the regions of] Kayes and Nioro are completely under blockade,” and “the terrorists are now close to bringing down the capital [Bamako].”\n\nThe channels have not been accessible in Mali since Thursday evening, a journalist for the AFP news agency reported.\n\nSince September, the Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin ( JNIM ) group, linked to al-Qaeda and primarily operating in Mali, has imposed a blockade on fuel entering the landlocked country, by sealing off major highways used by tankers to transport fuel from neighbouring Senegal and the Ivory Coast.\n\nIn recent weeks, fuel shortages caused by the blockade have created long lines at gas stations and further deteriorated the security situation in the country.\n\nSeveral Western embassies, notably those of the United States and  France , have

What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/trump-likely-to-sue-bbc-for-up-to-5bn-as-outlet-reels-from-editing-scandal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:02:21+00:00","title":"Trump says will sue BBC for up to $5bn over edited video","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"United States President Donald Trump has announced plans to sue the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for up to $5 billion, alleging that the network falsely edited a video of his January 6, 2021 speech, creating a misleading impression that he incited the Capitol riot.

next week for as much as $5bn after the  British broadcaster admitted  it wrongly edited a video of a speech he gave, but insisted there was no legal basis for his claim.\n\n“We will sue them for anywhere between a billion and five billion dollars, probably sometime next week. I think I have to do it. They have even admitted that they cheated,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One late on Friday.\n\nTrump’s lawyers had sent the BBC a letter on Monday, accusing it of  defaming the US president  with the video of the speech before the 2021 US Capitol riot and giving it until Friday to apologise and pay compensation for what they described as “overwhelming reputational and financial harm”.\n\nThe controversy centres on the  BBC’s edit  of Trump’s remarks from January 6, 2021, the day his supporters stormed the US Capitol. The dispute has pushed the network into its most severe crisis in decades,  triggering the resignations  of two senior leaders and prompting a wave of political scrutiny.\n\n“The people of the UK are very angry about what happened, as you can imagine, because it shows the BBC is fake news,” Trump said.\n\nHe added that he planned to raise the BBC issue with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has backed the broadcaster’s independence while avoiding taking sides against Trump.\n\n“I’m going to call him over the weekend. He actually put a call into me. He’s very embarrassed,” Trump said.\n\nThe documentary, aired on the BBC’s flagship Panorama programme, stitched together three separate clips of Trump’s January 6 speech. His lawyers say the sequence created the false impression he was inciting the riot, calling the edit “false and defamatory”.\n\nIn an interview with GB News, Trump accused the BBC of misconduct. He said the edit was “impossible to believe” and likened it to election interference.\n\n“I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement,” he said. “Fake news was a great term, except it’s not strong enough. This is beyond fake, this is corrupt.”\n\nHe dismissed the BBC’s apology as insufficient, arguing that the broadcaster had spliced together remarks that were nearly an hour apart. “It’s incredible to depict the idea that I had given this aggressive speech which led to riots,” he said.\n\nBBC chair Samir Shah issued a personal apology to the White House and told British lawmakers that the edit was “an error of judgement”.

Tensions"],"content":"Published: 2025-11-15T00:05:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazil’s ex-president, to face obstruction charge\n\nThe majority on a Supreme Court panel in Brazil has voted to bring  Eduardo Bolsonaro , the third child of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, to trial on charges of obstruction of justice.\n\nOn Friday, three of the five justices on the panel accepted an indictment against the younger Bolsonaro, which accused him of using threats to interfere with a court case against his father.\n\nIn September, Brazil’s Supreme Court sentenced Jair Bolsonaro, who led Brazil from 2019 to 2023, to more than 27 years in prison for allegedly plotting to subvert his loss in the 2022 election by means of a coup.\n\nEduardo Bolsonaro has been among his father’s most prominent defenders throughout his myriad legal woes.\n\nAn elected official in the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo travelled multiple times to the United States in the wake of Brazil’s 2022 election, meeting with President Donald Trump and his Republican officials.\n\nIn March, Eduardo announced he would move to the US to petition full-time on behalf of his father.\n\n“I will focus 100 percent of my time on this single cause: to seek justice,” he said in a social media video at the time.\n\nBut a majority of the justices on the Supreme Court panel determined that there was enough evidence to suggest Eduardo’s actions in the US may have amounted to an illegal pressure campaign, designed to sway his father’s court case.\n\n“There is significant evidence that Eduardo Nantes Bolsonaro’s actions aimed to create an environment of institutional and social instability, applying increasing sanctions to Brazilian authorities and causing economic harm to Brazil,” one justice, Alexandre de Moraes, wrote in his opinion.\n\nTwo other justices, Flavio Dino and Cristiano Zanin, joined de Moraes in voting to proceed to trial, granting a prosecutorial request. Voting on the Supreme Court panel remains open until November 25.\n\nAt question is how Eduardo Bolsonaro may have lobbied the Trump administration to take action against Brazil, in order to drop the case against his father.\n\nJair Bolsonaro and Trump have been close allies, and Trump  has shown a willingness  to intervene in the politics of Latin American countries to support fellow right-wing leaders.\n\nIn Jair Bolsonaro’s case, Trump issued a  letter  in July accusing Brazil of censoring right-wing voices like the former president’s. He also threatened to impose steep tariffs if the case against Bolsonaro continued.\n\n“The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,” Trump wrote in the letter, addressed to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\n“This trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”\n\nAn  executive order  that same month declared Brazil’s actions a “national emergency” and an “unusual and extraordinary threat” against US interests.\n\nBy August, Trump had followed through with his economic threats, slapping Brazil with 50 percent tariffs on many of its exports to the US. It was the highest US tariff rate for any country in the world, matched only by  India  later that month.\n\nThe Trump administration also took specific action against Justice de Moraes, who spearheaded the investigation into former President Bolsonaro.\n\nOn July 18, the US Department of State announced it would  strip visas  from de Moraes, his family and “his allies on the court”, though no additional justice was named directly.\n\nThen, on July 30, the US  sanctioned  de Moraes for “engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics”. The sanctions came under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, ordinarily reserved for grave human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nBy September, the sanctions had been  expanded  to include de Moraes’s wife, Viviane Barci de Moraes.\n\nEduardo Bolsonaro has been vocal in his support of Trump’s efforts on behalf of his father. He has also become a frequent presence at the White House and events themed to Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.\n\nAt one event in March, Eduardo was seen conversing at the Trump Hotel with former White House adviser Steve Bannon, while sporting a green hat with a variation on Trump’s slogan: “Make Brazil Great Again.”\n\nIn August, he told BBC News in Washington, DC, that he supported Trump’s tariff campaign against Brazil.\n\n“I admire President Trump. We’ve met several times in his first and second term,” he told the British broadcaster. “We fought first to sanction Alexandre de Moraes. But if President Trump starts with tariffs, I do believe that he is right and I do support him because of that.”\n\nBut on Friday, in a  statement  posted to social media, Eduardo Bolsonaro denounced the Supreme Court panel’s decision to bring him to trial in absentia, calling it a “WITCH HUNT”. He added that he had no control over the sanctions Trump applied, nor the tariffs.\n\n“Tariffs and the application of the Magnitsky Act are neither at my disposal nor illegal,” Eduardo wrote. “It is clear that Moraes wants to convict me.”\n\nHe went on to argue that he believes de Moraes is attempting to use Brazil’s “clean record law” — a tool to prevent corruption in the government — to bar him from running for office in the future. “Can this be called democracy?” he asked.\n\nIf convicted on the obstruction charges, Eduardo Bolsonaro could face a fine and prison time of up to four years.\n\nJust last week, the Supreme Court panel  also rejected  his father’s attempt to reduce or toss his prison sentence. Jair Bolsonaro remains under house arrest while he appeals his conviction."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/man-jailed-for-smash-and-grab-theft-of-banksys-girl-with-balloon-print","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:40:35Z","title":"Man jailed for ‘smash and grab’ theft of Banksy’s Girl with Balloon print","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 49-year-old man named Larry Fraser was sentenced to 13 months in prison for stealing a print of Banksy’s iconic 'Girl with Balloon' artwork from a London gallery in September 2024.

of street artist Banksy’s iconic Girl with Balloon from a London gallery in September last year.\n\nLarry Fraser, 49, was jailed on Friday by a judge in southwest London after he pleaded guilty to the smash-and-grab burglary of the elusive artist’s painting, valued at 270,000 pounds ($355,200).\n\nDespite trying to conceal his identity with a mask, Fraser was caught on camera, and police tracked him down two days after the theft. The artwork was recovered shortly afterwards, according to London’s Metropolitan Police.\n\n“This is a brazen and serious non-domestic burglary,” said Judge Anne Brown, passing the sentence at Kingston Crown Court.\n\nThe Girl with Balloon first appeared on the streets of London’s Shoreditch neighbourhood in 2002, with Banksy creating versions of the painting on London’s South Bank in 2004 and in the occupied West Bank in 2005.\n\nOne version of the painting  shredded itself into pieces  the moment after it was sold for more than one million British pounds ($1.3m) by London auction house Sotheby’s in 2018.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Scott Mather said: “Banksy’s ‘Girl with Balloon’ is known across the world – and we reacted immediately to not just bring Fraser to justice but also reunite the artwork with the gallery.”\n\nThe secretive British street artist has returned to Palestine on multiple occasions to create artworks, including a version of the girl with the red balloon.\n\nIn 2005, he sprayed nine stencilled images at different locations along the illegal,  eight-metre-high (26-foot) separation wall  that Israel has constructed in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThey included a ladder reaching over the wall, a young girl being carried over it by balloons and a window on the grey concrete showing beautiful mountains in the background.\n\nIn 2007, he painted a number of artworks in Bethlehem, including a young girl frisking an Israeli soldier pinned up against a wall.\n\nIn February 2015, he allegedly  sneaked into the Gaza Strip  through a smuggling tunnel and painted three works on the walls of Gaza homes destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the previous year’s conflict.\n\nIn 2017, he  opened the Walled Off Hotel  in Bethlehem, just four metres from Israel’s separation wall.\n\nEarlier this year, authorities  attempted to scrub  a Banksy painting on a London court wall that depicted a judge hitting a protester and was believed to refer to the country’s crackdown on the Palestine Action protest group.\n\nBanksy rose to fame for sharply ironic outdoor graffiti with political themes.

2025-11-12T13:46:39+00:00\n\nTitle: As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/pa-warns-against-agents-of-displacement-in-gaza-after-south-africa-flight","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"11:38:30+00:00","title":"PA warns against ‘agents of displacement’ in Gaza after South Africa flight","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Palestinian Authority warning has emerged following the arrival of 153 Palestinians in South Africa via a flight from Kenya, after being displaced from Gaza without knowledge of destination or documentation.

those in the Gaza Strip, must be wary of networks that seek to remove them from their homes in line with Israeli interests, the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned.\n\nThe warning came a day after 153 Palestinians, who left Gaza without knowing their final destination and without proper paperwork,  arrived in South Africa  on board a flight from Kenya on Friday and were held up for 12 hours as authorities investigated the issue.\n\nSouth Africa, which is advancing a  genocide case against Israel  at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), gave the war-ravaged Palestinians 90-day visas.\n\nThe Palestinian ministry on Saturday expressed “deep appreciation” for the support from the South African authorities and people, as well as the decision to grant temporary visas for the people who it said departed from Ramon airport in southern Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian embassy in Pretoria said it is working to assist the travellers who have “endured over two years of Israeli genocidal war, killing, displacement, and destruction”.\n\nBut it warned that companies, unofficial entities and unregistered intermediaries inside Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory are trying to mislead Palestinians and incite them towards leaving.\n\n“The ministry calls upon our people, especially our people in the Gaza Strip, to exercise caution and not fall prey to human trafficking, to merchants and companies of blood, and to agents of displacement,” it said.\n\nAccording to South Africa’s Border Management Authority, 130 Palestinians ended up entering the country, while 23 were transferred from South Africa to other destinations from the airport itself. Most are expected to apply for asylum.\n\nA South African humanitarian aid organisation, Gift of the Givers, said it was committed to accommodating the visitors during their stay.\n\nCharity founder Imtiaz Sooliman told public broadcaster SABC that he did not know who had chartered the aircraft, and that the first plane carrying 176 Palestinians had landed in Johannesburg on October 28, with some of the passengers departing for other countries.\n\nHe said accounts from the Palestinian arrivals indicate that Israel appears to be removing people from Gaza and putting them on a plane without stamping their passports, in order to leave them stranded in third countries.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office have not reacted to the incident, but Israel and the United States have repeatedly pushed to move as many Palestinians out of Gaza as possible,  holding negotiations with many countries  over this.\n\nThe Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli military organisation in charge of the Gaza border crossings, was quoted as saying by Israeli media that it received approval from a third country to receive the Palestinians as part of an Israeli government policy allowing Gaza residents to leave. The third country was not named.\n\nAfter facing nonstop bombing and famine in Gaza, the Palestinians were  told to leave behind all their belongings  and hop on a flight to an unknown destination.\n\nAntony Loewenstein, author of The Palestine Laboratory, a book about Israel’s arms and surveillance industry, said the transit scheme could have been operating weeks or months before being noticed.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera from Indonesia’s capital Jakarta that there have been rumours about companies making such flights, which apparently “requires Israeli permission as well as other countries’ permissions”.\n\n“This is the concept of people making money out of other people’s misery,” he said, also pointing to the murky operations and website of the company that ran the scheme.\n\n“I see it as a form of ethnic cleansing,” Loewenstein said. “The issue is people providing [the transit] and the Israeli state facilitating it, a state where many ministers in the Israeli government, and frankly the Israeli public, want no Palestinians left in Gaza, and I fear this is part of that mission.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, located 11 billion light years away and 300 million times the mass of the Sun.

event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute

A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/us-confirms-four-people-killed-in-20th-strike-on-vessel-in-the-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:53:36Z","title":"US confirms four people killed in 20th strike on vessel in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has confirmed a 20th strike on a vessel in the Caribbean, killing four people, with the attack authorized by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and cited as targeting narcotics trafficking.

vessel in the Caribbean\n\nThe United States military has confirmed that four people were killed in a strike on a boat in international waters – the 20th reported attack on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific – as officials of President Donald Trump’s administration were reported to have held meetings on possible military operations in Venezuela.\n\nIn a post on X on Friday, the US Southern Command said the strike on Monday was authorised by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and that the boat was “trafficking narcotics”, without providing evidence.\n\nSouthern Command shared an accompanying video clip that showed an aerial view of the boat travelling in the Caribbean before being struck and exploding in a ball of flames.\n\nInternational law and human rights experts have repeatedly said that such attacks  amount to extrajudicial executions , even if those targeted are suspected of drug trafficking.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered at least 20 military strikes in recent months against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coasts of Latin America, killing some 80 people.\n\nThe Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that senior Trump administration officials held three meetings at the White House this week to discuss options for possible military action against Venezuela, citing unnamed officials.\n\nThe reported meetings come as the Trump administration has continued to significantly expand the US military’s presence in the Latin America region, including with F-35 aircraft, warships and a nuclear submarine.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pentagon said the Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group, which includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with at least 4,000 sailors and dozens of “tactical aircraft” on board.\n\nIn total, there are now about 12,000 US sailors and Marines in the region, in what Secretary Hegseth on Thursday formally named “ Operation Southern Spear “.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\n\nBut Trump  has said  that he would not “necessarily ask for a declaration of war” in order to continue killing people “that are bringing

2025-11-15T00:48:09+00:00\n\nTitle: US bankruptcy court to approve deal with Purdue Pharma and Sackler family\n\nA federal bankruptcy court judge has said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids.\n\nFriday’s deal, overseen by United States Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane, would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7bn over 15 years, with some of the money going to victims of the opioid crisis.\n\nThe new agreement replaces one the US Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies.\n\nIt could also close a long chapter – and maybe the entire book – on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including from heroin and illicit fentanyl.\n\nLawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in US history. Ultimately, lawyers representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue.\n\nThe company filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.\n\nPurdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could “conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss”. But without that possibility, he said: “The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.”\n\nThe saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.\n\nThe US Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids.\n\nIn the new arrangement, entities that don’t opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.\n\nThis time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus, and there has been mostly subdued opposition from individuals.\n\nOut of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted, just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn’t vote.\n\nUnlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse.\n\nA handful of objectors spoke during the three-day hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement.\n\nOthers wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable – something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn’t bar prosecutors from pursuing.\n\nA Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn’t enough.\n\n“The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.\n\nA flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.\n\nMost of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50bn, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.\n\nThere’s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or nor any overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven’t had a say.\n\nBesides contributing cash, members of the Sackler family would formally give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week’s hearing.\n\nThe company would get a name change – to Knoa Pharma – and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026.\n\nFamily members would be barred from involvement in companies that sell opioids anywhere in the world. And they would not have their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.\n\nCompany documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.\n\nUnlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue’s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850m would be set aside for them, with more than $100m of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.\n\nAll of the money for the individual victims would be delivered next year.\n\nAbout 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue’s opioids and will receive nothing.\n\nAssuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each, and those who had them more briefly would get about $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive.\n\nOne woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn’t help people with substance use disorder.\n\n“Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can’t do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.\n\nChristopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court.\n\n“Some Sacklers are bad people,” he said, “but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.”\n\nMost of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate the damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/15/live-israel-closely-coordinated-gaza-families-mystery-transit-to-s-africa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:17:52+00:00","title":"Israel closely coordinated Gaza families’ mystery transit to South Africa","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that Israel closely coordinated the mysterious transit of families from Gaza to South Africa, suggesting a coordinated effort involving state-level planning and logistics.

withdrawing his support for Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling the lawmaker a “lunatic” and accusing her of going “far left”.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform late on Friday, Trump said, “I am withdrawing my support and endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the great state of Georgia.”\n\nThe US leader, labelling Greene “wacky”, said all the lawmaker did was “COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN”, despite his “record achievements” in office.\n\nGreene, a member of the House of Representatives, has long been a reliable ally and fierce defender of Trump, even sporting a Make America Great Again (MAGA) baseball hat at President Joe Biden’s 2024 State of the Union address.\n\nBut in recent months, she has taken positions at odds with the White House and her fellow Republicans, including criticising them during the  just-ended federal government shutdown , saying the Trump administration needed a plan to help people set to lose health insurance subsidies as part of planned cuts.\n\nMore notably, Greene has also become a vocal campaigner for transparency and the full release of files related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – a recurrent scandal that continues to engulf President Trump.\n\nGreene responded to Trump’s announcement on Friday with screenshots of a text message she sent the president about the Epstein case, claiming it “sent him over the edge”.\n\n“It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” she wrote on X.\n\n“Most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream,” she said.\n\nGreene also claimed Trump is going after her “hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next week’s vote

The White House claimed the communications “prove nothing”.\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged his supporters to move on from the scandal, labelling suggestions that there is an Epstein client list with his name on it a “hoax” pushed by his Democratic opponents.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Greene labelled Trump’s resistance to releasing the files a “huge miscalculation”, adding that she does not believe he has anything to hide.\n\nTrump made no mention of the Epstein issue in his post disowning Greene, claiming the schism between the pair began when he discouraged her from running for senator or governor due to low polling numbers.\n\n“She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls any more, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 US Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic ‘s call every day,” Trump said.\n\nTrump continued that Republicans in Georgia are “fed up with her and her antics” and should they find an alternative to run at the next midterms, that candidate will have his “complete and unyielding support”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41Z","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are intensely studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through the solar system, because it offers a rare opportunity to learn about the conditions and composition of objects from other star systems.

study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across.

tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a ban on children under 16 from accessing major social media platforms, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, effective December 10, 2025.

online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at the age of 97.

died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow

where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d6w1glz3qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"23:49:17.275+00:00","title":"Pakistan's army chief gets more powers and lifelong immunity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan’s parliament has passed the 27th constitutional amendment, granting Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir lifelong immunity, expanded command over all branches of the armed forces, and post-retirement responsibilities.

2025-11-14T23:49:17.275+00:00\n\nTitle: Pakistan's army chief gets more powers and lifelong immunity\n\nPakistan's parliament has voted to give army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir new powers and lifetime immunity from arrest and prosecution, a move that critics say paves the way towards autocracy.\n\nThe 27th constitutional amendment, which was signed into law on Thursday, will also make significant changes to the way the country's top courts operate.\n\nThose defending the changes say they provide clarity and administrative structure to the armed forces, while helping to ease a backlog in the courts.\n\nPakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politics - sometimes seizing power in coups, and, on other occasions, pulling levers behind the scenes.\n\nThroughout its history, Pakistan has oscillated from more civilian autonomy to overt control under military leaders like General Pervez Musharraf and General Zia-ul-Haq. Analysts refer to the balance between civilian and military as hybrid rule.\n\nSome see the amendment as a sign that the balance is shifting in the military's favour.\n\n\"For me, this amendment is the latest indication, perhaps the strongest yet, that Pakistan is now experiencing not a hybrid system, but a post-hybrid system,\" says Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington.\n\n\"We're essentially looking at a situation where the civil-military imbalance is about as imbalanced as it could possibly be.\"\n\nThe latest amendment means that Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee Pakistan's navy and air force.\n\nHis field marshal title and uniform are for life and he will be given \"responsibilities and duties\" even after retirement determined by the president with the advice of the prime minister.\n\nThe expectation is that this will give him a prominent role in public life for as long as he is alive.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued it clarifies Pakistan's military command structure.\n\nPakistan's government-operated news agency, the Associated Press of Pakistan, cited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the changes were part of a broader reform agenda to ensure Pakistan's defence keeps pace with modern warfare requirements.\n\nBut others see it as ceding power to the military.\n\n\"There is no balance between the military and the civilians,\" says Munizae Jahangir, journalist and co-chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.\n\n\"They have tilted again that power dynamic towards the military and empowered the military at a time when the military needed to be reined in.\"\n\nThe second controversial area of change are the courts and judiciary.\n\nUnder the amendment a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) will be created which will determine constitutional questions. The FCC's first chief justice and the judges that serve in it will be appointed by the president.\n\n\"It forever changes the shape and the nature of the right to a fair trial,\" says Ms Jahangir.\n\n\"The influence of the executive has increased not just in appointing judges but also constitutional benches. When the state is dictating the constitution of those benches then what hope do I have as a litigant of getting a fair trial?\"\n\nArifa Noor, journalist and commentator, says: \"The judiciary is now quite subservient to the executive.\n\n\"The general consensus seems to be that the judiciary is now going to not really have any independent space to operate for the moment.\"\n\nBefore this amendment was passed, the Supreme Court would hear and decide on constitutional cases. Some said this created a backlog of criminal and civil cases waiting to be heard as judges had to listen to constitutional arguments as well,  arguing that separating the two has helped smooth the court process.\n\nThat has some traction with some lawyers, although Salahuddin Ahmed, a Karachi-based lawyer in the Supreme Court, sees that argument as disingenuous. He points out that the majority of cases pending in Pakistan are not in the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Statistically, if you were genuinely worried about making litigation quicker, you would focus on reforms for those cases.\"\n\nIn the hours after the amendment was signed into law, two Supreme Court justices handed in their resignations.\n\n\"The constitution that I swore an oath to uphold and defend is no more,\" said Justice Athar Minallah in his resignation letter.\n\nJustice Mansoor Ali Shah said that the judiciary had been brought under the control of the government and that the 27th amendment had \"torn the Supreme Court to pieces\".\n\nKhawaja Asif, the defence minister, said of the resignations \"their conscience has awakened because their monopoly on the Supreme Court has been curbed and Parliament has tried to prove the supremacy of the Constitution\".\n\nJudges can also now be transferred to different courts without their consent. If they don't agree to the transfer, judges can appeal to the judicial commission and if their reasons for not moving are found invalid the judge would have to retire.\n\nThose in favour argue that this will ensure that courts in all areas of the country can be staffed, but some are worried it will be used as a threat.\n\n\"To pick a judge up from the province where he's been serving and take him to a different high court is something that will place them under further pressure to toe the government's line,\" says Mr Ahmed. He worries that the change will upset the balance in Pakistan.\n\n\"[Our judiciary] has collaborated with dictators in the past, but they've also sometimes nudged the executive. I think if you completely rob people of that hope, then that sends them into other, much uglier directions.\"\n\nMr Kugelman agrees: \"Bottled-up grievances don't bode well for social stability.\"\n\n\"It does indicate a slide towards authoritarianism,\" says Ms Noor, adding that she sees the latest amendment as building on the 26th amendment, made last year, which gave lawmakers the power to pick Pakistan's top judge. There is already speculation of a 28th.\n\n\"It indicates that the balance of power is tilted in favour, heavily tilted in favour, of the establishment.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:35:01.407+00:00","title":"What does Trump want with boat strikes near Venezuela and Caribbean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US has launched a large-scale military campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific under 'Operation Southern Spear', beginning in September 2025, targeting vessels linked to drug trafficking, including those associated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

Caribbean and eastern Pacific have continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear.\n\nTens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US.\n\nThey have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region.\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nPresident Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets.\n\nIn a statement, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nIn at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nIt is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.\n\nBetween 2 September and 13 November, US forces hit at least 21 vessels in 20 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nCollectively, at least 80 people have been killed.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nOne investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nIn a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".\n\nBut some legal experts have said strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that  he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity .\n\nCritics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.\n\nAccording to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.\n\nIn October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\n\n\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"\n\nAs part of the operation, the US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.\n\nThis force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, as well as a range of guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nAdditionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline.\n\nTrump has also acknowledged that he authorised  the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.\n\nThis build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the left-wing socialist government of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nOn 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\nMaduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace.\n\n\"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjr4xw83eko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:11:46.022+00:00","title":"Trump rolls back tariffs on dozens of food products","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump has reversed course on his sweeping tariffs by exempting over 100 food products—including coffee, bananas, beef, avocados, tomatoes, coconuts, and mangoes—from import levies, effective retroactively from November 13, 2025.

dozens of food products\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has  focused on the issue  since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.\n\nThe dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.\n\nThese goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.\n\nTrump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.\n\nHe has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead.\n\nBut grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an  investigation into the meat-packing industry , accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".\n\nHe has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering  $2,000 tariff rebate cheques  to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.\n\nBut the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".\n\nHe added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\"\n\n\"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.\n\nEconomists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.\n\nWhile inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed  price increases , with groceries up 2.7% from last year.\n\nThe Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.\n\nIn another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of  trade deals with four Latin American countries .\n\nThis week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.\n\nThe White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies.

Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the \"mysterious\" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country.\n\nThe group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they \"did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports\", local authorities said.\n\nMost were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's \"empathy [and] compassion\", Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.\n\nSouth Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.\n\nRamaphosa said the group \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site.\n\nIsraeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\".\n\nA statement from the embassy said \"an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\".\n\nThe BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment.\n\nOf the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say.\n\nRamaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister.\n\nIn response, the president said \"we cannot turn them back\", according to News24.\n\n\"Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\"\n\nThe president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a \"proper evaluation\" of the matter and update the public on \"what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is\", according to public broadcaster SABC.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country.\n\nOnce it was established that the absence of this information \"did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum\" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry.\n\n\"All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,\" he said.\n\nSouth African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country.\n\nCivil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft.\n\nOne of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of \"peace, laws and justice\".\n\n\"We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,\" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children.\n\nGift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the \"humiliation they've caused\" the Palestinians.\n\nThe organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and \"using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking\".\n\nSouth Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.\n\nThe country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nLarge pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.\n\nSmaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\".\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj97x2lere0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:31:40.609+00:00","title":"US justice department investigates Epstein's alleged ties to Clinton and banks after Trump request","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Justice Department has launched an investigation into alleged connections between paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein and prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, and figures like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.

Democrats have accused Trump of trying to deflect from questions about his relationship with Epstein.\n\nThe emails, released by the US House Oversight Committee, include many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found that Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 or the 2,324 email threads.\n\nRobert Garcia, the leading Democrat on the committee, said Trump was attempting to \"deflect from serious new questions we have about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\n\nIn addition to Clinton, Trump said he asked the Department of Justice (DoJ) to investigate banks JP Morgan and Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, who is also a prominent Democratic donor.\n\n\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\n\n\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"\n\nClinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.\n\nA spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regrets \"any association\" they had with Epstein, and added that the firm \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump made a formal request or issued a directive to the justice department, or if Bondi was responding to his post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nBondi said she appointed US Attorney Jay Clayton to lead an investigation into the ties with Epstein.\n\nTrump's request comes ahead of the House of Representatives' vote next week on whether the justice department should release all its files related to the investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.\n\nDemocrat Adelita Grijalva's swearing in to the chamber on Wednesday triggered the move, after she immediately signed a discharge petition from calling for the release of the files.\n\nHer signature was the 218th - the final signing needed to trigger a floor vote. Four Republicans joined with Democrats to call for the vote.\n\nInterest in Epstein's relationships was renewed this week after US lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents from his estate, including many mentioning Trump.\n\nDocuments released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday appeared to show correspondence between Epstein and the former US Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers from October 2017.\n\nIn one email, Summers gives Epstein his opinion of Trump early in his presidency, writing: \"DJT is world s luckiest guy in terms of opposition, economy etc. still think his world will collapse\".\n\nA representative for Summers told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 that the former treasury official and past president of Harvard University \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\".\n\nThe documents also included email exchanges between Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nIn one email, sent in 2011, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. While he was discussed in some of the messages released this week, he did not send or receive them.\n\nTraditionally, presidents do not direct the justice department to investigate individuals and companies and have often brought in special counsels - independent attorneys from outside the administration - to carry out investigations.\n\nIt is also rare for an administration to seek an investigation of a predecessor. However, the Biden administration started investigations tied to allegations that Trump tried to interfere with the 2020 election, which were then referred to a special counsel. The cases were dropped when Trump returned to the White House.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Congress, Epstein survivors and the family of Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of his - called for US lawmakers to vote in favour of releasing the files.\n\n\"As you gather with your family this season, remember that your primary duty is to your constituents. Look into the eyes of your children, your sisters, your mothers, and your aunts,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"Imagine if they had been preyed upon. Imagine if you yourself were a survivor. What would you want for them? What would you want for yourself? When you vote, we will remember your decision at the ballot box.\"\n\nOn Friday, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said it would be \"huge miscalculation\" for Trump to oppose the release of material related to Epstein.\n\nGreene was among the four other House Republicans - Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, Thomas Massie - who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the files.\n\n\"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.\n\nOn Friday night, Trump announced that he had withdrawn his support for Greene, calling his formerly close ally \"wacky\" and \"a ranting lunatic\", and offering to back her Republican challenger in next year's midterm elections.\n\n\"That's too bad she's lost a wonderful conservative reputation,\" he told reporters."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9y41v48eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:35:41.355+00:00","title":"Endometriosis dating - Freezing eggs, fatigue and unsexy topics","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how women with endometriosis navigate dating and intimacy, highlighting personal stories of Sophie Richards and Natalie Jones.

just their third date when Sophie and her new love interest Dillon visited a fertility clinic.\n\nThe pair had already discussed intimacy with a chronic condition, egg freezing and other \"unsexy topics\".\n\nFor Sophie Richards, 29, those early conversations were just part of the daunting prospect of finding love when you have  endometriosis , which can cause infertility.\n\nThe condition means cells similar to those in the lining of the womb (uterus) grow in other parts of the body, which can lead to symptoms including period pain, fatigue, plus pain in the lower tummy and back.\n\nWhen Sophie first met her now fiancé, Wales rugby international Dillon Lewis, she felt she had to be up front.\n\nAt the time, she was freezing her eggs - a process she started because of potential fertility issues from her endometriosis.\n\n\"It can be very challenging, especially with endometriosis or something chronic, or infertility issues like I've struggled with,\" Sophie said.\n\n\"How do you bring that up to someone new and hope it doesn't scare them away?\"\n\nDespite it feeling uncomfortable, she brought the condition up soon after meeting.\n\n\"I was having to explain... about injections and surgeries, and all of that, very unsexy topics to be talking about.\"\n\nSource: NHS\n\nIt affects around one in 10 women in Wales.\n\nThere's currently no cure for the condition but there are treatments to help ease symptoms including surgery to cut away tissue, or remove part of the organs affected by endometriosis.\n\nSophie credits fiancé Dillon with being supportive and keen to learn about the condition.\n\n\"I had plenty of hours of education from Sophie over a G&T, because Sophie was so open about it,\" he said.\n\n\"It made learning a lot easier, but she didn't mind the stupid questions as well.\"\n\nThe Newport-based Dragons prop, 29, who has 57 caps for Wales, said asking questions and being open was key to offering a partner support.\n\n\"Just try to help in whichever way, like I always say 'is there anything I can do' with the answer 99% of the time being no but at least I like to ask... and get a hot water bottle every now and again,\" he added.\n\nSophie, now a women's health advocate and podcaster, said that being with someone supportive, whatever the challenges, was vital.\n\n\"I genuinely don't think I could be with someone who didn't want to understand the endometriosis, because ultimately, I will live with it forever. It's chronic,\" she added.\n\nShe wants more women to feel confident talking about the impact endometriosis can have on sex and intimacy, although acknowledged how daunting it can be.\n\n\"Now I'm an open book... six years ago, I couldn't even say the words periods without flushing red,\" she said.\n\nNatalie Jones, from Cardiff, has endometriosis and  adenomyosis , and is currently waiting for her fourth surgery.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who was diagnosed in 2018, has recently started to date again after a period of ill-health.\n\nThe PhD student described herself as naturally a \"spontaneous person\" but said often she is so exhausted she fears cancelling dates may give the wrong impression - that she's unreliable or worse, uninterested.\n\n\"If you're just exhausted sometimes and you have to cancel plans especially in a new relationship, that might sound like you're just putting somebody off, or you're unreliable or you're messing someone around.\"\n\nThe academic researcher said it can be particularly complicated when it comes to sex with the extra worry of heavy bleeding or pain.\n\n\"You don't want to set that expectation that intimacy is going to happen by having that discussion too early on but then if one thing leads to another, when do you bring it up, do you stop midway and say, 'oh by the way',\" she said.\n\nThe keen traveller and gym-goer said that while it can be difficult watching friends start to settle down, she doesn't let it affect her.\n\n\"This is something that I can't control, but that doesn't take away from who I am and so if I'm dating or speaking with somebody who isn't prepared to either learn or understand... then that's probably not the right person anyway,\" she added.\n\nPelvic health physiotherapist Pauline-Clare Callaghan said while there has been progress in recent years regarding open discussions around menstrual health and menopause, there's still much more to be done especially in endometriosis-related sexual pain.\n\nThe healthcare professional, who has a special interest in endometriosis, said sexual pain with the condition can be complicated and may relate to the location of scar tissue, adhesions and fibrosis, or pelvic floor muscle being overactive, tight or inflamed.\n\n\"There are effective conservative treatments including pelvic physio but there is a care gap, there are many barriers to addressing sexual pain in endometriosis, including lack of awareness/understanding of support available, shame, embarrassment, cultural issues, and care access issues,\" she said.\n\nFaye Farthing from  Endometriosis UK  said the condition can have a \"huge impact\" on people's sex lives and relationships.\n\n\"Sex can be a challenging topic to discuss with partners, especially if you're in a new relationship, which is why it's vital societal conversations continue around sex and endometriosis to break down the stigma,\" she said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgy81jlxqgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:39:09.134+00:00","title":"Emails highlight Jeffrey Epstein and Steve Bannon relationship","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A set of emails between Steve Bannon, former chief strategist for Donald Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein reveals a close, personal, and politically engaged relationship.

Donald Trump's chief strategist, was in the UK preparing for a speech at the Oxford Union.\n\nThe event was interrupted by hundreds of protesters and Bannon, who was due to board a flight that night, told Jeffrey Epstein in an email: \"Protesters slowed down speech don't think I can make the flight we r enroute to heathrow\".\n\nEpstein replied: \"There. Is a gulf air that leaves at 950 with a stop in Bahrain\". Bannon replied: \"U r an amazing assistant\".\n\nThe messages were published on Wednesday alongside more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier.\n\nThe release by the House oversight committee in Congress includes an iMessage chat in which Bannon's name is redacted. The BBC has been able to establish his identity by matching the dates, events and places mentioned.\n\nFor example, Epstein discusses chartering a plane from Scotland for the redacted user in the chat, and offers praise for their \"Oxford speech\". Bannon took part in the News Xchange conference in Edinburgh on 14 November, and gave the speech at the Oxford Union two days later.\n\nBannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not reply to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nBannon was one of Trump's closest advisers in the run up to the 2016 election and in the early days of his first administration, but resigned from the White House in August 2017.\n\nHe has acknowledged he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death and reportedly has around 15 hours of footage. In a live taping of his podcast earlier this year, he said: \"We're going to release the film, the five-part series, next year - early next year.\"\n\nBut the newly released documents suggest Bannon's relationship with Epstein went further than being his biographer, with the convicted paedophile occasionally seeming to act like a personal assistant.\n\nA few days before the exchange in which Epstein appeared to have arranged a charter jet for Bannon, Epstein said: \"how does it feel to have the most highly paid travel agent in history \".\n\nBannon thanked him: \"U r pretty good asst\", to which Epstein replied \"Massages. Not Included\".\n\nDiscussing a trip to \"AD\" in another message - presumably meaning Abu Dhabi - Epstein told Bannon: \"I'll make sure you're well looked after.\"\n\nThe released messages also show Bannon and Epstein discussing UK politics in 2018.\n\nEarlier on the same day he spoke at the Oxford Union, Bannon texted Epstein: \"I've gotten pulled into the Brexit thing this morning with Nigel, Boris and Rees Mogg.\"\n\nThen, in what appears to be a reference to Theresa May, the embattled UK prime minister at the time, he added: \"The guys are trying to move on. may today / tomorrow…\"\n\nEpstein advised Bannon: \"I think staying as long as you can uk . Best- so people get the commitment of your follow through.\"\n\nShortly after Epstein asked: \"Will Theresa may survive\". Bannon replied: \"I don't see how BUT the guys over here have no balls\" and added \"Boris ; Gove; Rees Mogg; David Davis - somebody has to step up\".\n\nTheresa May was eventually toppled in May 2019 after surviving two votes of no confidence in December 2018.\n\nA spokesman for Reform UK told the BBC: \"Nigel Farage has never been in a meeting with Steve Bannon, Jacob Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson.\" And there is no evidence such a meeting took place.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote next week on whether the justice department should release all its files related to its investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.\n\nInterest in Epstein's relationships with powerful figures was renewed this week after the release of more than 20,000 pages of documents from his estate.\n\nSome of those mentioned Trump, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing. The president was a friend of Epstein's for years, but says they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested.\n\nWith additional reporting from Josh Cheetham"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylw4pz83do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"01:06:21.855+00:00","title":"Should Hitler's DNA have been studied?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A scientific team led by genetics expert Prof Turi King has analyzed a blood-stained fabric from Adolf Hitler’s bunker, confirming he did not have Jewish ancestry and identifying a genetic disorder, Kallmann syndrome, which affects sexual organ development.

Absolutely not, say the experts - it's not a diagnosis.\n\nBut nevertheless, concerns have been raised about stigmatisation and how ethical the research was, prompting the question - should it have been done at all?\n\n\"I agonised over it,\" says Prof Turi King within the first few minutes of Saturday's Channel 4 documentary on the research,  Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator .\n\nThe genetics expert told the BBC that when she was first approached to take part in the project several years ago, she was very aware of the potential implications on studying the DNA of someone like Adolf Hitler - \"I'm not interested in sensationalising things\".\n\nBut, she says, it was likely to be done by someone at some point, and at least under her watch she could ensure the research was done with academic rigour and with all the \"caveats and guardrails in place\".\n\nProf King is no stranger to high-profile and sensitive projects - she led the genetic investigation to establish  the identity of Richard III's skeleton  after it was discovered buried under a car park in Leicester in 2012.\n\nThe bloodied swatch of fabric - now 80 years old - was cut out of the sofa in Hitler's underground bunker, where he killed himself when Allied forces descended on Berlin at the end of World War Two.\n\nWhile inspecting the bunker, Colonel Roswell P Rosengren of the US army saw an opportunity to get a unique war trophy and he pocketed the fabric. It's now framed and on display at the  Gettysburg Museum of History  in the US.\n\nThe scientists are confident it really is Hitler's blood, because they were able to perfectly match the Y-chromosome with a DNA sample from a male relative that had been collected a decade prior.\n\nThe results, which are now under peer review, are indeed fascinating.\n\nIt is the first time Hitler's DNA has been identified, and over the course of four years, scientists were able to sequence it to see the genetic makeup of one of the world's most horrific tyrants.\n\nWhat is certain, experts say, is that Hitler did not have Jewish ancestry - a rumour that had been circulating since the 1920s.\n\nAnother key finding is that he had Kallmann syndrome, a genetic disorder that, among other things, can affect puberty and the development of sexual organs. In particular, it can lead to a micropenis and undescended testes - which, if you know the British war-time song, had been another rumour flying around about Hitler.\n\nKallmann syndrome can also affect the libido, which is particularly interesting, said historian and Potsdam University lecturer Dr Alex Kay, who is featured in the documentary.\n\n\"It tells us a lot about his private life - or more accurately, that he didn't have a private life,\" he explains.\n\nHistorians have long debated why Hitler was so completely devoted to politics, \"to the almost total exclusion of any kind of private life\", and this could help to explain that.\n\nThese kinds of findings, the experts say, are what make them both fascinating and useful. As Prof King puts it: \"the marrying of history and genetics\".\n\nMore complicated and controversial are the results suggesting Hitler may have had one or more neurodiverse or mental health conditions.\n\nLooking at his genome, and comparing it with polygenic scores, they found that Hitler had a high predisposition for autism, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nThis is where the science gets complex.\n\nPolygenic scoring combs through a person's DNA and calculates how likely they may be to develop a disease. It can be useful to detect an individual's predisposition to conditions like heart disease and common cancers. But it compares their DNA with a large population sample, and therefore the findings can be far less certain when it comes down to an individual.\n\nThroughout the documentary, which the BBC has seen, the experts are at pains to reiterate that the DNA analysis is not a diagnosis, but an indication of predisposition - it does not mean Hitler had any of these conditions.\n\nBut some genetic scientists have raised concerns that the findings are an oversimplification.\n\nDenise Syndercombe Court, professor of forensic genetics at Kings College London, feels they have \"gone too far in their assumptions\".\n\n\"In terms of character or behaviour, I'd have thought that's pretty useless,\" Prof Court, who tested the same blood sample in 2018, told the BBC.\n\nShe said she wouldn't want to make any predictions as to whether someone had a particular condition from the results, because of \"incomplete penetrance\".\n\nPut simply, by fellow genetic scientist Dr Sundhya Raman: \"Just because you have something encoded in your DNA, doesn't mean you'll express it.\"\n\nThis is reflected in the documentary by Prof Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University: \"Going from biology to behaviour is a big jump,\" he says.\n\n\"By looking at genetic results like this, there's a risk of stigma. People out there might think, 'Is my diagnosis being linked to somebody who did such monstrous things?'\"\n\n\"The risk is reductionism down to genetics,\" he says, when there are so many other factors to consider.\n\nThe UK's National Autistic Society was quick to respond, calling the findings a \"cheap stunt\".\n\n\"Even worse than the shoddy science, we're shocked at [the documentary's] callous disregard for autistic people's feelings,\" said Tim Nicholls, assistant director of research, in a strongly worded statement.\n\n\"Autistic people deserve better than this.\"\n\nThe BBC put the concerns to Channel 4 and Blink Films, the production company that made the documentary.\n\nIn a statement, it pointed out that experts like Prof Baron-Cohen \"explain that how someone behaves is a product of many factors, not just their genetics but also, very importantly, their environment, everything from childhood and life experiences, how they were brought up, access to education and resources and the cultural factors around them.\"\n\n\"The programme emphasises that the genetic insights revealed in the films shed light on Hitler, but they don't tell us he was biologically predestined to behave in a particular way.\"\n\nThere have also been raised eyebrows at the very name of the documentary, especially the second part:  Blueprint of a Dictator .\n\nProf King said it wasn't a name she would have chosen, and historian Prof Thomas Weber, who is featured in the programme, told the BBC he was surprised at the title, given they had stressed there is \"no dictator gene\".\n\nThe professor, who had not seen the documentary before speaking to the BBC, said he found the DNA analysis both exciting and concerning.\n\n\"Exciting, because it confirmed a lot of things I already suspected about Hitler... but I had concerns on whether people would read too much into genetics, like trying to find the 'evil gene'.\"\n\nHe was also concerned about how it would be received, especially for people with autism and other syndromes mentioned in the programme.\n\nThere are many difficulties and pitfalls when you're trying to make an accurate programme about complicated science for the general public.\n\n\"It's television - it occasionally gets simplified,\" said Prof King, who has a lot of experience balancing her responsibilities as a scientist with the realities of the media.\n\n\"They [the documentary makers] could have taken a different tack and gone very sensationalist but they haven't, they've tried to catch some of the nuance... and we've put in the guardrails.\"\n\nChannel 4 defended the show's name by saying that \"DNA is colloquially known as the 'blueprint of life'.\" Additionally, its job is to \"make programmes that reach a wide audience, and this programme aims to make complex scientific ideas and historical research accessible to all viewers\".\n\nThere are many questions on the ethics of the project.\n\nShould Hitler's DNA have been examined if his permission - or that of a direct descendant - could not be given?\n\nAnd how does that play into the fact that he was responsible for one of history's worst atrocities? Does that negate his right to privacy?\n\n\"This is Hitler - he's not some mystical character whom no one can conduct DNA research on. Who makes that decision?\" Prof King argues.\n\nHistorian Subhadra Das agrees: \"This is what scientists do. There are hundreds of long-dead people who have had their DNA sampled, it's a common practice in science and archaeology – it's how we read into it that starts to become problematic.\"\n\nHistorian Dr Kay said he wasn't concerned about the ethical angle, \"as long as the facts were there and we made sure everything was double checked\".\n\nAnd on whether Hitler's DNA should have been touched: \"Hitler's been dead for 80 years. He doesn't have any direct descendants and he didn't have any children. He was responsible for untold suffering – we have to weigh that against the ethical dilemma of analysing his DNA.\"\n\nInterestingly, several labs in Europe declined being part of the project, and it was a facility in the US that did the testing.\n\nThe documentary-makers told the BBC that the research \"has gone through the standard ethical review process for academic work\" which includes reviews conducted in two countries.\n\nSo should this research have been conducted at all? The BBC spoke to a range of genetic scientists and historians, and the answer depends on who you ask.\n\nThose in the documentary, naturally, say yes. It helps to build a more rounded profile of Hitler, a person who still fascinates and terrifies in equal measure.\n\n\"We should do whatever we can to understand past extremism,\" Prof Weber believes.\n\n\"Let's be honest,\" says Dr Kay, \"these topics were already out there... we haven't suddenly planted this idea in people's minds. People have been speculating on whether Hitler had certain disorders for decades.\"\n\nNot all historians agree.\n\n\"I think it's a very dubious way of trying to explain what drove Hitler's actions,\" says Iva Vukusic, assistant professor of international history at Utrecht University.\n\nDr Vukusic, whose studies focus on the perpetration of mass violence, told the BBC she can understand why people are interested, but \"whatever answers we seek are not going to be found through a DNA test\".\n\nAnd while the research is interesting, it runs the risk of obscuring the real lessons of history, says Anne van Mourik, historian at the NIOD Institute in Amsterdam.\n\nThat lesson is that \"normal people in certain contexts can commit, instigate or accept horrific violence\".\n\nFocusing on Hitler's (possible) micropenis, she says, doesn't teach us anything about how mass violence and genocide works and why it occurs.\n\nWith the study complete and the research under peer review, at some point, the full findings will be available.\n\nProf Weber says they should be used \"extremely carefully and soberly\", but he's hopeful that it is helpful in some way.\n\n\"That's the nice thing about research results – it might happen in five, 150, 500 years time. This research is there for posterity and I'm confident that smart people will use them in the future.\"\n\nBut we all have a responsibility on how we use these results.\n\nDr Kay says everyone must \"follow the science\" and make it clear on what we know and what we don't.\n\nThat includes the media and how it is reported.\n\n\"Anyone watching this documentary has a responsibility to write on it accurately, to make sure they're not contributing to the stigmatisation.\n\n\"A documentary like this doesn't exist in a vacuum.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0yz5r8lypo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"12:26:07.598+00:00","title":"What next as Donald Trump says he will take legal action against the BBC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump has escalated a legal threat against the BBC, claiming that a Panorama programme misrepresented his speech and demanding compensation ranging from $1 billion to $5 billion.

He called the president \"a litigious fellow\".\n\nThat's an understatement, evident in the number of legal cases Trump has taken out against various US media companies.\n\nThe president, based on his GB News interview, is clearly hurt by what he sees as an \"egregious\" edit, and he has now apparently upped the amount he says he will sue the corporation for.\n\nWhile on board Air Force One on Friday, Trump told reporters the figure would be \"anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn\".\n\nTo put this in context,  the BBC's annual income from the licence fee was £3.8 billion last year .\n\nOn Friday, Trump said: \"They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" He wants to know why Panorama edited two clips of his speech together to give a \"totally different meaning\".\n\nHe doesn't accept the BBC's response  that what happened was unintentional .\n\nThis is a very serious moment in the history of the BBC. It stands or falls by being viewed as impartial - a source to trust in a world where trust in institutions is falling.\n\nInstead, the corporation is being accused of the opposite - and faces an expensive and very public battle with the most powerful man in the world.\n\nSo where does it go from here?\n\nEver since the president first threatened legal action, it was clear that the corporation did not intend to offer him compensation. It believes it has a case that, whatever error was made, no harm was caused to Trump by the Panorama programme.\n\nHe was elected president soon after it went out and anyway, says the BBC, the programme wasn't broadcast on any US channels, so how could it have harmed him?\n\nI think there was a certain consensus, inside and outside the corporation, that the notion of using licence fee payers' money to settle with Trump was a non-starter.\n\nAs one former senior BBC executive put it to me, after the BBC had rejected offering compensation, \"they've made the right call\". But this person also said, if the president did decide to sue, the BBC would have to \"batten down - and get the best lawyers in Florida\".\n\nThe reason to settle would have been to bring down costs in the long run.\n\nNow it looks as if the BBC will be involved in a protracted, costly court battle at a time when it should be 100% focused on the discussions over the renewal of  its charter , which are ramping up.\n\nThe people at the top of the BBC should be fully concentrating on what is, in normal times, a fundamental moment for the corporation - when what it's for, its scope, how it will be funded, the details of its very existence are all hammered out between government and BBC in time for a new charter at the start of 2028.\n\nIt's already losing the man who should have led that -  Tim Davie, the Director General .\n\nNow top BBC brains will be diverted, to game out its next moves in what could be a very damaging, even existential fight with Donald Trump. The legal fees alone could get very expensive.\n\nThis might all have been avoided if the BBC had been open about the error much earlier and corrected it. Instead, it faces a long road.\n\nBut there may be routes off it.\n\nMight the BBC ask the UK government to step in through back channels? Would a call from Prime Minister Keir Starmer persuade Trump to change his mind? Would Starmer even want to get involved and expend his own political capital with the US president?\n\nOne positive for the BBC this week  was the robust nature in which the culture secretary Lisa Nandy defended the corporation .\n\nShe talked about the widespread trust in BBC News and described the corporation as \"a light on the hill for people in times of darkness\" which brings the country together, whether through Celebrity Traitors or its VE Day coverage.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, has called the BBC \"worse than fake news\". He claims the corporation and its journalists are corrupt.\n\nThe fight is well and truly on."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891jp9j79do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:41:00.487+00:00","title":"Trump says he will sue BBC for at least $1bn over Panorama edit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump has announced plans to sue the BBC for up to $5 billion over an alleged misrepresentation of his January 6, 2021 speech, which was edited by the Panorama programme.

over Panorama edit\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn   [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.\n\nThe corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.\n\nThe BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation.\n\n\"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"\n\nThe president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.\n\nA search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.\n\nIn a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"\n\nHe called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nIn July this year, US media company Paramount Global  agreed to pay $16m  (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.\n\nThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nMore than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nIn the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nControversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\n\nIn its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\n\n\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.\n\nLawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\n\n\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.\n\nThey added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nIn its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.\n\nFirst it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.\n\nWhen the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.\n\nSecondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.\n\nThirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.\n\nFourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.\n\nFinally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.\n\nThe BBC's apology came hours after a second  similarly edited clip , broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdngkxedzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"00:14:49.822+00:00","title":"At 16, I was experimented on by the CIA and now I'm suing","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lana Ponting, a 16-year-old girl in 1958, was sent to the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal for behavioral treatment without her knowledge, where she became an unwitting participant in the CIA’s MK-Ultra mind-control program.

2025-11-15T00:14:49.822+00:00\n\nTitle: At 16, I was experimented on by the CIA and now I'm suing\n\nThe first thing Lana Ponting remembers about the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital in Montreal, Canada, is the smell - almost medicinal.\n\n\"I didn't like the look of the place. It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba.\n\nThat hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour.\n\nIt was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control. Now, she is one of two named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for Canadian victims of the experiments. On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed.\n\nAccording to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal.\n\n\"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan.\n\nOnce there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent.\n\nOver 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved.\n\nAt the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\".\n\nDr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times.\n\n\"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled.\n\nThe technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications.\n\n\"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma.\n\nMedical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous gas, a sedative known as \"laughing gas\".\n\n\"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request.\n\nThe harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability.\n\nMs Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she says\n\nFor decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently.\n\nShe says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed.\n\nMs Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan.\n\n\"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said.\n\nShe says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares.\n\n\"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said.\n\nThe Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability.\n\nFor Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure.\n\n\"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\"\n\nAlthough Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967.\n\nBut regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical.\n\nShe says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice.\n\n\"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:31:11.412+00:00","title":"China and Japan in escalating spat over Taiwan: What to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China and Japan are in a significant diplomatic spat over Taiwan, triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s assertion that Japan could activate its self-defence forces if China attacked Taiwan.

travel to Japan and summoned the country's ambassador in Beijing over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan.\n\nChina and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words this week, set off by Takaichi's suggestion that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan.\n\nBoth countries' foreign ministries have lodged serious protests with each other. A Chinese diplomat also made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi.\n\nThe spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about it:\n\nThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\n\n\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.\n\nA \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.\n\nTakaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".\n\nLast Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".\n\nWhile the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.\n\nTokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.\n\nXue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on.\n\nThen on Thursday, China's foreign ministry posted in Japanese and English on its X account, warning Japan to \"stop playing with fire\" and added that it would be an \"act of aggression\" if Japan \"dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation\".\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong also summoned the Japanese ambassador to China that same day to express their unhappiness.\n\nSun called Takaichi's remarks \"extremely wrong and dangerous\" and demanded that Japan withdraw the comments, according to state media Xinhua. He also warned that \"otherwise all consequences must be borne by Japan\".\n\nJapan's ambassador explained that their position on Taiwan \"has not changed\" and refuted Beijing's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"It is the consistent position of the Japanese government that we hope for a peaceful resolution of issues surrounding Taiwan through dialogue,\" he said during the daily news briefing.\n\nKihara also added that Japan \"strongly urged China to take appropriate action\" over Xue's social media comment.\n\nThen on Friday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan published a statement urging citizens \"to avoid traveling to Japan in the near future\" over what it called \"blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan\".\n\nThere is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.\n\nThis was referenced in a statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday when it said that \"should Japan fail to draw lessons from history and dare to take reckless risks, even resorting to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait situation, it will inevitably suffer heavy losses and pay a bitter price in the face of the iron wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\".\n\nHistorical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe ,  suggests more tensions may lie ahead.\n\nThe conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.\n\nTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan.\n\nShe had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.\n\nChina is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.\n\nThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.\n\nThis is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nFor decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.\n\nThe Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.\n\nOn the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nIn 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".\n\nIn this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\n\n\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\n\n\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p5xn8qjpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:55:39.818+00:00","title":"Prashant Kishor: Why India's political start-ups rarely succeed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prashant Kishor, a seasoned political strategist who advised leaders like Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar, and Mamata Banerjee, launched his own political party, Jan Suraaj, in Bihar with a data-driven, governance-focused agenda.

2025-11-15T02:55:39.818+00:00\n\nTitle: Prashant Kishor: Why India's political start-ups rarely succeed\n\nFor over a decade, Prashant Kishor was India's backstage magician -  the political  strategist trusted by everyone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to powerful regional leaders such as Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee.\n\nBut when the 48-year-old finally stepped into the arena himself, the spell snapped.\n\nKishor launched Jan Suraaj (People's Good Governance) with the swagger of a data-driven political start-up and the promise of breaking the cycle of stagnation in Bihar, India's poorest and third most populous state.\n\nHe spent two years walking across the state, built a slick organisation and fielded candidates in almost all 243 seats. The media buzz was huge, but Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat, scraping only a sliver of the vote, as  Modi's BJP-led alliance swept to power.\n\nFor all the attention Kishor commanded - often more than established leaders - the party could not convert visibility into votes. In India's febrile and deeply divided political marketplace, his debut, many believe, stands as a cautionary tale: breaking into the system is far harder than diagnosing its flaws from the outside.\n\nThe modern history of Indian politics bears this out.\n\nSince the rise of the regional Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1983, very few new parties have crossed the threshold of relevance. Those that have - from West Bengal's Trinamool Congress to Odisha's Biju Janata Dal - were breakaway factions of major parties, anchored in existing social bases.\n\nOthers, like Assam's Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in 1985 or Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party  (AAP) decades later, rode on the back of mass mobilisation and political crises. Kishor's Jan Suraaj had neither. It was not born of a street movement, nor did it emerge into a moment of anti-incumbent fury. Despite its many problems, Bihar in 2025 appeared to be largely content with the status quo.\n\n\"There was no anti-incumbency wave - voters largely stuck to established political and social loyalties. Without a visible crisis or widespread dissatisfaction, Kishor's party never appeared a credible alternative, despite hard work and mobilisation,\" says Rahul Verma, a political scientist.\n\nJan Suraaj's debut in Bihar also contrasted sharply with most new Indian parties.\n\nWhile parties like the AGP, TDP and AAP grew from \"socio-political movements that already had deep emotional and grassroots resonance\", and AAP was born from a mass anti-corruption movement, Jan Suraaj was conceived as \"more of an intellectual and strategic project\" - a strategy-driven initiative to fill what Kishor called a \"political vacuum\", says Saurabh Raj of the Delhi-based Indian School of Democracy.\n\n\"The subsequent padayatra [a long, grassroots walk across the state to meet people] tried to turn that intellectual idea into a people's campaign. But it still lacked the organic, movement-based energy that typically propels new parties to relevance. In that sense, Jan Suraaj feels more like a 'designed political start-up' than a party born of agitation or upheaval,\" adds Raj.\n\nKishor bet that this meticulously designed political project could substitute for a loyal constituency.\n\nHe talked of governance, jobs, forced migration for jobs and education - a compelling agenda in a state long trapped by caste and patronage politics. Reaching Bihar's 130 million mostly young people, Kishor brought hype, methods, charisma - and even memes.\n\nBut many believe his party lacked the combustible emotional energy that propels insurgent political outfits. Kishor's refusal to contest a seat himself may have deepened doubts about whether he was running an experiment or offering an alternative.\n\nThe Bihar verdict laid bare a structural truth of Indian politics: attention is not organisation, and media hype without ground strength can backfire.\n\nAs Raj notes, Jan Suraaj \"failed to become a serious contender on any seat\", and even its modest vote share \"shows the gap between visibility and strength\". The party has recognition but no natural social base - no caste, religious, gender or urban constituencies like its rivals, he says.\n\nVerma puts it more bluntly: start-ups fail more often than they succeed - in business and in politics.\n\n\"We tend to remember only the successes, but most new parties fail,\" he adds.\n\nBuilding a party requires visibility, organisation, mobilisation and the right candidates - each a separate challenge, especially without a track record of voters trust, says Verma. Jan Suraaj fielded candidates in 238 seats, most of them first-timers.\n\nWhat does the failure of Kishor's high-profile Jan Suraaj tell us about Indian voters? Kishor drew crowds wherever he campaigned, was articulate and dominated media coverage - yet his party lost to a coalition led by 74-year-old veteran Nitish Kumar, whom he had bet would never return to power.\n\n\"Indian voters today are more politically aware and issue-sensitive than ever before, but they also remain deeply pragmatic. They often appreciate the freshness of a new agenda but tend to 'vote safe' unless convinced of a party's viability,\" says Raj.\n\nHe believes Jan Suraaj's focus on governance, jobs and migration was coherent and appealing, but without a charismatic electoral face, voters struggled to see it as a winning alternative.\n\nBy contrast, AAP's early success in Delhi hinged on anti-corruption campaigner Arvind Kejriwal personally contesting against Sheila Dikshit, the then chief minister of Delhi, a symbolic act that converted volunteers into voters.\n\n\"Kishor's decision to stay away from contesting limited that emotional connect and credibility. For new parties, a compelling agenda matters, but a relatable, risk taking leader who embodies that agenda is often the tipping point,\" says Raj.\n\nYet, this may not be the end for Kishor's party. In the past, he has promised to stay in Bihar and strengthen its grassroots presence and agenda if he lost the polls.\n\nRaj believes if Jan Suraaj can maintain a steady ground presence, cultivate local leadership and avoid the \"post-election dormancy\" that traps many new parties, it may gradually convert attention into influence.\n\n\"Bihar's political landscape is fluid, traditional caste loyalties are evolving and there is a growing appetite for credible alternatives. If Kishor chooses to lead from the front politically rather than strategically, and continues the grassroots engagement beyond the electoral cycle, Jan Suraaj could become a meaningful electoral force by 2030,\" he says.\n\nAs one local voter put it to a reporter in a village in Bihar: \"People might respond to [Kishor] in the next election. This time, he's just getting his feet wet - he's not some superhero who can soar immediately.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykze63r2xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:01:26.372+00:00","title":"Record settler attacks in West Bank opening up rifts within Israel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A surge in Israeli settler violence across the West Bank, reaching record levels since the Hamas attacks in October 2023, has triggered widespread condemnation from international bodies and within Israel's military.

rifts within Israel\n\nThe marks of the attack on Hamida Mosque, near Deir Istiya in the occupied West Bank, are still scattered on the ground outside.\n\nCharred furniture, lecterns and smoky curls of carpet are piled around the entrance - its guts emptied, and debris cleared, in time for Friday prayers.\n\nDozens of men arrived for the prayers in a show of defiance - their backs turned towards the scorched and blackened wall.\n\nThe imam here, Ahmad Salman, told the BBC the attack on Thursday was a message from Jewish settlers, amid a wave of settler violence across the West Bank.\n\n\"The message they want to send is that they can reach anywhere - into cities, into villages, that they can kill civilians and burn houses and mosques.\"\n\n\"I feel it in my soul,\" he said. \"It's not right to touch places of prayer, wherever they are.\"\n\nBut there was a message here, too, for Israel's regional military chief - scrawled in Hebrew on the mosque's exterior wall: \"We're not afraid of you, Avi Bluth.\"\n\nSpiralling settler attacks here over the past six weeks have triggered tough warnings from army leaders, along with a handful of arrests and investigations.\n\nBut expansionist settlers enjoy government support, which some believe is pushing the West Bank towards a dangerous confrontation.\n\nThe annual olive harvest, when Palestinians try to access their farmland, often marks a spike in violence, but the attacks this year have broken UN records.\n\nThe UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs registered more than 260 settler attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in October alone - the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006.\n\nHuman rights groups say that settler aggression towards Palestinians has risen since the Gaza War began in 2023 after the 7 October Hamas attacks. UN figures suggest that more than 3,200 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settler violence and restrictions since then.\n\nIn the past few days, there have been several attacks across the West Bank, including an assault by a large crowd of masked men on an industrial estate and Bedouin buildings near Beit Lid. Security cameras filmed them running across the hillside and through the factory gates, where they torched several trucks.  The army said they later attacked Israeli soldiers operating nearby.\n\nThe Israel police spokesman said four suspects had been arrested. Three have reportedly since been released.\n\nLast week, in the olive groves around Beita, a Reuters journalist, Raneen Sawafta, was beaten by a settler with a club as she was covering the olive harvest - a deep dent in her helmet clearly showing the force of the blows.\n\nHamad al-Jagoub abu Rabia, a volunteer with the Red Crescent in Beita, was also injured after going to help her - hit in the head with a rock and later taken to hospital.\n\n\"I never imagined a human being created by God would do this,\" he said. \"If they had an iota of humanity, they would have never done this to a woman. If it wasn't for her helmet, she could have died.\"\n\nLess than three weeks earlier, 55-year-old Afaf Abu Alia was  badly beaten with a club  as she lay cowering on the ground during a settler attack, after picking olives on farmland she rents near the village of Abu Falah. The video of her assault drew international condemnation.\n\n\"One of [the settlers] attacked me and started beating me - hitting my head, my arms and legs, and kicking my legs with their boots,\" she told the BBC. \"I fell down. I wasn't aware of what was happening, my mind went blank - I was only feeling the pain. I felt like my soul was leaving my body. The only thing I thought about was my children.\"\n\nNow recovering at home, Afaf said she was still in pain, with 20 stitches in her head, and bruises on her arms and legs that left her unable to sleep.\n\nShe said the family had been blocked from its own farmland by settlers, and that they had been renting land elsewhere to grow olives this year.\n\n\"I'd return there today if I could, I'm not afraid of them,\" Afaf said. But she also acknowledged the situation was becoming riskier.\n\n\"They weren't like this at the start of the war,\" she said. \"In this one year, they've escalated more than in all the years before.\"\n\nOne man has been arrested in connection with her assault. Arrests like this are rare, and convictions rarer still. The Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din found that, over the past two decades, more than 93% of police investigations into Israeli offences against Palestinians in the West Bank were closed with no charges filed.\n\nIsraeli forces have long been criticised by human rights groups for standing idly by during settler attacks - or even taking part in them.\n\nThis week, Israel's chief of staff said he strongly condemned the recent violence by Israeli settlers, calling it \"a red line\" and promising to \"act decisively\".\n\nThe head of the army's central command, Maj Gen Avi Bluth - the man addressed in the graffiti on Hamida Mosque - said violent acts by what he called \"anarchist fringe youth\" were \"unacceptable and extremely serious\" and must be dealt with firmly.\n\nSome hardline settlers see these comments as a betrayal.\n\nAmichai Luria, a long-time settler from Ma'ale Levona and manager of a winery in the nearby settlement of Shiloh, told me the current focus on settler violence was overblown.\n\n\"It's amazing to me how people talk about these rare occasions [when] people misbehave,\" he said. \"Oh, some people were trying to pick olives and some Jews came and bothered them. Give me a break. There are more muggings on the main street in London than there [are] here.\"\n\nI asked him about the severe beating of women and the near-daily reports of incidents in surrounding areas. He dismissed them as an \"attempt to make the Jews look bad\".\n\n\"Most of the Arabs, if they could, would follow Hamas or Hezbollah. Very, very, very few want to coexist or live in peace, and at the first opportunity they have, they're going to wipe us out,\" he said.\n\n\"The future is very simple. Hopefully the army will wake up, hopefully people will understand that we have to prepare ourselves, that they're coming for us.\"\n\nThe UN's Office of Humanitarian Affairs says that, of the 1,000 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since the Gaza War began, between 20 and 32 were killed by Israeli settlers. During the same period, it says, Palestinians killed 19 Israeli civilians.\n\nThe decision of military leaders to order action on settler violence will test discipline in an army where settlers make up a growing proportion of troops.\n\nIt also risks exposing dangerous divisions between Israel's military and political leaders.\n\nExtremist settlers say their claim to the land comes from the Bible - but their growing confidence comes from government support.\n\nSince the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and the Gaza War that followed, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has handed out more than 100,000 weapons to civilian security squads, including in West Bank settlements, and has urged Israel to formally annex the West Bank.\n\nThe government has authorised a sharp expansion of settlements, and legalised some unauthorised outposts. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n\nAnd the Defence Minister, Israel Katz, last year banned the use of administrative detention for Jewish settlers in the West Bank - reportedly against the advice of Israel's national security agency.\n\nIsrael's army is now asking Katz to reinstate that power to help curb settler violence.  Administrative detention, which allows suspects to be held for renewable six month periods without charge, is still widely used for Palestinians.\n\n\"I don't trust the army like I used to,\" Amichai Lurai told me. \"A lot of people in the army are anti-Israel from top to bottom. Trust me, the army is not unified.\"\n\nIsrael's army is currently embroiled in a legal and political scandal around  leaked video footage  allegedly showing the abuse of Palestinian detainees - a case that has pitted ultranationalist politicians against the country's security forces.\n\nAs worshippers left the Hamida Mosque after Friday prayers, Israeli activists arrived on a visit to show solidarity.  Martin Goldberg, originally from London, was one of them.\n\nI asked him about Israeli claims that attacks by settlers were overblown.\n\n\"They're very minor attacks, when it's not happening to you,\" he said. \"These attacks are not minor, they're extremely major. Everyone's trying to belittle it, [saying] oh it's just the 'weeds in the field' but it's not. And they're being supported by the government. Local councils are 100% behind them, financing them.\"\n\nMany local councils provide backing and support to outposts, but have publicly condemned the violence of some settlers there. The chairman of the West Bank Settler Council this week issued a statement supporting the Israeli army in arresting the \"anarchists\" who harmed soldiers and civilians.\n\n\"Europe, the United States, everyone in the whole world is watching the West Bank,\" said Wadi abu Awad, a civil engineer who lives in the nearby village of Turmus Aya, which has seen repeated attacks.\n\n\"We are not in a fight with the Israelis. We don't kill Israeli soldiers, we don't have any hostages. And they [settlers] are pushing us towards the corner. You know, if the cat is pushed the corner, he might become a tiger.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jd4elgwzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:24:51Z","title":"Sudan conflict: Mass killings investigation gets green light from UN","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN Human Rights Council has approved a new, independent investigation into mass killings in el-Fasher, Sudan, following two years of civil war that has killed over 150,000 people and displaced 12 million.

a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher.\n\n\"Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,\" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday.\n\nSince the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes.\n\nThe new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher.\n\nThe findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court.\n\nWhile Türk did warn individuals and companies  \"fuelling and profiting\" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict.\n\nThe UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army.\n\nPlus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry.\n\nEl-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies.\n\nThe RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied.\n\nOne gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\"The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,\" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades.\n\nThe scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed.\n\nBack then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\"[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,\" she said.\n\nA joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered \"the world's largest humanitarian crisis\".\n\nIt follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations.\n\nThe US is one of the so-called \"Quad\" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule.\n\nRubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: \"We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved.\"\n\nThe UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by \"the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher\" and accused the Sudanese army of \"starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons\". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected.\n\nA furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called \"all biased statements against them\" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce.\n\nThe RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal.\n\nIn the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting.\n\nOnly a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth  are visible from space in satellite imagery .\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Türk said: \"There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action\" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war.\n\n\"It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.\"\n\nThe flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts.\n\nAmnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan.\n\nThe smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur -  according to a leaked report by UN experts .\n\nThe UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF \"isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it\".\n\nHe also said he did not want to \"diminish\" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying \"that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side\", meaning to the Sudanese army.\n\nAll parties deny these allegations.\n\nA fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities.\n\nIn response to one MP's demand to \"end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF\", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: \"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously.\"\n\nThere has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Bateman\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvel2gvqeqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"10:04:06.319+00:00","title":"Kashmir blast: Nine killed in accidental explosion at police station in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An accidental explosion at the Nowgam police station in Indian-administered Kashmir killed nine people and injured 32, following the transport of confiscated explosives seized from Faridabad, Haryana.

world's \"first drone war\". It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine.\n\nBefore Russia's invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements.\n\nNow, she makes drones for use against the Russians.\n\n\"It was just an obvious decision for me,\" she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. \"I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military.\"\n\nMs Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed.\n\n\"I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones,\" she recalled. \"So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them.\"\n\nThese days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon.\n\nCombat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact.\n\nBefore 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones.\n\n\"This has been the first full-blown drone war,\" says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare.\n\n\"There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They've become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians.\"\n\nAnd not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan.\n\n\"You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power.\" Ms Pettyjohn says.\n\nThe world's biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has  soared more than four-fold  since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Europe, Portugal's Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany's Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due  to open a new factory  in Swindon in southwest England at the end of November.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be  spending £4.5bn  on new military drones.\n\n\"The sector is growing really quickly,\" said Mike Armstrong, Stark's managing director for the UK. \"I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we've seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon.\"\n\nThe growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down.\n\nAnti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport.\n\nOleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company.\n\n\"We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones,\" he says.\n\nSince 2022, DroneShield's share price has  soared 15-fold.  \"We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us,\" Mr Vornik adds.\n\nAs well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China's use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs.\n\nMunin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army.\n\n\"We're building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones,\" he says. \"It's a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it's coming in.\"\n\nExperts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAt the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger.\n\nBut Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. \"That is going to be the next real shift.\n\n\"Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate.\"\n\nIn the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line.\n\n\"I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course,\" she says. \"A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers.\n\n\"But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c797032ldp5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"22:54:13.259+00:00","title":"Screen Actors Guild Awards changes name from SAG to The Actor Awards","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Screen Actors Guild Awards are being rebranded as the Actor Awards, in alignment with the merged union Sag-Aftra, which combines SAG and Aftra.

Anna's joint. He was the pregnant sheila's hubby. Like his missus, he was pretty good looking himself.\"\n\nThose lines are straight from a new translation of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War & Peace, set in the world of Russian high society in the early 19th century.\n\nExcept this is a \"bogan\" version translated by Ander Louis, the pen name of a Melbourne IT worker who moonlights as a writer.\n\nHe's poured a metaphorical can of Australian beer over the novel by converting Tolstoy's prose into a lingo that wouldn't sound out of place in the popular Aussie sitcom Kath & Kim.\n\n\"It's how you'd tell it down the pub,\" Louis, whose real name is Andrew Tesoriero, told the BBC.\n\nThe 39-year-old started the project in 2018 as a joke, turning Russian princesses into \"sheilas\" and princes into \"drongos\", but is now on the cusp of signing a book deal.\n\n\"The number one reason I started doing it was to make me laugh, and I thought if it's making me laugh, maybe other people will too so let's put it out into the world.\"\n\nBogan, a term which first emerged in Australia in the 1980s, initially meant an \"unsophisticated and uncultured person\" with negative connotations, but not for Louis.\n\n\"I've never really thought of it as an insult, more a term of endearment,\" he says.\n\nAnd his version of the Russian literary masterpiece - which starts with the phrase \"bloody hell\" - is about being flippant and irreverent.\n\n\"It's just a good exclamation of surprise,\" Louis jokes.\n\nElsewhere, a noble is a fair dinkum, while the death of an important character is announced by \"he's cactus\".\n\n\"It changes the tone quite significantly,\" Louis laughs.\n\nFor years, Louis avoided picking up War & Peace, set during the Napoleonic wars of the early 1800s, given its heft.\n\nThe novel is divided into 15 books as well as an epilogue, which itself is split into two parts. With more than 1,200 pages to plough through, it's often regarded as the Everest of literature with prose as insurmountable as the famed peak.\n\nBut in 2016, Louis joined an online community where participants pledge to finish the book in a year by reading at least one chapter – there are 361 – every day.\n\nHe loved it so much, he did it twice.\n\n\"I became a bit of an accidental expert,\" he tells the BBC from Lilydale, on the outskirts of Melbourne.\n\nDuring this time, the part-time indie author was writing a novel with dark psychological themes so to lighten the mood, he started making War & Peace irreverent and funny.\n\nAnd for more than six years, Louis' project remained a little-known hobby he did in his spare time, self-publishing the first two translated books of War & Peace and selling a handful of copies.\n\nThat all changed earlier this year when a New York-based tech writer stumbled across the bogan version, posting excerpts from Louis' book in which he describes Napoleon as an \"alright bloke\", the high-ranking Prince Vasili as \"a pretty big deal\" and Princess Bolkónskaya as \"smoking hot\".\n\n\"Out of nowhere, it just went berserk. Overnight, I sold 50 copies,\" Louis says.\n\nThe father-of-two thinks the US interest in his bogan translation might be due to a \"Bluey effect\" given the popular Australian children's cartoon has been the most streamed show in the US for almost two years.\n\n\"Aussie-isms are in vogue over there at the moment\".\n\nAt first glance Tolstoy's book, filled with the lives of rich, powerful Russians, seems worlds apart from modern-day Australia.\n\nBut Louis argues bogan is the ultimate equaliser as the informal slang works across the social spectrum, whether it's in Australia or the world of Russian aristocrats.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of different types of bogan,\" Louis says.\n\nMark Gwynn, a senior researcher at the Australian National University, who helps compile the Australian National Dictionary, agrees. \"Bogans can be wealthy, poor, or in the middle so it's more about the way they behave, dress, socialise and talk,\" he says.\n\nHe says in more recent times, the term has also been used affectionately of someone considered a bogan or even in reference to oneself such as the term \"inner bogan\".\n\nAnd speaking \"bogan\" refers to casual speech with lots of local sayings, he says.\n\n\"Most Australians would know if you said 'speaks bogan' or 'bogan Australian' that the language would be highly informal with many slang and colloquial words and phrases, including uniquely Australian ones.\"\n\nBut there's no direct translation for the term in proper English – it's uniquely Australian.\n\n\"Bogans can live in [both] rural and urban areas so they don't equate to hillbillies, bumpkins, yokels, rustics,\" Gwynn says.\n\nNor are bogans the same as rednecks, as they can hold varied political views, while the British term \"chav\" – also typically used in a derogatory way to describe people from a poor background - doesn't apply either.\n\nThose shape-shifting bogan qualities along with Louis' varied resume - kitchen hand, energy analyst, Uber driver, punk rocker, Tokyo resident – makes him \"strangely qualified\" to create a bogan translation.\n\n\"When I'm drawing on voices, it's just quite genuinely from things I've seen and done… through all those different walks of life.\"\n\nCharacters in his bogan version say \"g'day\", friends are \"mates\" and those with questionable ethics are deemed \"shonky\".\n\nBeautiful ladies are \"chicky babes\", with one so beguiling she's \"hot as a tin roof in Alice\" – a nod to the extreme heat of Alice Springs' desert landscape.\n\nOne prince is an \"absolute true-blue legend\" whose vibrant eyes \"blazed like a bushfire\" while another is a \"bit of a yobbo\" who thinks others are \"carrying on like a pack of galahs\".\n\nWhile his version is peppered with plenty of profanity – which the BBC can't publish – part of the appeal is to make the book more accessible.\n\n\"The best feedback I've found is people saying how much easier it is to understand what's going on,\" he says.\n\nLouis likens himself to Pierre, the main protagonist in War & Peace, who represents the \"everyman\" as the illegitimate son of a rich aristocrat who inherits a huge fortune, catapulting him into Russian high society.\n\nHe says he feels like he's the \"bumbling buffoon\" in the \"walled garden that is traditional publishing\" and that he's committed a kind of \"literary heist\".\n\n\"I've leaned over the fence… and just pinched the crown jewel - their most revered book - and taken it down the pub.\"\n\nAnd what would Tolstoy – who, though born a noble, later in life renounced his privileged upbringing and wealth – think of the bogan version?\n\n\"I actually think he would get a kick out it,\" Louis says."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/disney-youtube-tv-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"21:16:52-05:00","title":"Disney and YouTube TV End Blackout","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney and YouTube TV have resolved a 15-day blackout that prevented subscribers from accessing key channels such as ESPN, ABC, 'Good Morning America,' 'Bluey,' and '9-1-1: Nashville.'

2025-11-14T21:16:52-05:00\n\nDisney and YouTube TV have reached a multiyear agreement that will allow channels like ESPN and ABC to return to the Google-owned pay-television service, the companies said on Friday.\n\nThe deal ends a 15-day blackout that prevented YouTube TV’s estimated 10 million customers from viewing programs like “Monday Night Football,” “Bluey,” “Good Morning America,” “Dancing With the Stars” and “9-1-1: Nashville” as the two sides haggled over terms of a new distribution agreement. Those terms, including the exact length of the agreement, were not disclosed.\n\nThe pact was struck in time to avoid alienating viewers who wanted to watch a major Saturday slate of college football, including national draws like Notre Dame and Alabama facing ranked opponents. The popular Dallas Cowboys are scheduled to play on Monday night. As part of the deal, YouTube TV subscribers will receive unlimited access to ESPN’s new flagship streaming service at no additional cost. (Stand-alone subscriptions to the ESPN app run $30 month.)\n\n“We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf,” YouTube TV said in a statement. The company added that Disney-owned channels would return immediately, along with any recordings that subscribers had saved in their libraries.\n\nDisney said in a separate statement that the deal “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.” The statement was attributed to the senior executives Dana Walden, Jimmy Pitaro and Alan Bergman.\n\nThe blackout hurt both sides.\n\nDisney lost $4.3 million a day during the standoff, according to a Morgan Stanley estimate, which took into account viewership declines. (Still, Hugh Johnston, Disney’s chief financial officer, had said in a CNBC interview on Thursday that his company was ready to continue fighting YouTube TV for “as long as they want.”)\n\nYouTube TV offered customers a $20 credit, but many angry customers dropped the service anyway.\n\nThe two media giants had clashed over fees. Disney wanted YouTube TV to pay more for access to ESPN and other channels, in part to offset higher costs for sports rights. YouTube TV balked, saying the proposed terms would force it to raise prices.\n\nThese so-called carriage disputes are not uncommon in the television business, which has been roiled by streaming over the past decade. But the spat between Disney and YouTube grew particularly acrimonious.\n\nDisney publicly accused YouTube TV of using its clout “to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor.” YouTube fired back, accusing Disney of maneuvering to prop up competing pay-television services — notably Hulu + Live TV and Fubo, both of which Disney owns.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/weather/california-rain-flood-storm-los-angeles-forecast.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:57:49-05:00","title":"The Heaviest Rain Is Yet to Come for Southern Californians Facing a Very Wet Storm","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Southern California is facing an intense storm system driven by an atmospheric river pulling moisture from the Pacific Ocean.

Californians Facing a Very Wet Storm\n\nPublished: 2025-11-14T16:57:49-05:00\n\nSome residents of Southern California were under evacuation warnings on Friday as an unusually strong storm system moved through the region, bringing with it a risk for flash flooding and landslides in areas recently burned by wildfires. The wet storm brought an initial soaking of rain earlier on Friday.\n\nBut the worst is yet to come. On Saturday, forecasters expect heavier rain to raise the risk of flash flooding as the system pulls in additional moisture off the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPrecipitation intensity\n\n“The atmosphere is going to be juicier on Saturday,” said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office serving the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe Weather Service warned that the rain and strong winds will probably result in travel delays at airports, rockslides and mudslides on canyon roads, flooded roads, and swollen rivers and creeks. The weather could also potentially cause dangerous debris flows, a type of landslide that occurs when torrents of water and mud move down steep slopes.\n\nBurn scars are especially prone to debris flows, and some Los Angeles County residents, including those in areas that were burned during the Palisades and Eaton fires in January, were under evacuation warnings until Sunday. (A warning means that people should be prepared to leave quickly.) Some parts of Ventura County were also under evacuation warnings, including in the area burned by the Mountain fire late last year.\n\nThis system has two acts. The first occurred Thursday night into Friday afternoon, with Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties receiving a few inches of rain, and mostly light rain falling in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAct 2 is expected to be more significant. It was to begin late Friday night and continue through Saturday, when the most severe weather is forecast. That includes heavy rain and potentially thunderstorms that could cause flooding.\n\nEven on Friday morning, the exact details of Saturday’s forecast remained uncertain, as they have for much of this week. David Gomberg, a Weather Service meteorologist, said that the storm was pulling in a narrow band of moisture known as an atmospheric river off the Pacific Ocean. It was still unclear where that moisture would hit.\n\n“We think it will set up somewhere between San Bernardino County and Ventura County,” Mr. Gomberg said.\n\nIt is unusual for meteorologists to have this much uncertainty about a storm’s path. Mr. Gomberg said that as Friday progressed, the storm’s geographic range was likely to shrink, with the moisture’s target becoming clearer.\n\nPrecipitation will probably fall across all of Southern California through Sunday, with snow in the mountains at elevations above 8,000 feet and rain falling from the inland deserts to the coast. The most precipitation is expected at the coast.\n\nSanta Barbara County to Los Angeles County: Meteorologists said the highest rainfall totals were probable here, with three to four inches of rain in coastal and valley areas and four to eight inches in the mountains. Downtown Los Angeles could face three and a half to four inches of rain.\n\nThunderstorms could drop sudden bursts of especially heavy rain that would increase those totals in isolated spots, Mr. Thompson said.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the heaviest rain is predicted to start before sunrise on Saturday morning and continue throughout the day.\n\nOrange County to San Diego County: Rainfall totals are forecast to range from one and a half inches to three inches across coastal and valley areas and four to six inches in the mountains, with the highest totals likely in Orange and San Bernardino Counties and the lowest in San Diego County.\n\nSan Diego will see its heaviest rainfall early Saturday morning and in the afternoon, with the downtown area likely to record around two inches.\n\nThunderstorms could also bump up totals in some locations.\n\nCurrent areas because of fires or rain\n\nEvacuation order\n\nEvacuation warning\n\nHistorical fire perimeter\n\nSource: Cal Fire\n\nData as of Invalid Date Pacific time. Historical fire data is shown for the years 2019-2025 and is as of Nov. 13, 2025.\n\nBy William B. Davis and Joey K. Lee\n\nThe coastal mountains of Southern California, from the Santa Monica Mountains to the San Bernardino Mountains, are perfectly oriented to wring the moisture out of the atmospheric river and produce heavy rain.\n\n“The moisture will hit those mountains dead on,” said Park Williams, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Those mountains act as a wall, and the water slides down the mountains and then it goes into the city.”\n\nIn one chain of events, the heavy rain pouring down the mountains and into the urban areas will cause traffic delays on roads, scattered flash flooding, and minor mudslides and debris flows.\n\nIf the system aligns over Los Angeles County on Saturday and stalls over the region for a prolonged period of time, it could cause dangerous debris flows in the burn scars from the Palisades and Eaton fires and others from recent years.\n\nBurn scars are susceptible to debris flows from heavy rain because wildfire flames have destroyed the vegetation and cooked the soil. The debris flows start as a flood that picks up sediment as it moves quickly across a hardened landscape without any vegetation to stop it.\n\n"}]}
