As  French police , government officials and top executives at the  Louvre Museum  continue to scratch their heads over how thieves managed to brazenly steal priceless jewelry in broad daylight, a German company is seizing the moment and grabbing its 15 minutes of fame.\n \n\n   \n  Böcker, the firm that manufactured the furniture lift apparently   used in the audacious robbery, has taken to social media to show there is no such thing as bad publicity.\n \n\n   \n  In a tongue-in-cheek  Instagram  post, the company, based in Werne, northwestern Germany, posted   an image of the scene following the incident and captioned it: “”The next time you need things to move quickly. The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42 meters per minute – whisper-quiet thanks to 230 V E-motor.”\n \n\n   \n  The unidentified thieves, who remain at large, made off with historic jewels worth more than $100 million after breaking into the world-famous Paris museum in broad daylight on Sunday morning, when the museum was already open to visitors. Video footage appears to show that they entered through a second-floor balcony after gaining access with a truck fitted with the lift.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander Böcker, the German company’s managing director and third-generation owner, told CNN in a statement that he and his wife were “shocked” when they first saw the news on Sunday and realized “that our lift had been misused for this robbery.”\n \n\n   \n  Then, once it became clear that nobody had been injured, the business owner’s entrepreneurial spirit kicked in.\n \n\n   \n  “Once the initial shock had subsided, black humour took over,” he said in the statement. “We joked around a bit, had some fun and came up with some initial slogans.”\n \n\n   \n  The feedback to the company’s post, published on Monday, has been “overwhelming” and mostly positive, according to Böcker.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Reuters, he said: “Luckily for us, most of the people got the humor and know that we are not involved in the robbery and we were very pleased with the reaction so far.”\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, told a French Senate committee hearing on Wednesday that the museum’s aging camera system did not cover the eastern balcony of the Apollo Gallery, where the robbers used an angle grinder to break in.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars told the hearing that the “absolutely obsolete, even absent, technical infrastructure” to monitor the country’s most valuable treasures was a “terrible observation” for the world’s largest museum. She said she had offered her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati after the robbery, but it was rejected.\n \n\n   \n  According to Böcker, the Agilo is mainly used in construction and to transport heavy goods during removals and is not meant to transport people.\n \n\n   \n  The specific model used in the heist was sold to a customer in the Greater Paris area who rents it out, according to Böcker’s statement. But it was apparently stolen from the owner during a demonstration for a prospective customer.\n \n\n   \n  “It appears that the company lettering has been removed and the number plates replaced,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/football-nfl-week-8-chargers-vikings-tnf-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:20:00-04:00","title":"Jim Harbaugh Joins Historic Club with Big Win Over Minnesota Vikings on Thursday Night Football","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh achieved a historic milestone by becoming the second person in NFL history to reach 60 wins as both a starting quarterback and head coach, joining Norm Van Brocklin.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers head coach  Jim Harbaugh  joined a historic club after his team comfortably beat the Minnesota Vikings 37-10 on Thursday Night Football.\n \n\n   \n  Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert threw three touchdowns and running back Kimani Vidal rushed for over 100 yards and another score as LA dispatched the Vikings.\n \n\n   \n  With the victory, Harbaugh became just the second person in NFL history to earn 60 wins as both a starting quarterback and head coach. He joins Norm Van Brocklin as the only people to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  Harbaugh had a 66-74 record over a 13-year playing career in the  NFL  which included stints with the Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Baltimore Ravens and the then named San Diego Chargers.\n \n\n   \n  As a head coach, he compiled a 44-19-1 record with the San Francisco 49ers between 2011 and 2014 and Thursday’s victory improves his record with the Chargers to 16-9 in his two seasons back in California.\n \n\n   \n  The win over Minnesota at SoFi Stadium helps get the Chargers’ season back on track after the team lost three of their last four.\n \n\n   \n  The game began strongly for the home team, with LA leading 21-3 at halftime with three touchdown drives in the first two quarters.\n \n\n   \n  The Vikings got their only touchdown of the game with 4:36 left in the third quarter when back-up  quarterback  Carson Wentz connected with Jordan Addison to reduce LA’s lead to 14 points.\n \n\n   \n  But Minnesota failed to score again after that and the Chargers added 13-straight points to close out the victory and improve to 5-3.\n \n\n   \n  Herbert finished the game 18-of-25 passing for 227 yards, three TDs and one interception, while also running for 62 yards.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , it was Herbert’s third game of his NFL career with three-plus touchdown passes and more than 50 yards rushing, something no other quarterback in Chargers history has ever done.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Harbaugh was effusive in his praise of his star QB.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just another thing about Justin Herbert that I don’t know how he does it,” Harbaugh told reporters. “It’s nothing but respect.\n \n\n   \n  “To be able to actually throw an interception and then come back the next drive – that’s the great ones who can do that. The great, great ones. Just measure what they do after something goes bad, after there’s an interception. That’s the worst thing that can really happen to you as a quarterback. And then chart what they do with the next drive. That shakes a lot of guys. Not Justin Herbert, not the great ones, back right down the field. … It’s incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  For the Vikings, they slip to 3-4 and continue to struggle on offense with starting QB JJ McCarthy still sidelined with an ankle injury.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s replacement, Wentz, came into the game nursing a shoulder knock and looked out of sorts all evening as he made his fifth straight start for the team.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota had just 164 total yards on offense while the Chargers had 419. LA also dominated the time of possession, having over 39 minutes of the ball while the Vikings had just under 21 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Wentz’s interception midway through the fourth quarter halted any slim hopes Minnesota might have had about a  dramatic comeback . And with the team’s playoffs hopes on the line, the return of McCarthy – who was the emergency third QB on Thursday – is expected before their Week 9 game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  The only bright spot for the Vikings on Thursday was their star wide receiver Justin Jefferson having his own moment of history. Jefferson joined Hall of Famer Randy Moss (8,375 yards) and Torry Holt (8,156) as the only players with at least 8,000 receiving yards in their first six seasons in NFL history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-ends-trade-negotiations-canada","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:46:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he’s ending Canada trade negotiations over anti-tariff ad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump terminated U.S.-Canada trade negotiations in response to an advertisement from Ontario Premier Doug Ford that featured a clip from a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan, which was misrepresented to suggest Reagan opposed tariffs.

But Reagan was clear: he was “loath” to take that action and believed high tariffs had exacerbated the Great Depression.\n \n\n   \n  Yet by Thursday night, Trump had taken to social media to blast the ad.\n \n\n   \n  “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” he wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  He claimed the ad aimed to “interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,” and defended tariffs as critical to the US economy and national security.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate Truth Social post  Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,” Trump posted. “Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s office for comment, as well as the office of Dominic LeBlanc, the minister overseeing US-Canada trade.\n \n\n   \n  Ontario Premier Doug Ford had first posted the ad online on October 16, writing in a caption: “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.”\n \n\n   \n  A disclaimer under the ad states that it was not approved or sponsored by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library or the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Along with its statement, the Ronald Reagan Foundation offered a link to the full unabridged version of Reagan’s decades-old speech — in which he speaks at greater length about why he opposes tariffs. “More than five million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business, and additional millions are tied to imports,” he said in one quote, which was not included in the ad.\n \n\n   \n  The description for the full YouTube video lists the speech as “unrestricted” in both access and use.\n \n\n   \n    Growing tension\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump took office, the centuries-long friendship between the US and Canada has  broken down  amid  bruised feelings  over tariffs and Trump’s  threat to make Canada the 51st US state . Many Canadians are boycotting American goods, and refusing to travel to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Canada has long been one of the US’ top trading partners; last year, the US imported $411.9 billion worth of goods from Canada, according to government figures.\n \n\n   \n  But Canada’s economy has been hit hard by Trump’s steep sectoral tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum, lumber, and energy — some of the country’s key exports to the US. Those fall under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump brokered during his first term and will be under mandatory review next year. Canada’s unemployment rate is now at its highest point in nine years.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the last thing that either country needs,” Jack Buffington, director of the supply chain program at the University of Denver, told CNN after Trump’s announcement. “We need to stabilize the North American supply chain, particularly given the challenges that the US has with China.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney won an election in April with a strident message for Canadians, warning that their relationship with America would change dramatically in the coming years. He has fostered relationships with other Western countries instead; on Thursday, before Trump’s post, he had announced on X that Canada plans to double its non-US exports in the next decade.\n \n\n   \n  “Our core mission is to build a stronger economy — one that doesn’t rely on a single trade partner,” he wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  The economic relationship has reached a boiling point several times over the course of Trump’s second term. Earlier this year, in the relationship’s tensest moment, Ford threatened to halt exports of Canadian electricity to the United States, which would have sent US energy bills surging. But he ultimately backed off that threat. Trump has also threatened to call off talks with Canada in the past, only to restore negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions have eased slightly in recent months, however, with  Carney meeting Trump  at the Oval Office earlier this month. There, Trump joked about a “merger” of the two countries but also praised his counterpart as a “world-class leader.”\n \n\n   \n  LeBlanc, the Canadian trade minister, said negotiators for both countries had left with directions to “quickly land deals” on steel, aluminum and energy.

\n       \n  By David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:50 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has  canceled trade negotiations with Canada  over what he called a “ fake ” ad that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech delivered by conservative hero and former President Ronald Reagan. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute also said the ad misrepresented the former president’s words.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t fake. It was edited. But Reagan really did spend a  five-minute speech  — an April 25, 1987, national radio address that the Reagan Library has published on  YouTube  — railing against tariffs. It was a full-throated expression of support for free and fair trade.\n \n\n   \n  The ad, purchased by the government of Ontario and broadcast on major US television networks, aired clips of the address, delivered from Camp David, where Reagan was soon to meet the prime minister of Japan at a time when American attitudes toward Japan were hardening. In the recent past, Japanese companies like Toyota and Sony had flooded America’s market with high quality but inexpensive cars and electronics, harming the business of great American brands, including General Motors and RCA.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before delivering the radio address, Reagan had placed higher tariffs on various Japanese products in retaliation for the influx of cheap Japanese semiconductors to America. He had some harsh words for Japan – not included in the ad – criticizing it in terms that resembled Trump’s frequent trade missives.\n \n\n   \n  “We had clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices that violated an agreement between Japan and the United States,” Reagan said. “We expect our trading partners to live up to their agreements.”\n \n\n   \n  Reagan said he would remove the tariffs only when there was evidence Japan was treating American businesses and workers fairly – also seemingly channeling one of Trump’s go-to lines.\n \n\n   \n  But Reagan was clear: He was “loath” to place trade barriers on Japan and believed high tariffs were damaging to American workers and the economy. He noted that economists widely believe that high tariffs of the  Smoot-Hawley era  had exacerbated the Great Depression, which he and others of his generation lived through – a painful memory that, he said, remained “deep and searing.”\n \n\n   \n  The bulk of Reagan’s address – and the part the ad drew from most heavily – was his description of why advanced economies had largely abandoned tariffs as an economic tool by the time he became president: They increase domestic companies’ reliance on government intervention, they reduce competition, they kick off trade wars that lead to more tariffs, they raise prices and they ultimately  lead to job losses .\n \n\n   \n  Reagan then criticizes the Democratic-controlled Congress for proposing legislation that could place more trade barriers on other countries. And, despite “certain select cases like the Japanese semiconductors,” Reagan said his administration had embraced free trade.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear why Trump called the ad “fake,” but his  Truth Social post  included a critical message about the ad  posted online  by The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute. It said the ad campaign used “selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan” and “misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.” The foundation didn’t say what it believed to be misrepresented.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate Truth Social post  Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,” Trump posted. “Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ronald Reagan Foundation & Institute also claimed the government of Ontario didn’t seek permission to use or edit Reagan’s speech, although it’s not clear it was legally required to. The foundation said it was reviewing its legal options and encouraged people to  watch the unedited speech .\n \n\n   \n  The ad has run many times during high-profile events, including during the American League Championship series that featured the Toronto Blue Jays. Starting Friday night, the Ontario-based team will play in the World Series – a great source of national pride for Canadians.\n \n\n   \n  Ontario Premier Doug Ford in a  speech  on October 14 said his government had placed the ad on virtually every major US network because he wanted to “take Ronald Reagan’s words and let’s blast it to the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad,” Ford said. “It’s very factual. And coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”\n \n\n   \n  “He was just the best president America has ever seen in my opinion,” Ford, a conservative politician, said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/athletics-ruth-chepngetich-marathon-doping-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:07:00-04:00","title":"Marathon record holder Ruth Chepngetich given three-year ban for doping violation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ruth Chepngetich, the women's marathon world record holder and three-time Chicago Marathon winner, has been banned for three years after testing positive for the banned diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in a sample collected on March 14, 2025.

Anti-Doping Agency , diuretics like HCTZ can be used to flush previously taken prohibited substances out of an athlete’s system.\n \n\n   \n  The three-year ban, which was reduced from four years after Chepngetich admitted to the doping violation, means that the Kenyan is eligible to compete again in April 2028.\n \n\n   \n  Her results since March 14 have also been disqualified, but her

Later that month, Chepngetich wrote to the AIU explaining that she had taken her housemaid’s medication after feeling unwell two days before the positive test, but forgot to disclose this fact to investigators.\n \n\n   \n  However, the AIU stated that this explanation was “hardly credible,” describing it as the sort of “recklessness” that amounts to “indirect intent” and a four-year suspension.\n \n\n   \n  After accepting the sanction within 20 days, Chepngetich’s ban was reduced by a year.\n \n\n   \n  An estimated concentration of 3800ng/ml of HCTZ was found in the positive urine sample from March, exceeding the minimum reporting limit of 20ng/ml.\n \n\n   \n  In early September, Chepngetich wrote to the AIU and said that she had “made a big mistake by taking a medicine and not informing the investigator and the official who were in charge of taking samples,” according to a  decision document  released by the AIU.\n \n\n   \n  “The case regarding the positive test for HCTZ has been resolved, but the AIU will continue to investigate the suspicious material recovered from Chepng’etich’s phone to determine if any other violations have occurred,” said Brett Clothier, head of the AIU.\n \n\n   \n  AIU chair David Howman, meanwhile, said that this case highlights how “nobody is above the rules” when it comes to doping violations.\n \n\n   \n  The

\n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  They were faces of the Democratic resistance, a winning piece of the blue wave, when the party  swept control  of the House of Representatives in 2018 as a fierce reaction to President Donald Trump’s first two years in office.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill are seeking to spur another Democratic revival. Their respective races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey  offer potential lessons  for the party as it tries to rise from political exile and find a pathway back to power.\n \n\n   \n  “What we will do this November is not just vote against something, but we will vote for the policies that we believe in,” Spanberger told a crowded rally here this week. “Are you ready to win?”\n \n\n   \n  A year after losing the White House and failing to win control of Congress, Democrats are working to move beyond the  soul-searching  and finger-pointing phase of their 2024 defeat. The November 4 elections are the latest test of the party’s efforts to rebuild, rebrand and rebound in the new Trump era.\n \n\n   \n  “This one’s too important,” Sherrill told supporters on a recent night, hoping to impress upon them the urgency of the moment. “Make sure no one sits this out.”\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey and Virginia are the only states in the country that elect governors the year after a presidential campaign. The races could hold lessons for Democrats as they seek to unify their fraying coalitions, try to win over any disillusioned Trump voters and recruit candidates for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Yet those races are only one chapter of the Democratic Party’s fight.\n \n\n   \n  An epic generational and ideological clash is unfolding in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani is working to take command in a mayoral race with Andrew Cuomo. The spirited campaign has shined a light on the risks and rewards for a party still reconciling its identity and finding the best approach to address the affordability crisis and other challenges facing Americans.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the blue wave\n \n\n   \n  It was 2018 when Spanberger, a former federal agent and CIA officer, was elected to a Congressional seat in central Virginia long held by Republicans. Her national security credentials and more centrist views appealed to suburban voters turned off by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  She once  confronted  progressive members of her own party in a private call, admonishing them “to not ever use the words ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again.” She won hard-fought re-election battles before stepping down at the end of her third term to focus on her run for governor.\n \n\n   \n  Her biography and a lifelong commitment to service is at the center of her bid for governor, where polls show she is leading Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Top Democrats have flocked to Virginia, eager to highlight Spanberger as a broader example for where the party stands.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything about her turns the GOP narrative about who Democrats are upside down,” Pete Buttigieg, a former Democratic presidential candidate and transportation secretary, said as he rallied Spanberger’s supporters here. “This is what the mainstream actually looks like.”\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Sherrill was also part of the class of Democratic candidates in 2018 whose  national security credentials  were at the heart of their quest to win seats once held by Republicans. Her advertising campaign is built around her training as a pilot, with images of her flying a helicopter saying: “The Navy taught me in a crisis you either find a way or make one.”\n \n\n   \n  Locked in a particularly fierce fight in the closing days of the race, Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli has called out Sherrill’s frequent references to her military service. He minced few words to one crowd last week, saying: “She’ll tell you she knows how to fly a helicopter, but she doesn’t know a damn thing about running the state of New Jersey.”\n \n\n   \n    Capitol Hill roommates\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, and Sherrill, 53, forged a friendship after arriving on Capitol Hill. They became roommates and still have a running conversation about their respective races and how both could become the first Democratic female governor of their state. (The winner between Spanberger and Earle-Sears will make history as Virginia’s first female governor.)\n \n\n   \n  They’ve often talked about their common bonds, including how Spanberger was born in New Jersey and moved to Virginia at age 13, while Sherrill was born in Virginia and moved to New Jersey as an adult.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s somebody who comes from that national service background like I do. Someone who’s a mom, like I am. She has three kids, I have four,” Sherrill said in an interview. “I don’t think either of us thought we were going to run for office until in 2018 we felt called to serve again and have been in it ever since.”\n \n\n   \n  They’ve also adopted similar approaches in their campaign by intentionally avoiding trying to add their voice to every Democratic criticism about Trump, but instead focusing on the  tangible effects  of Trump’s policies and whether he has lived up to promises made a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  “He told people he would drive down their costs. I think a lot of people feel very let down,” Sherrill said. “As he’s raising their costs, he’s making billions of dollars. That is really speaking to people who say this is not some guy who has my interest at heart.”\n \n\n   \n  For all the similar strains of their candidacies, their challenges are quite distinct.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill is seeking to replace Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has been in office for eight years. Not since 1961 have Democrats won three consecutive elections as governor.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger is running to replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, which offers a far simpler case to make an argument for change.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Too many people to please’\n \n\n   \n  As the fall campaign heads into the home stretch, more than a dozen Democratic voters in Virginia and New Jersey told CNN they feel hopeful the party is starting to gain confidence and find its footing one year after a punishing loss that sent Trump back to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “It will rebuild itself. It just takes time,” said Barbara Lee, a retiree from Staunton, Virginia, who waited in line to see Spanberger at the Jefferson Theater in Charlottesville. “We need new leadership. Abigail can start us off.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the next breath, Lee echoed the sentiment of other Democrats when she said the party must work to extinguish ideological infighting that she believes runs as hot as ever.\n \n\n   \n  “We just have too many people to please. That’s why it’s so hard for us,” Lee said. “We are being attacked from all areas – not just Republicans – but from our own party. So let’s get that out of the way and we can go on to what’s next.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/science/london-underground-mosquito-debunked-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:42:00-04:00","title":"‘London Underground mosquito’ is actually much older than previously thought","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new genetic study published in Science in 2025 refutes the long-held belief that the 'London Underground mosquito' (Culex pipiens form molestus) evolved in London’s tunnels during World War II.

\n  By Jacopo Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:42 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.\n \n\n   \n  The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.\n \n\n   \n  The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form   molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that  published  Thursday in the journal Science.\n \n\n   \n  In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”\n \n\n   \n    Migrating north\n \n\n   \n  The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.\n \n\n   \n  Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.\n \n\n   \n  In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.\n \n\n   \n  “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”\n \n\n   \n  At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first  described  as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”\n \n\n   \n  This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”\n \n\n   \n  There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.\n \n\n   \n    Mosquito opportunities\n \n\n   \n  Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”\n \n\n   \n  The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.\n \n\n   \n  “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”\n \n\n   \n  Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/royal-lodge-prince-andrew-gbr-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-04:00","title":"Everything we know about Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew’s 30-room mansion in Windsor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Royal Lodge, a 30-room royal estate in Windsor Great Park, has been the residence of Prince Andrew since 2003.

   \nUpdated: \n        6:46 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the scandal surrounding Britain’s  Prince Andrew  continues to make headlines across the world, many are asking whether the disgraced royal will be able to continue living in Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003.\n \n\n   \n  But how much do we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years?\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property back in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, due to expire on June 15, 2078, he is expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/who-gets-paid-during-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Here’s who’s getting paid — and who isn’t — during the federal government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal workers face unpaid or furloughed status, while lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, federal judges, and certain appointed officials continue to receive pay under constitutional provisions.

who’s getting paid — and who isn’t — during the federal government shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the government shutdown, with more than 1 million of them  going unpaid  while Democrats and Republicans in Congress argue over funding federal agencies for the current fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  Many will miss their first full paychecks on Friday, while others will feel the loss early next week, depending on their agency.\n \n\n   \n  But lawmakers on Capitol Hill will still collect their paychecks during the impasse, which began October 1, with no end in sight. They continue to receive their salaries, as directed by the  Constitution  – although some have said they wouldn’t accept their pay or will donate the money.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically fall unevenly on those who work for the federal government. And this time, President Donald Trump is taking additional steps to shield — at least temporarily — certain employees and the  military  from the financial pain, even as he threatens that hundreds of thousands of other staffers may never receive the  back pay  guaranteed to them under a 2019 law that he signed.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked a GOP-led bill to  pay workers who are deemed essential  during the shutdown. Many Democrats have said they want to pass a bill that also pays furloughed federal employees, though Republicans on Thursday rejected their alternatives. But some Republicans and Democrats have expressed optimism that there could be a bipartisan deal on a compromise measure.\n \n\n   \n  With many federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, missing even one can be financially devastating. Scores of federal employees have written to CNN about the economic toll the shutdown is taking on them and their families, leaving them at risk of losing their homes or cars or making it difficult for them to feed and provide for their families.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who gets paid\n \n\n   \n  In addition to lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and federal judges will still receive their paychecks, thanks to the Constitution. So will political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate, along with certain other appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Also, roughly 830,000 federal workers are continuing to be paid during the impasse, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of shutdown contingency plans filed by agencies. That’s because their compensation doesn’t rely on annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, they are paid through other spending packages, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, through fees or through other resources.\n \n\n   \n  Only days before the roughly 2 million active-duty and reserve members of the military were set to  miss their first paychecks , the Trump administration announced it would use about $8 billion in Pentagon research and development funds to cover the October 15 payroll. But there isn’t enough money for the next distribution at the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Trump administration has  moved to pay  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, according to Kash Patel, the agency’s director. Plus, 70,000 law enforcement personnel in the  Department of Homeland Security , including in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Secret Service and other divisions will receive their paychecks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  posted on X. \n \n\n   \n  And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is  temporarily recalling  roughly 3,000 furloughed employees amid open enrollment for Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, starting Monday. They will be paid for the time they are working.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who doesn’t get paid\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while another roughly 670,000 have been furloughed, according to the latest estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. However, agencies have made changes as the shutdown drags on. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service originally said it would use the Inflation Reduction Act to keep paying all of its roughly 74,300 employees but a week later decided to  furlough nearly half its workforce .\n \n\n   \n   Senate staffers  learned last week that they will not receive their October 20 paychecks and won’t be paid for the remainder of the shutdown, while the judicial branch announced that it has run out of funding to sustain full operations. Essential staff will stay on the job, working without pay, while other court employees will be furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, federal workers typically received back pay when impasses ended, but Congress made it official in 2019. However, the White House budget office is considering a new interpretation of that law, arguing it doesn’t cover furloughed employees.\n \n\n   \n  Many  federal contractors , including those who handle security, clean offices and staff the cafes in federal buildings, are also laid off during shutdowns. But unlike federal workers, they have no guarantee of being made whole at the end of the impasse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/health/florida-maha-medical-freedom-movement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"At the Hollow in Florida, the ‘medical freedom’ movement finds its base camp","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article documents the rise of a 'medical freedom' movement in Sarasota County, Florida, centered at The Hollow, which combines anti-vaccine ideology, conspiracy theories, and right-wing political activism.

  \n  Source: KFF Health News\n \n   \n  MAGA and MAHA are happily married in Florida, and nowhere more at home than in Sarasota County, where on a humid October night a crowd of several hundred gathered to honor state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, his wife, and an unlicensed Canadian radiologist who treats cancer with horse paste.\n \n\n   \n  The event,  titled “The 3 Big C’s: Courage, Censorship & Cancer ,” was sponsored by the  We the People Health and Wellness Center , a clinic, funded by a Jan. 6 marcher, where patients can bask in red light, sit in ozone-infused steam baths, or get their children treated for autism with an experimental blood concentrate.\n \n\n   \n  In Venice, in Sarasota County, a “medical freedom” movement forged in opposition to covid lockdowns blends wellness advocates, vaccine-haters, right-wing Republicans, and angry parents in a stew of anti-government absolutism and mystical belief.\n \n\n   \n  Ladapo’s wife, Brianna, a self-proclaimed “spiritual healer” who says she speaks with angels and has prophetic visions, chaired a panel at the event at the Venice Community Center. The keynote speech was by William Makis,  a litigious covid conspiracist  who, after losing his medical license in 2019, has made a living treating cancer patients with antiparasitic drugs including ivermectin, which was also championed in some circles as a covid treatment during the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Clinical trials showed that ivermectin didn’t work, but covid skeptics viewed medicine’s rejection of it as part of a conspiracy by Big Pharma against a cheap, off-patent drug. Some of the patients in his care have what he calls “turbo cancers,” Makis says, blaming alleged impurities in mRNA vaccines that he says have killed millions of people.\n \n\n   \n  For Makis, it’s all one big conspiracy — the virus, the vaccine, and the suppression of his therapies.\n \n\n   \n  Brianna Ladapo has her own take on medicine, based on the idea of good and bad spiritual energy. She wrote in a memoir that as the pandemic began she intuited that it had been planned by “sinister forces” to “frighten the masses to surrender their sovereignty to a small group of tyrannical elites.” She has written that the government  hides vaccination’s risks .\n \n\n   \n  She sees “dark forces” all over the place, including, she said  in a podcast interview  earlier this year, in “chemtrails” shaped like a pentagram. “They’ve been plastering it in the sky right outside our house for the last few weeks,” Ladapo said.

Although there is zero evidence of that, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  plans to look into  whether they are part of a clandestine effort to use toxic chemicals to change the weather.)\n \n\n   \n  Ladapo’s husband hasn’t publicly endorsed all her beliefs, but as surgeon general he’s reversing decades of accepted public health practice in Florida and embracing untested therapies. “We’re done with fear,” Joseph Ladapo said after being named surgeon general in 2021. He wants to ban mRNA vaccines in Florida, and on Sept. 3 he announced plans to end childhood vaccination mandates in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A few days after the Venice event, Ladapo  said he hoped  to support Makis’ work — though his treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous — through a new $60 million cancer research fund created by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his wife, Casey.\n \n\n   \n  Vic Mellor, CEO of  a local concrete business , founded and owns We the People. He’s an associate of retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump’s national security adviser in 2017 before being dismissed for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Trump later pardoned him, and Flynn since has become a leader of the Christian nationalist movement.\n \n\n   \n  We the People provides vitamin shots but no vaccines. In fact, many of its offerings are treatments for supposed vaccine injuries. Part of the We the People building is a broadcasting studio, where conservatives hold forth on what they see as the villainy of liberals and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  Mellor was at the U.S. Capitol during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021 — he said he “just knocked on front doors,” according to a Facebook post described  by The Washington Post . He returned home and started building a 10-acre complex that hosts weddings and right-wing assemblies, with playgrounds, a butterfly garden, a zip line over a pond visited by alligators, and an attached, separately owned gun range.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors who travel down a dirt road to The Hollow — named for the hollow-core concrete that made Mellor wealthy — can enter the compound through a dark, cavernous passage lined with neon signs illuminating maxims from the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  The Hollow has hosted clinics for unvaccinated kids and events  for Ladapo , anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny (who in 2021 told legislators at  an Ohio House hearing  that covid vaccine made people magnetic), and other “medical freedom” advocates. Mellor created a medical home for such ideas by  opening We the People  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The year before, three “medical freedom” candidates had won seats on the board overseeing Sarasota’s public hospital and health care system, after protests over the hospital’s refusal to treat covid patients with ivermectin and other drugs of choice for covid contrarians.\n \n\n   \n  On a recent afternoon at The Hollow, manager Dan Welch was clearing brush when approached by KFF Health News. As a foe of vaccinations, he welcomed Ladapo’s move to end vaccine mandates. “Maybe in their inception, vaccines were created to prevent what they were supposed to prevent,” Welch said. “But now there’s so much more in there, the metals, aluminum, mercury. Since they started vaccination, the autism rate went through the roof, and I believe these vaccines are part of it.”\n \n\n   \n  The theory that vaccines cause autism has been debunked, and manufacturers removed mercury from childhood vaccines 24 years ago, although Welch said he doesn’t believe it.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccination faces additional challenges in a century-old Sarasota County neighborhood of low-slung bungalows called Pinecraft, home to about 3,000 Mennonites — and double that number when Amish snowbirds arrive in the winter. Pastor Timothy Miller said that while Sarasota’s Mennonites are less culturally isolated than the Mennonite community in West Texas, site of a measles outbreak in January, many in his community also shun vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  His cousin Kristi Miller, 26, won’t vaccinate her 9-month-old daughter or any of the other children she hopes to have, she said, because she thinks vaccines probably cause autism and other harms.\n \n\n   \n  As for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, she doesn’t worry about them.  Like the Ladapos , “I don’t live in fear,” she said. “I have a God who’s bigger than everything.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/football-ncaa-indiana-resurgence","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"How Indiana Upended Decades of Futility to Become College Football’s Most Unlikely Rising Power","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indiana University football, once one of the most historically unsuccessful programs in college football with over 700 losses and a dismal win record, has undergone a dramatic turnaround under head coach Curt Cignetti.

Inside were six tickets for each of that season’s Indiana University  football  games, free to him as a dorm resident because, to put it bluntly, no one was terribly interested in going to Hoosier football games, let alone paying for them.\n \n\n   \n  It was 1997 and the Hoosiers were terrible. Not that being terrible was unusual. For the better part of its 138-year existence, Indiana football has excelled at being awful.\n \n\n   \n  It owned the record for most losses in  Division I  history (713) and the worst winning percentage in Big Ten history (.421). Prior to last year, only 14 teams in school history had earned a trip to a bowl game and of the then-30 coaches to lead the program, only five left with winning records – just three since the turn of the 20th century and only one, Bo McMillan, since the end of World War II.\n \n\n   \n  In 1976, Lee Corso, who coached the Hoosiers from 1973 to 1982, memorably stopped a game against Ohio State to snap a picture of his entire team under the scoreboard. The Hoosiers had just scored and led the Buckeyes 7-6 – the first lead Indiana held over Ohio State in a quarter century.\n \n\n   \n  “I looked it up. Can you believe it? Twenty-five years! The goal of a lifetime,’’ Corso said after the game, explaining his rationale. Ohio State went on to win the game, 47-7.\n \n\n   \n  Suffice to say, Indiana football was not an afterthought in the state. That would require it to be a thought in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “Being an Indiana football fan felt like being in a very small club that no one wanted to join,’’ Clavio, who is now the associate dean for undergraduate education at the IU Media School and director of the university’s sports media program, told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  This is basketball country, a reality proudly declared at the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame – “in 49 other states, it’s just basketball, but this is Indiana,’’ – which is located in New Castle, home also to the largest high school gym in the world (capacity 9,325) and the Steve Alford All-American Inn, where a gigantic sneaker sits out front of the hotel named after the beloved IU hoopster.\n \n\n   \n  This is where 41,000 people came to watch high school star Damon Bailey play in his state championship game and where, if you ask people about the Wat Shot – Christian Watford’s 2011 buzzer-beating three-pointer against rival Kentucky – they not only know what it is; they know where they were when the ball went in.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers,” remember, might be a nickname for all IU athletes, but in the movie, they measured the height of a basket, not the length of the football field.\n \n\n   \n  As a fourth-generation Hoosier, Clavio was reared on all of this, but his father also was a freshman during IU’s football glory year (singular), back in 1967 when Indiana went to the Rose Bowl (and, for what it’s worth, lost to USC). He regularly took his son to football games, largely because the tickets were cheaper and easier to get than they were for hoops games.\n \n\n   \n  So, as misery-inducing as it was, Clavio regularly attended the football games as an undergrad and long after. When he started working at IU in 2009, he started a podcast, the “ CrimsonCast ,” in which he dissects both football and basketball. Maybe 1,000 listeners tuned in for the fall Sunday postmortems.\n \n\n   \n  Last weekend, after the Hoosiers rocked Michigan State and rose to No. 2 in the Associated Press polls, more than 12,000 people tuned in to Clavio’s podcast. The Hoosiers are a hot topic and more a ridiculously happy one, having won more games (18) in the last season and a half than they amassed in the previous three years combined. After turning its own history on its ear by earning a spot in  the College Football Playoff last year , Indiana is now one of just six undefeated teams left and that No. 2 ranking in the AP poll is a new program best.\n \n\n   \n  The once forlorn small club of football faithful have welcomed a convoy of bandwagon hoppers. This Saturday’s noon ET game against UCLA will mark the eighth consecutive sellout for IU. After the allotted 11,000 student tickets sold out for the first time, athletic director Scott Dolson made more available.\n \n\n   \n  They weren’t free.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Google me’\n \n\n   \n  What is happening at Indiana is not normal, not ever, but certainly not in the revenue-rich era of college football.\n \n\n   \n  To the spenders go the spoils, and while IU as an athletic department wasn’t low rent, it was not keeping up with its peers. According to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database, IU regularly trailed its Big Ten brethren in annual football spending, $12 million shy of the median in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  With the help of deep-pocketed donors, the university has slowly opened its wallet. Two years ago, it finally crafted a football-only weight room and added new suites and this year put down new turf in the stadium. The result: $61.6 million spending in 2024 (a number partially offset by the $15 million owed to former head coach Tom Allen), on par with the rest of the Big Ten.\n \n\n   \n  But if football success was predicated on spending money alone, the Texas Longhorns would never lose a game. For the better part of its existence, Indiana football largely followed the playbook when it came to head coaching hires, either recycling former head coaches who’d been fired (Gerry DiNardo, Sam Wyche) or targeting assistants from other big-name programs (Tom Allen, Kevin Wilson).\n \n\n   \n  In December 2023, after dismissing Tom Allen, Dolson opted to go in another direction, bringing in a wildly successful head coach who made up for what he lacked in name recognition with a history of winning.\n \n\n   \n  Adding in his time at Indiana, Curt Cignetti is 137-37 as a head coach, a pattern of sustained success that ought to merit attention. Except his resume included stops at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, a Division II school; Elon, an FCS school; and James Madison (JMU), which only jumped to the FBS level in 2022. While moving from low- to mid- to high-major is a normal process in college basketball, it’s not regularly done in football.\n \n\n   \n  Fair or not, Indiana was, frankly, the only sort of job the 62-year-old Cignetti was going to get.\n \n\n   \n  In truth when, at a news conference, he provided his now legendary answer to a question about selling his vision to recruits – “It’s pretty simple. I win. Google me.’’ – he was being equal parts badass and honest. People did, in fact, have to Google him.\n \n\n   \n  Dolson did not.\n \n\n   \n    Indiana gets rolling under Cignetti\n \n\n   \n  Dolson grew up in Michigan City, Indiana, closer in proximity to Michigan, Michigan State and Northwestern, but his heart always bled Hoosier red.\n \n\n   \n  At the age of 9, Dolson attended a Bob Knight basketball camp, dreaming of finding a way to join the team. Smart enough to know he couldn’t play for the Hoosiers, he turned his attention to serving as a student manager as an undergrad. In 1987, when Knight and the aforementioned Alford combined to take Indiana to a national title, Dolson was a junior.\n \n\n   \n  The year after he graduated, he joined the athletic department as a part of the Varsity Club and essentially never left.\n \n\n   \n  That long history with the school means he knew well the historic pigskin ineptitude he was battling when, in 2020, he succeeded Fred Glass as AD.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had our ups and downs, and unfortunately a lot more downs,’’ Dolson told CNN Sports. “We always were trying to find consistency and never could.’’\n \n\n   \n  Dolson decided to not merely search for consistency; he opted to research it. He commissioned an in-house study to examine what did and didn’t work at Indiana, as well as consider how other schools with similarly strong basketball histories – Kentucky, Kansas and Duke – had at least made some inroads in football. He looked at everything from budgeting to scheduling to facilities.\n \n\n   \n  He also formed a profile for the sort of coach he needed to succeed. At the top of the list: Someone with successful head-coaching experience. A strong recruiter and smart offensive mind who could develop quarterbacks also mattered, as did a person who appreciated continuity in his staffing.\n \n\n   \n  When Dolson interviewed Cignetti, he found himself mentally ticking off the boxes on his wish list.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti was not blind to what he was walking into. Upon stepping off the plane for his introductory press conference, he sensed the sort of Eeyore gloom pervading Indiana football. It was worse than disappointment; it was disinterest.\n \n\n   \n  So when he was introduced at halftime during a basketball game that day, he hit the Hoosier faithful square in the eyes, finishing his remarks with a literal mic drop by shouting, “Purdue sucks. But so does Michigan and Ohio State. Go IU!”\n \n\n   \n    From unknown to untouchable\n \n\n   \n  The energy and bluster helped but rare is the coach who doesn’t come in promising to win big.\n \n\n   \n  What separated Cignetti was he had a plan to do it.\n \n\n   \n  Often lost in the pursuit of the next head coach is just how hard it is to  be  a head coach. Cignetti has held the job title since 2011. Despite the laundry list of things to do at Indiana, he was not intimidated. He was not confused about what he wanted, or what his team’s identity would be.\n \n\n   \n  Within days of signing his contract, Cignetti reached out to the staff under Allen and asked them to evaluate each of the returning players so that, when he arrived on campus, he could start making decisions. By the end of week one, a stunned Dolson told his wife Heidi, “This thing is already rolling.”\n \n\n   \n  “When you take over a program, but especially football because it’s so big, it can be overwhelming,’’ Dolson said. “Like where do you start? He knew what he wanted, and how he was going to do it from day one. It was, ‘This is what we’re going to do, how we’re going to do it, and we’re not tolerating anything else.’’’\n \n\n   \n  In a way, Cignetti built the Indiana roster in his own image – on the backs of players hungry to prove their worth.\n \n\n   \n  His starting quarterback in 2024, Kurtis Rourke, came from the Group of 5 Mid-American Conference (MAC) member Ohio University, and threw for 3,000 yards and 29 touchdowns. Lead running back Justice Ellison came from underwhelming Wake Forest, and rushed for more than 800 yards. Top receiver Elijah Sarratt followed his coach from James Madison and hauled in 53 catches for 957 yards. Linebacker Aiden Fisher also came from JMU. He led the defense with 118 tackles.\n \n\n   \n  He’s followed the same formula this year. Running back Kaelon Black, another James Madison transfer, leads the team with 439 yards on the ground and Sarratt is back atop the receivers, with nine TDs and 603 yards receiving.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is this year’s quarterback. A coveted player at the time of his transfer from Cal, Fernando Mendoza does not come to his Heisman-contending season via a gilded path. A former three-star recruit out of Miami and the grandson of Cuban immigrants, he initially signed with non-scholarship Yale before getting a late bite from Cal. He grew into his greatness.\n \n\n   \n  It’s all put Indiana into a rather unique pickle. Instead of searching for his next coach, Dolson had to make sure he could hang on to the one he had.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti’s success coupled with IU’s lack of tradition ordinarily would make the coach ripe for the picking from other bigger, more established programs. Dolson stopped the rumor mill before it started to churn, offering his coach a new  eight-year, $93 million deal  last week.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a nice salary jump for a man who was making $670,000 two years ago at James Madison.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti rewarded himself by buying some new furniture, though he kept a 36-year-old, well-worn Bradington Young recliner, despite protests from his wife, Manette. “It’s untouchable,’’ Cignetti told the Big Ten Network.\n \n\n   \n  Now, so is the coach.\n \n\n   \n    Energy, belief and hope\n \n\n   \n  The schedule breaks favorably going forward. Of Indiana’s remaining five opponents, UCLA is the only team with a winning record in the Big Ten. The rest are a combined 1-15 in the league, and a would-be reckoning at Penn State appears far less daunting now that the Nittany Lions  fired their coach  and lost their quarterback to injury.\n \n\n   \n  That would set up a potential Big Ten Championship Game showdown with the one contender the Hoosiers won’t face in the regular season:  Ohio State . The Hoosiers have won the conference title twice before, but it’s been almost 60 years since that glorious 1967 campaign.\n \n\n   \n  It is all quite heady and IU fans are basking in the joy. Clavio, for one, made the 10-hour roundtrip drive to Iowa and flew out for the game at Oregon. He’s already contemplating how to get to Maryland and Happy Valley.\n \n\n   \n  Patrons at Nick’s English Hut, the go-to spot for post-hoops victory revelry, broke out into song as the game clock hit zeroes against Oregon – a rousing rendition of the famous chorus from “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” –  and people are already imagining the giddy conundrum of important football games bleeding into basketball season.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also created yet another delightful first for the fall season in Bloomington: How to block out the noise.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been on this campus since my freshman year in 1984 and the feeling on campus with football, I’ve never seen anything like it,’’ Dolson said. “There’s energy. There’s belief. There’s hope. But, and I know it sounds cliché, but internally, we’re focused on the work.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not thinking about how far we’ve come and what we’ve done. Because when you focus on the work, you’re thinking about what you haven’t done yet.’’\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/alaska-airlines-it-outage","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-04:00","title":"Alaska Airlines Resumes Operations After IT Outage Canceled Hundreds of Flights","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alaska Airlines resumed operations after a major information technology outage that grounded hundreds of flights and affected its subsidiary Horizon Air.

investigating how a father hid his children from the world for almost four years in dense New Zealand wilderness have released new images of two makeshift camps where they believe the family spent most of their time.\n \n\n   \n  The photos of remote bush hideouts used by Tom Phillips, who was shot dead by police last month, show two large “established” camps which were “heavily concealed” by thick vegetation, north and east of Marokopa, on the country’s western coast.\n \n\n   \n  Detectives believe they served as the family’s main strongholds, enabling Phillips to navigate between the coast, farmland and wilderness with his three children ages 9 to 12.\n \n\n   \n  The secret bases helped the family live undetected until police finally tracked Phillips  down in the early hours of September 8 , and retrieved the children from deep within the forest.\n \n\n   \n  The images released Friday show a northern site with a wooden hut crafted from logs and topped with what appears to be a thatched straw roof, with its walls partially exposed to the elements.\n \n\n   \n  An image of the interior shows a damp, muddy floor, a plastic bucket, two partially filled jerry cans and a thick rope tethered to a stump atop a supporting wooden pole.\n \n\n   \n  An aerial shot of the eastern hideout captures it as a mere speck beneath an expansive tree canopy.\n \n\n   \n  Closer images reveal a more substantial structure with a pointed roof, made from logs and foliage, housing a log table and several bags, rope and a helmet hanging from the rafters which are covered by a plastic tarpaulin.\n \n\n   \n  An additional photo shows a low shelter, barely tall enough to sit upright, covered in foliage camouflaging the family’s location.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said stumbling upon these sites by chance would have been almost impossible and that approaching Phillips in such circumstances “would have been extremely dangerous.”\n \n\n   \n  “As we’ve said previously, we knew he had firearms and was motivated to use them,” Detective Superintendent Ross McKay said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have removed a haul of items from the camps for forensic examination as part of ongoing enquiries to identify anyone who might have assisted Phillips during his time on the run.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to make good progress and believe he was assisted by a small number of people at different stages over the last four years,” McKay added.\n \n\n   \n  Phillips, who came from a farming family in Marokopa, disappeared with his children into the rugged wilderness during a bitter family split in December 2021.\n \n\n   \n  At first, Phillips was wanted for failing to appear in court on charges of wasting police resources but, over the course of almost four years, his charge sheet grew longer and more serious, with allegations that he robbed a bank in May 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Police scrambled search teams, helicopters and planes to investigate sporadic sightings until police finally confronted him on a rural road and returned gunfire when he shot and injured an officer.\n \n\n   \n  The eldest child was with him when he was shot dead by

 \n  By Amanda Musa, Hanna Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:29 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is accused of throwing at least one tear gas canister into a crowd of protesters in a Chicago neighborhood Thursday in a potential violation of a judge’s order restricting federal agents from using aggressive crowd control tactics during anti-ICE protests.\n \n\n   \n  A new court filing against the Department of Homeland Security alleges Bovino “apparently threw tear gas into a crowd without justification” during a protest against federal immigration authorities in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  The notice of alleged violation was filed by a combination of media groups, individual protesters and Chicago-area clergy members who earlier this month  obtained a temporary restraining order  from US District Judge Sara Ellis after suing DHS and Trump officials over federal agents’ tactics against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The filing cites a Facebook video post that shows Bovino throw an object toward protesters Thursday morning. The video, which CNN has viewed, does not show clearly what happened in the minutes leading up to the alleged incident or if any warnings were given.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino appears to throw either one or two tear gas canisters over the heads of armed federal agents in front of him and in the direction of a crowd of individuals protesting, including an individual filming the encounter,” the filing from Thursday states.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’  sweeping order  restricts agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists and others at protests in Chicago, but it includes exceptions for individuals who pose a threat to law enforcement or others. During a hearing  last week , she said she had concerns about whether her order was being followed.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino is one of more than a dozen administration officials named as defendants in the lawsuit filed earlier this month, which accuses federal agents of “a pattern of extreme brutality” intended to “silence the press and civilians.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN has reached out to DHS for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Hours before the court filing alleging a possible violation of the judge’s order, Bovino defended federal agents’ conduct in the Chicago area during an  interview with CBS News .\n \n\n   \n  “The use of force I’ve seen has been exemplary. By exemplary, I would say the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,” Bovino said, in response to attacks he’s seen carried out on federal agents by “extremists and others.”\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Chicago have ramped up since federal agents were deployed on the city’s streets early September during what the Trump administration has titled “ Operation Midway Blitz, ” a targeted crackdown on illegal immigration that has led to over 1,000 arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agents’ response to the demonstrations has drawn widespread outcry, notably when  an area pastor  was  seen on video  being shot in the head with pepper balls by officers perched on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Bovino insisted such tactics do not necessarily violate DHS policy, telling CBS: “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them. Don’t protest, and don’t trespass.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis has ordered Bovino be deposed in the case and a preliminary injunction hearing is set for November 5. On Thursday, the court expanded Bovino’s deposition time to five hours.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, 55, has  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democrat-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, who formally heads Border Patrol’s El Centro sector in California, has been leading the federal crackdown in Chicago after helming similar operations in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  His heavy-handed tactics, including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled consternation among some in the Trump administration while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced the creation of the  Illinois Accountability Commission  “to pursue accountability for the people of Illinois,” amid the surge in federal immigration enforcement in his state.\n \n\n   \n  The commission is charged with creating a public record of federal enforcement abuses, capturing the impact of the enforcements on families and communities in Illinois, and recommending actions to “prevent further harm and to pursue justice,” Pritzker said.\n \n\n   \n  Criticism over federal authorities’ tactics in Chicago comes amid the broader legal battle over Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops in the city.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, US District Court Judge April Perry  ordered an extension  of the order blocking the deployment of Guard troops to Chicago through final judgment. The Trump administration is urging  the Supreme Court  to allow the deployment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/basketball-nba-terry-rozier-arrested-betting-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:55:00-04:55","title":"Feds reveal mafia-linked gambling probe that led to arrests of Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and NBA star Terry Rozier","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. federal government, through the Eastern District of New York, revealed a sweeping investigation into organized crime-linked gambling operations involving NBA athletes.

Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones  are among 34 people indicted in connection  with two separate federal gambling investigations announced by the Eastern District of New York on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  At a lengthy and at times spirited news conference that included FBI Director Kash Patel, US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr., and others detailed the sweeping multi-year investigations that spanned 11 states, resulted in the arrests of 34 people, involved tens of millions of dollars and included members of the notorious Bonanno, Genovese, Gambino and Luchese crime families.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, who coached in the Trail Blazers’ opening game on Wednesday night, was arrested in Portland on Thursday morning and is expected to appear in federal court there later on Thursday. Rozier, arrested in Orlando, will appear there.\n \n\n   \n  Both will be arraigned at a later date in Brooklyn.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, who retired in 2012, is one of three people to be charged in both cases.\n \n\n   \n  “My message to the defendants who have been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,’’ Nocella said. “Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that.’’\n \n\n   \n  Billups, the Portland head coach since 2021, is charged in an elaborate scheme in which marks were lured to participate in rigged poker games in part with the opportunity to play alongside the NBA five-time All-Star as well as Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, Nocella said, knowingly served as the so-called “face card,” to attract the “fish,” to underground games in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and the Hamptons that they had no chance of winning. Those involved in the scheme used rigged card-shuffling machines, poker chip trays and even special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. In some instances, the alleged conspirators used X-ray tables that reveal cards when they are placed face down.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said the scheme, deemed “Zen Diagram” by the feds, “fleeced” victims out of tens of millions of dollars. One alleged victim lost $1.8 million. The money was then laundered by the crime families.\n \n\n   \n  “And when people refused to pay, these defendants did what organized crime has always done,’’ New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “They used threats. They used intimidation. And they used violence. It’s the same pattern that we have seen for decades, traditional mob enforcement methods combined with new technology to expand the reach of their operations.’’\n \n\n   \n  Rozier, who was arrested in an Orlando hotel, was alleged to participate in a game-fixing scheme that included prop bets on his availability.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators allege between December 2022 and March 2024, Rozier tipped people about his availability for games, citing seven specific games in their investigation including one, against the New Orleans Pelicans, already flagged by sportsbooks for irregular activity.\n \n\n   \n  In that March 2023 game, Rozier, then with the Charlotte Hornets, left the game after just nine minutes with an injury. According to investigators, Rozier shared that inside information, and his co-conspirator bettors made $200,000 in wagers on the under.\n \n\n   \n  “Those bets paid out, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profit,’’ Tisch said. “The proceeds were later delivered to his home, where the group counted their cash.’’\n \n\n   \n  That investigation, deemed “Nothing But Net,” also included the previous arrest of former Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter, who was banned from the NBA in 2024 and later admitted to manipulating his performance in two games. He is awaiting sentencing.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said other defendants involved in the case threatened Porter, who had pre-existing gambling debts, in order to get the inside information.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the insider trading saga of the NBA,’’ FBI Director Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA has said previously it looked into the game involving Rozier against the Pelicans and that no rules had been broken. He was with the Heat, who opened their season on Wednesday, but did not play due to a coach’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying that prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.\n \n\n   \n  “But at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel,’’ Trusty said.\n \n\n   \n  “They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case. They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Trail Blazers and other teams mentioned in the news conference. Attorney information for Billups was not immediately available.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the NBA said, “We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today. Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.”\n \n\n   \n  The Heat directed press inquiries to the NBA statement. The Trail Blazers noted that Tiago Splitter will be taking on interim head coaching duties as Billups is on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the allegations involving head coach Chauncey Billups, and the Trail Blazers are fully cooperating with the investigation. Billups has been placed on immediate leave, and Tiago Splitter will assume head coaching duties in the interim. Any further questions should be directed to the NBA,” the Blazers said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell and Mark Morales contributed reporting to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/abbe-lowell-letitia-james-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Washington mega lawyer Abbe Lowell, 73, is the fresh face of the Trump resistance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abbe Lowell, a 73-year-old Washington attorney, has emerged as a leading figure in the legal resistance to the Trump administration, defending high-profile individuals such as John Bolton, Letitia James, Gary Condit, John Edwards, Hunter Biden, and others.

   \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorney Abbe Lowell stood beside  John Bolton  in a federal courthouse in Maryland last week as Donald Trump’s former national security adviser pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, Lowell was at a federal appeals court in Philadelphia arguing that President Trump’s  choice of US attorney for New Jersey  is unlawful. And on Friday, Lowell will be beside New York Attorney General  Letitia James  in Norfolk, Virginia, as she is arraigned on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James has called the charges “baseless.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowell has for decades been a moth to the flame of Washington politics and scandal. He built his reputation by getting politicians out of legal trouble or advocating pointedly before television cameras to try to sway public opinion and influence prosecutors’ decision making.\n \n\n   \n  Now, at 73, Lowell is one of the most prominent faces defending many of Trump’s perceived enemies in criminal investigations, security clearance revocations, and other matters.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a lawyers’ lawyer in that the politics aren’t what motivates the case,” said Mark Zaid, a high-profile Washington, DC, lawyer who represents whistleblowers. Zaid hired Lowell and other attorneys when the Trump administration revoked his security clearance.  They filed a lawsuit, which is pending, to try to get it restored.\n \n\n   \n  “He argues for the rule of law and this administration is subverting the rule of law so much that I wish there was an army of Abbe Lowells who, even if they didn’t have his skill, that they have his desire to uphold the integrity of the system and the principles that this country was founded on,” Zaid said.\n \n\n   \n  While Lowell is taking on Trump now, his past clients include Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner when they were questioned as part of the special counsel investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He also defended President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who went to trial and was convicted of gun-related charges. Biden also pleaded guilty to tax crimes. (He was later pardoned.)\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Lowell left Winston & Strawn, the large DC law firm where he spent the past seven years, to set up his own firm to represent clients in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. He’s bolstered his team with a cadre of young lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to James, Bolton and Zaid, Lowell is also representing others targeted by Trump, including Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor and several former FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors who were fired from their positions.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell declined to be interviewed. In a statement he said he started his own firm to fill a need.\n \n\n   \n  “The catalyst was the Trump administration’s attempts to use the legal system to silence perceived opponents and critics. I have challenged government overreach in every administration since President Reagan, but the scale and scope of Trump’s intrusion required action,” Lowell said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised on Long Island where his father was an insurance agent and his mother was a doctor’s assistant. He graduated from Columbia Law School and swiftly made his way to Washington and into politics.\n \n\n   \n  He served as counsel to House Democrats during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings. Soon thereafter Lowell represented California Democratic Rep. Gary Condit during the disappearance of intern Chandra Levy in 2001. Condit was  interviewed  by the police amid reports of a romantic relationship with her. He declined to speak to the media, while Lowell frequently sparred with journalists on TV. Condit was never charged with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Former Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. John Edwards hired Lowell when he went on trial on campaign finance charges. The trial dominated the headlines. Edwards was acquitted of one charge and the jury deadlocked on others.\n \n\n   \n  “In these politically charged cases you have to wear two hats. You have to be traditionally good in court … but then you also have to have some sophistication about the way Washington works. Abbe wears both,” said Reid Weingarten, a Washington criminal defense lawyer and long-time friend of Lowell’s. “I think the Edwards trial sent him on the path to become a defense attorney trial guy.”\n \n\n   \n  Weingarten encountered Lowell decades earlier when he was a prosecutor investigating a Tennessee lawmaker who Lowell represented.\n \n\n   \n  “Each thing he handled he took incredibly seriously like there was nothing more important than this particular matter, this client, this cross examination. It accounts for much of his success,” said Weingarten. “He devotes his all to it and Abbe’s all is way more than most.” (The lawmaker was not charged with any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez turned to Lowell when he faced bribery charges in 2017. Then, a Newark jury failed to reach a verdict and a federal judge later  acquitted  Menendez on some charges. (Menendez was convicted in 2024 on different bribery charges in New York. Lowell did not represent him at trial).\n \n\n   \n  Lowell also represented Matthew Grimes, a former assistant to Trump donor and loyalist Tom Barrack. Barrack, who is now US ambassador to Turkey, and Grimes were both acquitted of federal charges of acting as foreign agents.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, Lowell fumbled with his microphone as he spoke with the jury and read aloud text messages, translating emojis as “smiley face,” that Grimes sent to an overseas counterpart who was part of the alleged scheme.\n \n\n   \n  One person involved in the case, who did not want to be identified, said Lowell’s actions appeared to disarm his client to the jury and turned the allegedly criminal exchanges into seemingly benign chats between young men looking to impress each other.\n \n\n   \n  “He understands all the intangibles that go into presenting to a jury that’s different from the facts and the law. Those are the things that make him a very good lawyer,” said one lawyer who has opposed him.\n \n\n   \n  “Outside of the courtroom, generally, he’s a tough guy. He’s no holds-barred – a lot of posturing, a lot of self-righteousness. It worked for him,” the person said.\n \n\n   \n    Accused of posturing\n \n\n   \n  Lowell’s posturing and what some lawyers describe as brash manner aren’t without controversy.\n \n\n   \n  He took over Hunter Biden’s representation after a plea deal to end the criminal investigation blew up spectacularly during a court hearing, ending any potential for the case to be resolved before his father’s re-election campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell shifted the strategy to a more aggressive public posture, sparring with Republicans on the hill and teeing the case for trial.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, lurid details of Hunter Biden’s drug use and sex life spilled into the public in the middle of Biden’s re-election campaign.\n \n\n   \n  During  opening arguments , Lowell leaned into Biden’s drug use as something millions of Americans deal with. At one point while Lowell was speaking, one juror appeared to become emotional, reaching for tissues in her bag and dabbed her eyes and her nose several times.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell used the same direct manner in representing James, writing pointed letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Ed Martin, who was named special attorney for mortgage fraud at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Martin criticized Lowell’s tactics, writing in a private letter, “Because of your reputation for using the media to argue your points, I prefer that we communicate by letter. I find leaks like your Bondi letter professionally unacceptable and personally insulting. To that end, I specifically ask that you redouble your efforts to not leak this confidential letter.”\n \n\n   \n  Six days later, Lowell replied.\n \n\n   \n  “You cannot unilaterally conduct a media campaign to prejudice and intimidate my client and expect there will be no similar public response,” Lowell wrote. “And, whenever you do bring your threatened action, please explain to the judges before whom you file all that you have been saying and doing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/chicago-ice-raids-resistance-efforts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Residents of Chicago Suburbs Resist ICE Raids Amid Nationwide Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, residents of Mount Prospect, Illinois, confronted masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during a federal enforcement operation under 'Operation Midway Blitz,' which had led to over 1,000 arrests in Illinois since September.

      \n  By Danya Gainor, Sara Smart, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the quiet village of Mount Prospect, nestled just northwest of Chicago’s city limits, residents were sheltering from the cold and rain on a sleepy Sunday afternoon watching TV, scrolling through social media and enjoying midday coffee at home.\n \n\n   \n  As rain pattered against windows, and trees lining the streets swayed, flurries of urgent texts began ricocheting from one end of the neighborhood to the other, and panic set in as some residents put on their shoes and hurried out the door.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE IS HERE,” one text between Mount Prospect neighbors said.\n \n\n   \n  “F**king helicopters. Ice at Owen Park,” read another. “On our way,” one neighbor replied.\n \n\n   \n  The historic suburb quickly devolved into a scene that has  become familiar  to places like nearby  Chicago  and elsewhere across the country as President Donald Trump works to execute his Day 1 promise to crack down on  immigration and crime : A Homeland Security helicopter whirred overhead, several SUVs and trucks with tinted windows drove slowly past houses, and around two dozen masked federal agents meandered through yards and walked down sidewalks, according to images and interviews with residents.\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors stepped out of their homes to document the agents who had descended on their community, joining a coalition of opposition to the president’s unwavering determination to  detain and deport undocumented migrants  en masse  – a  resistance effort  spreading throughout US cities that have seen their workers, schoolchildren and community members swept up in ICE raids.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Response network confirmed high levels of immigration enforcement activity in Rolling Meadows, Wheeling, Prospect Heights & Mt. Prospect,” read a text from an ICE activity alert system run by a local immigrant rights group, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “At least 4 people have been detained.”\n \n\n   \n  Without knowing exactly where she was headed, Mount Prospect resident and small business owner Dawn Ardito grabbed her phone and driver’s license and rushed out the door after receiving some of the texts. She had reached only the end of her block before spotting the first set of SUVs with dark windows driven by men in masks and fatigues.\n \n\n   \n  She followed the cars to a nearby street with even more SUVs and agents. Ardito joined the handful of neighbors who had gathered, recording the federal officers with her phone, asking them what they were doing and demanding they leave.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t belong here,” Ardito said she told immigration enforcement agents. “Our neighbors, they do belong here. Our community members, they do belong here.”\n \n\n   \n  Agents told residents they were looking for an “escaped criminal,” describing the person to Ardito and others as a “gang member” at one point, then a “murder suspect” and “sex offender” as the operation went on.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Mount Prospect police said they encountered the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers while responding to a 911 call about a person running through a nearby backyard. Officers left after they “confirmed these were federal agents,” and didn’t participate in the operation, “as this would be in violation of Illinois State Law and the Trust Act,” Officer Greg Sill said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Another person living in Mount Prospect who was mobilized by the texts, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said she hoped to chase out the agents with her screams like she’d seen in videos on social media of similar encounters around Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “People should be coming out of their houses and confronting (agents),” the resident said. “I have neighbors who are terrified to leave their houses. … Nobody should have to live like that, not in any neighborhood.”\n \n\n   \n  For more than an hour, residents screamed, videotaped and tailed federal vehicles, raucously honking horns to send the message: Their operation is not welcome here.\n \n\n   \n  Agents left the area after about two hours, neighbors said. It’s not clear whether agents arrested the person they told residents they were searching for.\n \n\n   \n  “If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere,” Ardito said. “Just because you haven’t seen it outside your front door like I saw it this weekend -– only time will tell until we all see that.”\n \n\n   \n    Packing whistle kits and buying out street vendors: How Chicagoans are opposing ICE in their neighborhoods\n \n\n   \n  At “ No Kings ” protests, Latino independence  celebrations  or ordinary afternoons in the streets of Chicago, bright orange whistles swing from community members’ necks, ready to cut through the city’s bustle should federal immigration agents appear.\n \n\n   \n  The whistles have become a peaceful display of opposition as  federal agents have been deployed  across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  In Belmont Cragin, a northwest Chicago community, local organizers have rallied hundreds of volunteers to create kits packed with the whistles, handouts showing when to use them and bilingual flyers detailing what bystanders’ and detainees’ rights are when agents are conducting arrests.\n \n\n   \n  One pamphlet in the kit reads, “Form a crowd, stay loud,” instructing users to blow the whistles as they spot ICE activity to guide nearby Chicagoans to where the agents are patrolling or conducting arrests so they can make noise, document or follow agents’ caravans.\n \n\n   \n  Alonso Zaragoza, an organizer helping to run Belmont Cragin United, said the group has 30,000 whistle kits to distribute throughout the city. The group is hosting its next “Whistlemania” event October 29, when nearly 80 Chicago communities are expected to come together to fold pamphlets and pack plastic whistles to reach their goal of 100,000 kits.\n \n\n   \n  “Immigrants keep us moving forward. They’re the oil in the machine that is our community,” Zaragoza said. “Hopefully Whistlemania takes off in other communities, like in  Portland , to protect their immigrant populations.”\n \n\n   \n  But many immigrants in Chicago now fear venturing out into the very community they help sustain.\n \n\n   \n  West 26th Street, in the predominantly Latino community of Little Village, once boasted an array of friendly street vendors selling shaved ice and fresh corn, with their carts dotting the busy road. Since “Operation Midway Blitz” launched, locals say street corners are emptier, and vendors who set up shop do so at their own risk.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody who is getting arrested right now are people who are going to work,” said Erendira Rendon, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based nonprofit. “Folks have to stay inside to stay safe.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago resident Rick Rosales, a community organizer and co-founder of Cycling x Solidarity, a local cycling group dedicated to mutual aid, started raising money when raids began to ramp up to buy up all the vendors’ food to get them off the street for the day.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday morning, Rosales and a few other volunteers biked up to a woman selling empanadas in the pouring rain. On the street next to her tent, the woman’s young child was sitting in her parked car as she worked. The bikers bought every empanada she had.\n \n\n   \n  “She was incredibly grateful, very taken by surprise,” Rosales said. “And no sooner did we pack up the bikes with all her goods, she’s already packed up her cooler and tent. It’s cold, it’s raining, it’s early in the morning – she has a child, and now they get to go home.”\n \n\n   \n  After buying out a vendor, the bikers pass out the food to encampments and shelters.\n \n\n   \n  Rosales’ group works with the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, which typically helps vendors design menus and obtain permits, to fundraise and identify sellers. Together, the groups organize bike tours where riders buy from a series of vendors as they explore the city.\n \n\n   \n  “A few of our vendors have been detained (by ICE),” said Maria Orozco, outreach coordinator of the association. “So, we try to protect our vendors and make sure they’re good and make sure that the community supports them.”\n \n\n   \n    Chicago is the epicenter of immigration crackdowns amid ongoing legal battles\n \n\n   \n  As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with residents, Chicago is being cemented as the  epicenter  of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of legal developments.\n \n\n   \n  The Windy City was thrust into the national spotlight after a federal appeals court temporarily  allowed the federalization  of Illinois National Guard troops but blocked their deployment within the state.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday  urged the Supreme Court  to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, putting the explosive legal fight over his ability to use those troops on American soil before the justices for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  That framing stands in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order  earlier this month .\n \n\n   \n  Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois and the city of Chicago have  asked the justices  to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state and have fiercely denied the administration’s descriptions of crime in the Prairie State’s biggest city.\n \n\n   \n  For residents in Chicago communities like Little Village and Belmont Cragin, and outside city limits in Mount Prospect and across Illinois, the work goes on.\n \n\n   \n  “I now have this whole new network of people that we have connected with, and having this firsthand experience, it has really bonded us,” Ardito said. “We are now making sure we’re connected and looking for what we can do to continue to protect our community and to continue to push back.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Omar Jimenez contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/trump-retribution-public-opinion-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Americans seem to see through Trump’s legal retribution","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes public opinion in the United States regarding President Donald Trump’s legal retribution campaign against political opponents.

12:01 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald Trump’s norm-busting  legal retribution campaign  against his perceived political foes continues, Americans seem to be seeing it for what it is.\n \n\n   \n  Motions are  being filed  in former FBI Director James Comey’s case. On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James is due to be arraigned in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  And  CNN reported  Thursday that Ed Martin, one of the most polarizing Trump Justice Department officials, has been pushing for the investigation into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff’s alleged mortgage fraud to lead to an indictment, despite prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office being hesitant to proceed with charges.\n \n\n   \n  Trump declined to weigh in on a possible Schiff indictment on Thursday, saying, “I hope it’s true, but I don’t know anything.”\n \n\n   \n  As the administration has targeted the president’s enemies, the big question has been whether Americans would see it as just some political tit-for-tat equivalent to the indictments of Trump, or whether they’d recognize it as an extraordinary weaponization of the justice system.\n \n\n   \n  The early verdict is in.\n \n\n   \n  Americans seem to see charges the Trump administration has brought against its enemies as significantly less serious and significantly more politicized than the indictments of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  A  Quinnipiac University poll  this week showed voters agreed 52%-38% that Trump was “using the U.S. Justice Department to file unjustified criminal charges against his political opponents.”\n \n\n   \n  Independents agreed with that sentiment by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 58%-31%.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll , meanwhile, showed Americans said 55%-26% that Trump was using federal law enforcement to go after his enemies. Even 29% of Republicans agreed with this.\n \n\n   \n  (The question, unlike the Quinnipiac poll, didn’t ask people to judge the legitimacy of the charges.)\n \n\n   \n  The polls would seem to be in line with a late September  survey from the Pew Research Center .\n \n\n   \n  That poll was conducted shortly after Trump removed a US attorney who resisted bringing charges against James and issued a public call for Attorney General Pam Bondi to bring them against Comey and James. Comey’s indictment landed soon after, which fell in the middle of the poll’s survey period.\n \n\n   \n  Pew showed 62% of Americans agreed Trump was at least “probably” improperly encouraging federal investigations of his political opponents. Even 40% of Republican-leaning Americans said Trump was probably doing this.\n \n\n   \n  These are pretty striking numbers that suggest a potential political problem for Trump, even as he moves forward.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most notably, the numbers suggest Americans see the situation as quite different from Trump’s indictments.\n \n\n   \n  The president baselessly accused then-President Joe Biden and a “weaponized” Justice Department of being behind the charges against him. (In fact, there is  much more to tie Trump to orchestrating the Comey and James indictments .)\n \n\n   \n  Analysts have generally regarded the recent classified documents charges against a third Trump foe, former national security adviser John Bolton,  as being more substantial . The case originated in the Biden administration, and Trump didn’t publicly push it like he did the James and Comey cases – or fire a prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  But Americans seem to see the charges against Trump as simply more serious than the overall charges his administration has brought against his enemies.\n \n\n   \n  While just 38% of voters in the Quinnipiac poll said the charges against Trump’s opponents were justified, Americans generally said by clear, double-digit margins that the cases against Trump were legitimate – and even that he was guilty. (Trump pleaded not guilty in all cases against him.)\n \n\n   \n  Americans said 56%-41% that the investigations against Trump were “fair” rather than a “witch hunt,” according to a  March 2023 Marist College poll  conducted shortly before his  first indictment.\n \n\n   \n  And they said  47%-31% that the charges owed to Trump’s own actions , rather than an “abuse of the justice system,” according to an August 2023 CNN poll.\n \n\n   \n  Americans said  57%-41%  that the Justice Department was holding Trump accountable like anyone else, rather than that DOJ was “unfairly targeting Trump for political reasons,” according to a December 2023 Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.\n \n\n   \n  And they said 58%-37% that there was “credible evidence” that Trump committed serious federal crimes, according to an August 2023  Public Religion Research Institute poll .\n \n\n   \n  Near-majorities of Americans  saw political motivations  in many of the cases. And even more saw that in the Manhattan hush money case in which Trump was eventually convicted.\n \n\n   \n  But that didn’t mean Americans saw those cases as illegitimate “witch hunts” or “hoaxes,” as Trump claims they were.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Americans seem much more inclined to believe that about the cases Trump is orchestrating against his foes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-sophia-forchas-released","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:59:00-05:00","title":"57 Days After a Gunshot to the Head, 12-Year-Old School Massacre Survivor Has Returned Home","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sophia Forchas, a 12-year-old student at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, survived a deadly shooting on August 27, 2025, during a prayer session when the shooter fired through stained glass windows, killing two children and injuring 20 others.

detention centers, Trump administration turns to the US Navy \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security is funneling $10 billion through the Navy to help facilitate the construction of a sprawling network of migrant   detention centers across the US in an arrangement aimed at getting the centers built faster, according to sources and federal contracting documents.\n \n\n   \n  Construction on some of the facilities is set to begin as soon as next month, one of the sources familiar with the project told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest example of the Trump administration  leveraging the US military  to support its immigration enforcement efforts, stemming from the White House’s desire to dramatically  ramp up nationwide immigration operations  and arrest a record number of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  The contracting program, which has not been previously reported, is a joint effort between DHS and the Defense Department and leans on the Navy’s Supply Systems Command as a contracting arm to hire companies for construction and maintenance of the detention facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The new detention centers are likely to be primarily soft-sided tents and may or may not be built on existing Navy installations, according to the sources familiar with the initiative. DHS has often leaned on soft-sided facilities to manage influxes of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources said the goal is for the facilities to house as many as 10,000 people each, and are expected to be built in Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Utah and Kansas. Additional details about the facilities remain unclear, as the contracting process is still ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  An uptick in immigration arrests has required more detention space to hold people for processing and potentially deportation. ICE, which also uses local jails to hold people, was previously funded for around 41,000 beds to temporarily house detainees. White House border czar Tom Homan has said he wants to double that number of detention beds—and fast.\n \n\n   \n  For that reason, Homeland Security officials have been trying to find ways to quickly secure contracts, which can often be delayed by federal competition rules. DHS has been “bouncing around from one contract vehicle to another,” one source said, as challenges and delays in contracts have previously created headaches for the department.\n \n\n   \n  In July, ICE secured $45 billion worth of additional funding from Congress to build new detention facilities. One such facility was built at Fort Bliss Army base in Texas and  reportedly violated  dozens of federal detention standards.\n \n\n   \n  The latest contract approach, through the Defense Department, is expected to narrow the pool of eligible contractors and accelerate the contracting process, sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy solicitation listed on a federal contracting site provides a preview of what will be expected of contractors. For example, they will be expected to build a range of structures within the detention facilities themselves, including courtrooms and administrative and support space for ICE staff, according to the documents reviewed by CNN. And they will be required to ensure ready access to emergency services and airport transfers, the documents say, highlighting ICE’s varied needs as it works to carry out Trump’s mass deportation agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy and DHS did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not surprising they would do this, especially for this type of quick turnaround construction,” said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on defense spending. “The military is good at logistics, and they’ve had to do quick turn construction projects like this overseas. You’re already dealing with an organization that knows how to do this type of contracting activity, and do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  To facilitate the construction, the Navy quietly broadened an existing contracting mechanism in July to “add a new geographic region”— the United States and outlying territories.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, the contract solicitation, known as the Worldwide Expeditionary Multiple Award Contract, had been used primarily to support military operations abroad. But in July, it was amended as “WEXMAC 2.1, Territorial Integrity of the United States,” and now notes that contractors “may be required to provide infrastructure, staffing, services, and/or supplies necessary to provide safe and secure confinement for aliens in the administrative custody” of DHS and ICE.\n \n\n   \n  It also stipulates that new contracts will involve Defense Support of Civil Authorities — a process by which US military assets and personnel can be used to support domestic law enforcement missions — and says that contractors “will provide for the secure custody, care, and safekeeping of aliens in accordance with state and local laws, standards, policies, procedures for firearms requirements, or court orders applicable.”\n \n\n   \n  The new solicitation also says that contractors building and staffing the facilities do not have “right of refusal, and shall take all referrals from ICE as applicable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/china/china-fourth-plenum-five-year-plan-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:01:00Z","title":"In its rivalry with the US, China sees an advantage: the long game","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China is finalizing its next five-year economic plan, emphasizing technological self-reliance, manufacturing advancement, and national security amid deepening rivalry with the United States.

AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Chinese leaders have just concluded a  closed-door conclave  focused on drawing up the country’s next five-year economic blueprint – a sweeping plan covering everything from accelerating tech innovation to streamlining how China’s farms grow food.\n \n\n   \n  Stakes are high for formulating that strategy, with Chinese officials under pressure to reduce reliance on imported technology and address economic weaknesses as the country faces a deepening rivalry with the US.\n \n\n   \n  But drawing up the plan – especially at a moment when Washington remains  immobilized by a government shutdown  over spending for the current fiscal year – also gives leader Xi Jinping an opportunity to showcase a source of his confidence in China’s rise: the authoritarian country’s ability to produce – and deliver on – far-reaching visions.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese state media and officials have not been delicate about playing up what they see as that competitive advantage in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “Scientifically formulating and continuously implementing the five-year plan is … a key political advantage of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Many foreign political parties envy us for this,” Jiang Jinquan, an official with the Communist Party Central Committee’s Policy Research Office, said at a press briefing Friday, adding that such plans were essential for “gaining strategic initiative in the midst of intense international competition.”\n \n\n   \n  A  commentary  in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily published Thursday praised how China “views the whole country as one chessboard… and continues to advance steadily along the correct direction,” while “some countries remain trapped in the shortsightedness and constant policy reversals under multiparty systems.”\n \n\n   \n  “Long-termism,” a blend of continuity and flexibility, is something “Western countries find difficult to match,” another  article , in state media agency Xinhua, quoted Tsinghua University professor Yan Yilong as saying.\n \n\n   \n  A separate  commentary  published by Beijing Daily, meanwhile, spotlighted the “out of control” situation in the US, pointing to the “No Kings” protests, the government shutdown, and a controversial  AI-generated video meme  shared by US President Donald Trump last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  It concluded: “The (American) halo is illusory, and the myth is fragile. To use Trump’s own words: The United States has become a failed state in many ways and is ‘dying from within.’”\n \n\n   \n  Such rhetoric is, of course, not unusual within China’s tightly controlled propaganda environment. And officials have long looked to play up the ills of other countries, especially the US, to boost their own image for domestic and, increasingly, international audiences.\n \n\n   \n  But the sentiment also reflects the thinking of the country’s ruling Communist Party – and its leader Xi – at a moment when the two countries are sparring over tech and trade as they grapple with how to structure their economic relationship and rivalry.\n \n\n   \n  And the chance to amplify that sentiment, through the pomp of crafting the upcoming five-year plan, couldn’t come at a better moment for Xi, days ahead of a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea, and weeks after China reignited US ire by expanding its  rare earths export control regime. \n \n\n   \n    The five-year plan\n \n\n   \n  Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not be released until after its approval by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March. But an overview of the priorities approved by a powerful Communist Party committee that met over four days this week exuded confidence in China’s continued rise.\n \n\n   \n  “We will strive for another five years to achieve a significant leap forward in our country’s economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength, comprehensive national power, and international influence by 2035,” a communique released by state media Thursday said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials would “accelerate the development of building China’s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaders signaled they would stay the course on “accelerating high-level scientific and technological self-reliance” and infusing high tech into industry – building on China’s current efforts to upgrade its manufacturing and capacity to innovate.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposals advocate for a forward-looking layout for future industries, promoting quantum technology, biotechnology, hydrogen energy, nuclear fusion, brain-computer interfaces, embodied intelligence, and sixth-generation mobile communications as new drivers of economic growth,” Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The signaling following the meeting in Beijing suggested China would double down on its position as a manufacturing and industrial powerhouse, despite longstanding views from some analysts that it should transition to a services-driven economy as many developed economies have. The communique also stressed the importance of national security and the need to “accelerate the building of advanced combat capabilities” for the military.\n \n\n   \n  Officials pointed to efforts to address challenges like flagging domestic consumption, socioeconomic inequality and “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. China would “vigorously boost consumption” and “improve the social security system,” as well as further opening China’s market to international players, according to the communique.\n \n\n   \n  How officials precisely plan to achieve these goals will only become clearer over the coming months and years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A vital political advantage’\n \n\n   \n  Observers have long noted the ability of China’s tightly controlled system to achieve far-reaching goals.\n \n\n   \n  The country has raised hundreds of millions out of poverty, transformed into the world’s second-largest economy and a global growth engine, and more recently emerged as a technological powerhouse and a proponent of the green transition across the world.\n \n\n   \n  And as the US shakes up its own foreign and domestic policy under Trump, Beijing is also touting China’s planning as proof that it, not the US, is a responsible global leader.\n \n\n   \n  “In today’s global environment, some major powers frequently change their policies, and such ‘unpredictability’ has cast a shadow over world peace and development,” an editorial in state-backed tabloid Global Times published Friday said.\n \n\n   \n  “The development roadmap unveiled in the communique for China’s next five years offers the world something truly rare in these turbulent times – certainty,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike in Western democracies, where visions for a country are articulated by leaders elected by popular vote – and can often be voted down by opposition lawmakers – China’s five-year plans are crafted in the upper echelons of the Communist Party, ostensibly with what Beijing calls “mass consultation” with various sectors of society. Xi sits “at the helm” of this process, according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  Once set, five-year plans act as marching orders for officials across the sprawling apparatus of the government and a guide for businesses, universities and other organizations on how to align their own strategies with the party’s.\n \n\n   \n  Such plans have at times had disastrous consequences. The “Great Leap Forward” associated with the second five-year plan of 1958, that was supposed to drive China’s industrialization, instead drove the country into famine, killing an estimated tens of millions of people.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, plans have spurred China’s energetic efforts to build out new industries like green technology and electric vehicles and upgrade factory production, but also shown some of the drawbacks of state-backed planning.\n \n\n   \n  Take EVs, for example. China now dominates the sector globally, yet state support has also created artificial market saturation, driving price wars and an ongoing wave of company failures.\n \n\n   \n  But for Xi, who is determined not to see China’s rise hindered by Western export controls and trade barriers, it’s clear that the power to chart out a vision, to deliver with a deadline in 2030, underlines his faith that his system will ultimately win out.\n \n\n   \n  Or in his own words, as recently quoted in state media, when it comes to China’s “revitalization,” this planning creates “a vital political advantage.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/virginia-democrats-house-redistricting-battle","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:37:00-04:00","title":"Virginia Democrats Prepare to Reshape US House Districts in Counter to Trump’s Redistricting Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Democrats are preparing to redraw their congressional districts in a direct response to President Donald Trump’s push for more partisan redistricting in Republican-controlled states.

prepare to reshape US House districts in counter to Trump’s redistricting push \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:37 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Virginia Democrats are taking steps to redraw their state’s US House districts, hoping to boost the party’s chances in next year’s midterm elections and counter President Donald Trump’s push for more partisan districts in Republican-run states.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia House Speaker Don Scott sent a letter Thursday to members telling them to convene Monday for a special session but did not state a reason. The purpose includes congressional redistricting aimed at gaining more Democratic-held seats, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because they are not authorized to publicly discuss them.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia would be the second state with a Democratic-led legislature after  California  to enter a national redistricting battle with enormous stakes. If Democrats gain just three more seats, they would take control of the House and effectively impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers in  Texas ,  Missouri  and  North Carolina  already have approved new congressional maps aimed at helping their party win more seats and retain the slim GOP House majority. And even more states are considering redistricting as the battle front widens.\n \n\n   \n  A spokeswoman for Democrats’ House campaign arm characterized the Virginia effort as the party pursuing “every available tool to counter Republicans’ desperate attempts to steal the midterms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia’s decision to convene and preserve the right to consider a new map in 2026 is critical in the fight to ensure voters have fair representation,” said Courtney Rice, communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans vowed to fight. Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore said Democrats missed their opportunity to carry out this procedure by 2026 and that it’s “too late constitutionally” to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “We are going to do everything legally we can do to stop this power grab,” Kilgore said.\n \n\n   \n  Voting districts typically are redrawn at the start of each decade to account for population changes noted by the census. But Trump took the unusual step over the summer of urging Republican-led states to reshape key districts to try to buck a historical trend of a president’s party losing seats in midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia currently is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans who ran in districts with boundaries imposed by a court after a bipartisan redistricting commission failed to agree on a map after the 2020 census.\n \n\n   \n  The effort to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts comes in the final weeks before the November 4 state legislative and statewide elections. But Monday’s session is just the start of what could be a long legislative process, running past the election.\n \n\n   \n  Because Virginia’s redistricting commission was established by a voter-approved constitutional amendment, the electorate must sign off on any changes. And any proposed change to the constitution must first pass the legislature in two separate sessions. Democrats are scrambling to hold that first vote this year, so that they can approve the change a second time after a new legislative session begins January 14.\n \n\n   \n  Voters still would have to approve a change in the constitution to allow using the new House map. And that vote would need to occur before congressional primaries, which are currently set for June 16 — though dates for such elections have been pushed back in the past.\n \n\n   \n  In many states, congressional districts are drawn by state lawmakers, subject to the approval of the governor. But North Carolina’s new map, which received final approval Wednesday from the Republican-led Legislature, did not have to go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. Those changes target a swing district held by Democratic US Rep. Don Davis by adding areas that contain more Republican-leaning voters.\n \n\n   \n  Like Virginia,  California  has a constitutionally established redistricting commission, which approved maps after the 2020 census. California voters are to decide in a November 4 election whether to temporarily suspend those districts and instead use a map approved by the Democratic-led Legislature that could help Democrats pick up as many as five additional seats.\n \n\n   \n  No voter approval is necessary for the revised districts in Missouri, North Carolina or Texas, though opponents in Missouri are gathering petition signatures to try to force a statewide vote on their new map.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-lindsey-halligan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:01:00.000-04:00","title":"NY AG Letitia James to ask for her case to be dismissed due to appointment of Lindsey Halligan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a motion to dismiss her indictment, alleging that the appointment of Lindsey Halligan—President Donald Trump’s handpicked U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia—violates due process and professional ethics.

They noted that the conversation, which was initiated by Halligan and occurred over the messaging platform Signal, included the prosecutor’s thoughts on the “credibility and general strength of the evidence presented to the grand jury.”\n \n\n   \n  “These extrajudicial statements and prejudicial disclosures by any prosecutor, let alone one purporting to be the U.S. Attorney, run afoul of and violate the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Code of Federal Regulations, this Court’s Local Rules, various rules of ethical and professional responsibility, and DOJ’s Justice Manual,” James’ attorneys wrote in court papers.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to ensure a fair trial and impartial proceedings for Attorney General James, we respectfully seek the Court’s intervention to prevent any further disclosures by government attorneys and agents of investigative and case materials, and statements to the media and public, concerning this case and any parties or witnesses,” the lawyers told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  They’re asking for a court order that would, among other things, bar Halligan and other prosecutors in the case from making “extrajudicial disclosures of investigative and case materials, and statements to the media and journalists.”\n \n\n   \n  Under their proposed order, prosecutors would also need to keep a list of all contacts they have with members of the media.\n \n\n   \n  “As the prosecutor who is ‘handling the case’ against Attorney General James and purporting to be the U.S. Attorney, Ms. Halligan is supposed to be the standard-bearer of the professional responsibility rules rather than the District’s violator-in-chief,” the attorney general’s lawyers wrote in their filing.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-drug-traffickers-congress-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:07:00-04:00","title":"Trump insists he can strike alleged drug traffickers without Congress declaring war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump asserts that he can launch military strikes against alleged drug traffickers in countries like Venezuela without a formal declaration of war from Congress, claiming such actions are necessary to combat drug trafficking.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:07 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday insisted that he could continue to launch  strikes against alleged drug traffickers  abroad without Congress first passing an official declaration of war.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he said. “I think we’re just doing to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We’re going to kill them, you know, they’re going to be like, dead.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s dismissal came as he suggested his administration would  soon begin targeting  those deemed as cartel members within countries like Venezuela, in addition to continuing to strike alleged drug boats in international waters.\n \n\n   \n  The president said he would notify Congress first before beginning any operations on “land,” but contended that the plan would not face any pushback from lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “We going to go. I don’t see any loss in going” to Congress, Trump said. “We’re going to tell them what we’re going to do and I think they’ll probably like it, except for the radical left lunatics.”\n \n\n   \n  The lethal strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and east Pacific have unnerved some lawmakers, given the little evidence the administration has presented proving that the targets were so-called narco-terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insisted that the military has confirmed that each targeted boat is trafficking drugs. Still, he defended the decision to  return two survivors  of a recent strike as “standard” practice in war.\n \n\n   \n  “Compared to Iraq and Afghanistan, the vast majority of people that we captured on the battlefield we handed over to the home country,” he said, referencing the US’ wars in the Middle East. “So in this case, those two, they were treated by American medics and handed immediately over to their countries where they came from.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s remarks come as an American B-1 Lancer bomber flew near the coast of Venezuela on Thursday, although the president denied that the US sent the B-1 bomber.\n \n\n   \n  “No, it’s not accurate. No. It’s false. But we’re not happy with Venezuela for a lot of reasons. Drugs being one of them, but also they’ve been sending their prisoners into our country for years under the Biden administration, not anymore, we have a closed border,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The aircraft first appeared on flight-tracking dashboards southwest of the Dallas Fort Worth area around 4:30 a.m. ET on Thursday and at its closest point was a little more than 50 miles from the Venezuelan mainland.\n \n\n   \n  About nine hours later, open-source flight data showed the bomber reappearing for around 15 minutes within Venezuela’s flight information region (FIR) – an area where air traffic control is provided by Venezuelan authorities.\n \n\n   \n  However, it was not immediately clear whether the plane — which was accompanied by a second aircraft during its appearance in the FIR — entered Venezuelan airspace.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Defense Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The flight comes as tensions continue to rise between the two countries following the deployment of US warships to the Caribbean on what Washington has said is part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign but Caracus fears is a cover for regime change.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday claimed his country had  5,000 Russian-made Igla-S anti-aircraft missiles  in “key air defense positions.”\n \n\n   \n  The missiles are short-range, low-altitude systems that can shoot down small aerial targets such as cruise missiles, drones and low-flying planes. While B-1s can fly at altitudes as high as 60,000 feet they can also operate as low as 200 feet above the ground.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/cuomo-mamdani-islam-nyc-mayoral-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:03:00.000-04:00","title":"Cuomo invokes fears of Mamdani’s Muslim faith in final days of NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final days of the 2025 New York City mayoral race, former Governor Andrew Cuomo intensified his campaign against Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner and first Muslim candidate for mayor, by repeatedly invoking concerns about Mamdani’s Muslim faith.

Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?” Cuomo posited.\n \n\n   \n  “He’d be cheering,” Rosenberg responded.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo paused and laughed along, adding, “That’s another problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The comments, made just days before New Yorkers cast their ballots, was the latest invocation by Cuomo of Mamdani’s Muslim faith and background.\n \n\n   \n  In the last days before the November 4 general election, Cuomo has repeatedly focused on Mamdani’s religion, arguing he was betraying Islam by supporting the decriminalization of sex work while also suggesting that Mamdani would betray New York City on matters of public safety and terrorism as he appeals to moderates and conservatives as well as Jewish voters concerned about  Mamdani’s criticism of Israel .\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believed Cuomo was making Islamophobic statements against him, Mamdani replied with “yes.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it’s also disgusting,” Mamdani told reporters Thursday. “Andrew Cuomo’s message is to smear and slander the first Muslim candidate on the verge of leading this city where 1 in 8 New Yorkers are Muslim and say that by virtue of your faith you are worthy of suspicion.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the Democrats who ripped Cuomo’s comments was US Rep. Ritchie Torres, who has  been a sharp critic  of Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “It should be possible to critique a candidate’s ideas without demonizing the candidate himself,” Torres  wrote  on X. “To insinuate that a mayoral candidate would celebrate a second 9/11 is beyond disgusting and disgraceful. We all have a responsibility to lower the temperature and to restore a measure of civility to our public discourse.”\n \n\n   \n  In one mayoral debate, Cuomo tore into Mamdani, who is a Shia Muslim, by referencing Sunni Muslims and saying Mamdani had ideas that were “haram,” or forbidden. The Shia-Sunni split dates nearly to the founding of Islam and has often animated religious and political tensions among Muslims.\n \n\n   \n  “To Zohran, I believe you have been a divisive force in New York, and I believe that’s toxic energy for New York,” Cuomo said. “It’s with the Sunni Muslims when you say decriminalize prostitution, which is haram.”\n \n\n   \n  Standing next to Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday hours after his radio interview, Cuomo nodded as Adams appeared to suggest Mamdani’s election would usher in Islamic extremism to New York.\n \n\n   \n  “New York can’t be Europe, folks,” Adams said “You see what’s playing out in other countries because of Islamic extremism, not Muslims. Let’s not mix this up.”\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday night’s debate, the Cuomo campaign posted and then quickly deleted an AI-generated video to social media, showing a fake version of Mamdani using his hands to shove rice into his mouth as a voiceover warned about Mamdani’s “radical” ideas.\n \n\n   \n  “The video was a proposal that wasn’t approved, wasn’t finished and didn’t go through the normal legal process,” Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said. “It was posted for five minutes before it was taken down.”\n \n\n   \n  And during the Democratic primary campaign, an anti-Mamdani super PAC that raised millions for Cuomo ran television ads that described Mamdani as “dangerous” by exclusively using footage of him wearing traditional South Asian clothing. Mamdani usually wears a suit when campaigning. Mamdani also accused Cuomo of sending mailers to voters which showed him with a darkened beard.\n \n\n   \n  Zara Rahim, a senior adviser on Mamdani’s campaign, said Cuomo was “trying to define what being Muslim should look like.”\n \n\n   \n  “He has only tried to court Muslim people by saying look at this bad Muslim – that is a desperate tactic from a man who has nothing to say to Muslim people,” Rahim said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo was questioned earlier this year for never having visited a mosque during his nearly 12 years as governor of New York, a state home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the country. Now, his campaign says he’s been to several, sometimes making multiple stops in a single week.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s newfound effort to court the South Asian community was also the topic of intense sparring between Cuomo and Mamdani in the first debate, with Cuomo at one point suggesting Mamdani’s politics are not “representative” of the Muslim community or “follow the Muslim faith.”\n \n\n   \n  A visibly miffed Mamdani responded by pointing out Cuomo hadn’t visited a mosque until after he lost in the Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  “It took me to get you to even see those Muslims as part of this city, and that frankly is something that is shameful,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s campaign also launched an effort called “Hindus for Cuomo,” with visits to Hindu mandirs, or temples, where he decries democratic socialism. And following others’ cues, he’s learned to bow and touch the floor when entering a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship.\n \n\n   \n  Aides to Cuomo believe he may be able to peel away some support among older, more conservative voters who tend to focus on public safety and education. They are hoping Cuomo’s promises to hire more officers and expand the city’s gifted and talented schools could pull some immigrant voters away from Mamdani, who has called for police reforms while disavowing his past calls to defund law enforcement and proposed narrowing gifted programs.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, an immigrant from Uganda, was raised by Indian parents in Manhattan and was 9 years old on September 11, 2001.\n \n\n   \n  He has spoken about how growing up in the post 9/11 world shaped his childhood, echoing a similar story told by thousands of children who were in school the morning of the attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “Zohran grew up in the shadow of 9/11,” Rahim, his senior adviser, said Thursday. “At the end of the day, this is New York City and New Yorkers are very familiar with garden-variety Islamophobia; they see it and reject it.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/india-mf-husain-art-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"1228-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00-10:24","title":"Why ‘India’s Picasso’ is breaking auction records — and enraging the Hindu right","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the complex legacy of M.F.

Husain, one of 20th-century India’s most important artists, this year has been a tale of two auctions.\n \n\n   \n  In March, one of the late painter’s monumental depictions of rural life, the 14-foot-long “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” became the  most expensive  modern Indian artwork ever to go under the hammer. The $13.75 million price tag almost doubled the previous record, with onlookers at Christie’s in New York bursting into spontaneous applause.\n \n\n   \n  Three months later, an auction of 25 long-lost Husain paintings in Mumbai was far less celebratory. Police  patrolled the premises  and erected barricades at the auctioneer’s office after a right-wing Hindu nationalist group  warned  of “strong public agitation” if calls to cancel the sale — due to Husain’s “vulgar and obscene” portrayals of sacred figures — were ignored.\n \n\n   \n  The auction went ahead without incident. But the contrasting moods exemplified the painter’s status as one of Indian art’s most celebrated but controversial names. As if to further underscore his polarized reputation, this year also saw a Delhi court order the seizure of two “offensive” Husain paintings, while, earlier this month, the Qatar Foundation announced plans for an entire  museum  dedicated to his work (Qatar had given   Husain citizenship after he fled India, in 2006, fearing for his safety).\n \n\n   \n  Known for bold, colorful explorations of folk and pop culture, Husain was lauded as a pioneer of Indian modernism and often dubbed “India’s Picasso.” His paintings played with icons in all their forms, from Mother Teresa and Indira Gandhi to Bollywood stars and mythological figures from literary epics.\n \n\n   \n  The artist’s portrayals of nude Hindu deities, however, stand accused of offending religious sentiments — a reaction his supporters believe is exacerbated by his Muslim heritage. As a result, his later life was dogged by protests, legal action, death threats and an arrest warrant. Despite later being exonerated by India’s supreme court, he died in self-imposed exile, in London, in 2011. In its statement opposing June’s Mumbai auction, right-wing group Hindu Janajagruti Samiti said that Husain “deliberately painted vulgar and obscene images of goddesses … thereby gravely hurting the sentiments of millions of Hindus in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The rekindling of old grievances, almost 15 years after his death, may be down to burgeoning interest from the global art market. But reactions to Husain’s work are also a bellwether of Hindu nationalism, according to Dr. Diva Gujral, an art history fellow at the University of Oxford’s Ruskin School of Art. While many of his most contentious works were produced in the 1970s, it is no coincidence that protests only erupted in 1990s, a decade when the Hindutva ideology flourished, communal tensions deepened and, Gujral said, Muslims became “a lightning rod” in India.\n \n\n   \n  “The reception of Husain is such a good litmus test for Indian cultural politics, because there are times when it wasn’t controversial,” she added, calling the reactions a “way to take the temperature of the country.”\n \n\n   \n    Icons past and present\n \n\n   \n  Hailing from an Indian branch of the Sulaymani Bohras, a Muslim sect residing primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, Husain was exposed to both Hindu and Islamic art from a young age.\n \n\n   \n  He was born in 1915 in Pandharpur, a pilgrimage town dotted with Hindu temples in western India. After his mother’s death, he was sent to study Urdu and Islamic calligraphy at his grandfather’s madrassa in  Sidhpur , Gujarat. Husain later lived in the city of Indore and immersed himself in folk traditions, like performances of the Hindu epic “Ramayana,” before enrolling in art lessons at the local art institute. In 1934, he sold his first painting on a roadside for 10 rupees.\n \n\n   \n  His interest in iconography always stretched far beyond religion. In his early 20s, Husain moved to Mumbai to paint billboards for the nascent Hindi film industry. It would prove a formative experience — one that shaped his fascination with contemporary idols and Bollywood, as well as his penchant for vivid colors and flattened, figurative forms.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in 1947, came another decisive moment in the artist’s life: India’s independence from colonial rule and Britain’s partition of the subcontinent into a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Partly inspired by the religious strife that ensued, the painter co-founded the Bombay Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), alongside major figures like F.N. Souza and S.H. Raza, later that year.\n \n\n   \n  The avant-garde group sought to forge a new visual language of — and for — India. Rejecting revivalist nationalism, its members fused local art traditions with outside influences, especially those of European modernists like Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Matisse (though Husain also traveled to China in the early 1950s), as they interrogated their country’s emerging identity.\n \n\n   \n  “It was about creating something new, breaking with the past,” said Gujra adding that the group did more than “simply take” from Western art. “They’re reinvigorating a language that’s made available to them through access to places like London and Paris. But it’s very much their own thing.”\n \n\n   \n  For Husain, this meant a Cubist-inspired style rooted firmly in the Indian experience. It is an approach epitomized by the record-breaking “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” which he produced in 1954, though it went largely unseen for seven decades before going on sale at Christie’s this year. The narrative painting comprises 13 vibrant vignettes, each containing a snippet of rural life. Abstracted villagers are depicted working the land, milling grain and tending to livestock. Elsewhere, a farmer symbolically reaches out of his portrait’s frame to hold up a landscape in a neighboring vignette.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s literally the farmer supporting the land, and supporting the state and the nation,” said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian modern and contemporary art at Christie’s. “This is Husain’s way of saying that, while we may be modernizing, post-independence, and entering this new era, it’s very important not to forget that the basis of the country is its rural folk.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the public attention Husain’s later work attracted, his most valuable paintings emerged during this early period, Avari said. “He’s playing this critical role of defining what it is to be an Indian artist in the new country of India, and what Indian modern art really means,” he added. “He’s a linchpin figure in defining this moment.”\n \n\n   \n  As many of Husain’s contemporaries moved overseas (including Souza and Raza, who relocated to the UK and France, respectively), the painter remained in India, his eternal muse. He nonetheless enjoyed some global recognition, exhibiting in New York City in 1964 and participating in the 1971 São Paulo Biennial in Brazil alongside Picasso. This period also saw Husain exploring female forms, including images of Hindu goddesses like Durga and Lakshmi, sometimes in suggestive or erotic poses.\n \n\n   \n  Husain maintained that he never intended to degrade these deities. His subjects were not the goddesses themselves, but their iconography — how they appeared in temple art, sculptures and friezes. Their nudity was drawn from Indian art history, not his imagination, though the paintings were nonetheless viewed by some critics as a “kind of desacralizing act,” said the University of Oxford’s Gujra.\n \n\n   \n  “In Hindu nationalist politics, the bogeyman is the Muslim invader who outrages the modesty of the Hindu woman,” she said. “For a lot of your average Indian viewers who didn’t have an enduring understanding of the nude and its art historical heritage… he becomes the Muslim disrobing the Hindu woman.”\n \n\n   \n  “It reignited old ideas of the Muslim taking what isn’t his,” she added. “But the idea for Husain is that this heritage belongs to all of us.”\n \n\n   \n    Fundamentalist reprisals\n \n\n   \n  The entire 1980s passed before the paintings faced significant religious backlash. In that time, Husain was even welcomed into the political establishment as a member of the Indian parliament’s upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where he served until 1992.\n \n\n   \n  But everything changed in the fall of 1996, when a Hindu monthly magazine, Vichar Mimansa, published the artist’s nude depiction of the goddess Saraswati alongside an article headlined “M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher.” The incident led to multiple  criminal complaints  against Husain, who was then aged in his early 80s, beginning a chain of events that led to his self-imposed exile.\n \n\n   \n  In 1998, Hindu fundamentalists attacked Husain’s Mumbai home and galleries displaying his work. Eight years later, another hardline group offered a 510-million-rupee (then $11.5 million) cash reward for his murder. The protests stretched beyond India’s borders, too, with London’s Asia House controversially canceling an exhibition of Husain’s work in 2006, citing security concerns, after Hindu groups demanded its closure and vandals defaced two of his paintings.\n \n\n   \n  That year, a court in Indore issued an arrest warrant for Husain. The offending image, this time, was a more recent painting that reimagined the map of India as a naked woman on her knees, city names marking her body. The artist publicly apologized for causing offense and denied giving it the name “Bharat Mata” — or Mother India, a personification of the nation — claiming the work was untitled. This did little to appease his critics.\n \n\n   \n  Concerned for his safety and facing hundreds — or as he  later suggested,  thousands — of legal cases, Husain left India in 2006. The Delhi High Court and, later, India’s Supreme Court eventually rejected calls for Husain’s summons and cleared him of obscenity charges, effectively quashing cases in other cities. In its ruling, in 2008, the Supreme Court criticized the emergence of a “new puritanism” in India, stating that erotic sculptures were a common sight in Hindu temples. Yet, Husain never felt it was safe to return to the country again.\n \n\n   \n  His plight meanwhile became a rallying cry for supporters of Indian secularism. Novelist Salman Rushdie was among those to  criticize  the Indian government for its “inadequate” protection of Husain and the freedom of expression he represented. “Violence and its ugly sisters, both Hindu and Islamic, have to be resisted,” Rushdie said at an address in Delhi in 2010. “They must be rebuffed. To appease it is the best way to ensure their growth. I am afraid India is going that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Husain spent most of his final years in Dubai, Doha and London. Upon surrendering his Indian passport to apply for Qatari citizenship, he is reported to have said: “India is my motherland, and I simply cannot leave that country. What I have surrendered is just a piece of paper.”\n \n\n   \n  He also often spoke of his desire to return home — including to his friend Abhishek Poddar, a prominent collector and founder of Bangalore’s Museum of Art & Photography, who regularly mailed Husain his favorite Indore newspaper. “His love was India, and he always missed India,” said Poddar. “I once said, ‘What is it that you miss? And he said, ‘What I really miss is the earth there. The mud.’”\n \n\n   \n    Master showman\n \n\n   \n  Husain’s goddess paintings were just a fraction of his life’s work. Even the most conservative estimates put his total output at 30,000 to 40,000 artworks, spanning printmaking, writing and filmmaking of both the arthouse and Bollywood variety. He was similarly prolific after leaving India: In 2007, he completed 51 paintings inspired by the Bollywood classic “Mughal-e-Azam,” and was, at the time of his death, working on a series of 99 artworks, reflecting the 99 names of Allah, telling the history of Arab civilization.\n \n\n   \n  “He needed to paint all the time,” said Poddar, who first met Husain as the artist waited for a lift, without shoes, at a Kolkata bus stop in the early 1980s. (The 57-year-old collector, then a teenage art enthusiast, approached Husain after recognizing his flowing white beard from a weekly magazine, and the pair struck up an unlikely friendship.) “I once saw him at his London property where he had between 25 and 30 works. I met him again two or three days later, and lo and behold, there were another 12 or 13.”\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been at least a dozen occasions when he’s sitting with me and he’s drawing somebody’s portrait,” added Poddar, who holds several Husain works in his museum’s collection.\n \n\n   \n  Husain painted anywhere and everywhere. Renowned as a showman, he even painted during live performances and immediately auctioned off the resulting works. Taking commissions from Gulf royals and industrialist billionaires, he was something of an art-world celebrity, his distinctive appearance, designer suits and reputation for walking around shoeless all part of his own icon-building.\n \n\n   \n  “He was known as the barefoot artist,” said Avari, the Christie’s specialist. “He made that a thing. He would walk around with this very long paint brush, using it as a cane. There was no mistaking the figure of Husain wherever he went.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know anybody who doesn’t have a Husain story,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But if Husain was, to use Poddar’s words, a “brilliant marketing man,” is it plausible that he had attempted to exploit religious outrage to serve his own ends? Gujra described the painter as a “contrarian” who “definitely liked controversy,” though she suggests he would neither have intended nor anticipated the reaction his work provoked. “He was interested in mass images,” she explained.\n \n\n   \n  Poddar meanwhile argued that his fiercely secular friend treated Hindu icons the same as all his other subjects. In fact, Husain was also accused of blasphemy by Islamic groups over a song in his 2004 movie “Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities,” as its lyrics used words directly from the Quran.\n \n\n   \n  “If there were a pantheon of figures associated with Islam, I don’t think he would have looked at that any differently from the way he looked at Christianity, Sikhism, Hinduism or whatever else,” said Poddar.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think he ever had an anti-Hindu agenda,” he added. “Ever.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/weather/tropical-storm-hurricane-melissa-caribbean-track","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:19:00-04:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Forecast to Become Major Hurricane, Threatening Jamaica and Haiti","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane, potentially reaching Category 3 or higher by Monday, due to warm ocean waters and slow movement.

The longer it lingers, the more rain it dumps and the more likely it is to rapidly intensify into a monster storm.\n \n\n   \n  Intensity forecasts have ramped up considerably in the past few days. A worst-case scenario for some Caribbean islands is increasingly likely with Melissa set to reach at least Category 4 hurricane strength next week, fueled by extremely warm water.\n \n\n   \n  A tropical storm warning is in effect for Jamaica with Melissa’s outermost winds expected to reach there in the next day or so. Hurricane watches are in effect for Jamaica and parts of Haiti, meaning hurricane-force winds are possible by the weekend. Haiti, Jamaica and parts of the Dominican Republic face days of heavy rain that threaten significant flash flooding and dangerous mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica could end up being the epicenter of the worst Melissa has to offer, based on current forecasts. Preparations were well underway in the country Thursday as officials urged residents to take Melissa seriously and stay vigilant.\n \n\n   \n  All public hospitals are set to go into “emergency mode” Thursday evening, Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness confirmed at  a news conference . This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, Minister of Science, Energy, Telecommunications and Transport.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday evening, Melissa was about 165 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 45 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s drifting north-northwest at just 2 mph, slower than the average person on an afternoon stroll.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is forecast to reach hurricane strength by the weekend and will likely rapidly intensify into a  major hurricane  — Category 3 or greater — Monday.

 10:20 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink devices being used by cyber scam syndicates operating in a lawless corner of Myanmar, the   Elon Musk-led company said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite regional authorities’ highly publicized  crackdowns on the cyberfraud centers  along Myanmar’s border with Thailand this year, the scamming networks have continued to proliferate in the civil war-afflicted nation.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX said it works to identify violations in all markets where Starlink operates.\n \n\n   \n  “On the rare occasion we identify a violation, we take appropriate action, including working with law enforcement agencies around the world,” said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX’s vice president of business operations for Starlink, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “In Myanmar, for example, SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected ‘scam centers’.”\n \n\n   \n  Dreyer did not provide a date for when the consoles were disabled, but the announcement comes after the Myanmar military junta said it discovered 30 sets of Starlink “receivers and accessories” during a raid on one such scam compound this week.\n \n\n   \n  There are about 30 sprawling, purpose-built compounds dotted along the Myanmar-Thai border that are dedicated to scamming victims, including Americans, out of billions of dollars every year, according to  a recent report  by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Workers in the scam centers are often lured by the promise of well-paid jobs,  or trafficked, and are routinely held against their will and forced to carry out online fraud schemes in the heavily guarded compounds, where former detainees have  previously told CNN  beatings and torture are common.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, concerns have been raised by the United States that criminal networks in Myanmar were using Starlink to access the internet and carry out their scams.\n \n\n   \n  Starlink has more than 6 million global users, according to its website. It provides high-speed internet service using a network of thousands of satellites at low-Earth orbit, enabling it to reach remote communities.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the news agency Agence France-Presse this month found that Starlink receivers had been installed on the roofs of the scam compounds at a “huge scale.”\n \n\n   \n  The US Congress Joint Economic Committee has begun an investigation into Starlink’s alleged involvement in the centers, according to the AFP investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The move by SpaceX comes as the global scam industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, with criminal groups adopting  artificial intelligence  and using online cryptocurrency markets to move vast amounts of stolen money undetected.\n \n\n   \n  Southeast Asia is a hotspot for these romance or investment scams known as “pig butchering,” named for the practice of fattening up prey before the slaughter. And Myanmar has become an attractive destination for the cybercrime networks, who are shielded by corruption and the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  Kristalyn, from the Phillipines, said she was working in KK Park, a notorious scam compound near Myawaddy, a border town in southeast Myanmar, when the internet was cut at around noon on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “In the morning the Chinese boss came into our office and told us to return to our rooms,” she told CNN, requesting to use only her first name for safety reasons.\n \n\n   \n  “But not long after, he came back in again and told us to just leave the place,” added Kristalyn, who said she had been working there since July.\n \n\n   \n  She and around 200 other Filipinos, along with others from India, Pakistan and several African countries, were waiting near the border with Thailand and trying to cross over, she told CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of us are staying in abandoned houses, buildings and even some are just staying on the streets trying to cross the border. We have no food here. We have no money at all.”\n \n\n   \n    Civil war\n \n\n   \n  Since taking power in a 2021 coup, the military administration – which does not control all of the country – has fought a civil war against a patchwork of anti-junta and regional ethnic groups.\n \n\n   \n  In February, Thailand  cut electricity supplies  to several areas in Myanmar that are home to the scam sites, to try and disrupt their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, about 7,000 workers and victims  were released  from scam centers along the border and repatriated in a major operation by Thai authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Between January 30 and October 19, Myanmar’s military junta said it had arrested 9,551 foreign nationals from the scam compounds, repatriating most of them.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have warned that represents a tiny fraction of people trapped and working in the centers.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Monday its raid on KK Park uncovered more than 2,000 workers.\n \n\n   \n  Footage filmed for CNN from inside KK Park in April shows paved roads lined with trees and manicured lawns, giving the image of a legitimate business district, complete with a hotel and billboards advertising gambling sites.\n \n\n   \n  But a source who works in the anti-human-trafficking field told CNN the raid on KK Park has not stopped operations.\n \n\n   \n  While the impact of ceasing Starlink operations “is not nothing,” there were still “many victims trapped inside” other buildings of the compound   who “confirmed last night they’re still being forced to scam,” said the source.\n \n\n   \n  Transnational crime expert Jason Tower said the military raid on KK Park was “more of a publicity stunt than a crackdown” and that it was “business as usual” for dozens of scam compounds still operating along the Moei River that separates Myanmar and Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  “With international attention and outrage over Southeast Asia’s scamdemic rising, the Myanmar military is trying to skirt accountability for transforming the Myanmar-Thailand border lands into a hub for criminality,” said Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n \n\n   \n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations meets for a summit later this week in Malaysia, and the scourge of scam centers is likely to be a top issue on the agenda. “The military is also trying to position itself as continuing to take action on this issue,” Tower said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive  law enforcement operation  by the US and UK that recently targeted a Cambodian criminal scam network “likely pushed China to increase pressure once again on the Myanmar military regime to take further action,” Tower added.\n \n\n   \n  “It is also likely that the Myanmar military seeks to establish more direct control over some of the scam centers, as it realizes just how much illicit revenue is being brought in by this extremely lucrative form of criminal activity,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the military junta for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/supreme-court-liberals-nitrogen-hypoxia-executions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:04:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Liberals Decry 'Excruciating Suffocation' in Nitrogen Hypoxia Executions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a rare and strong dissent, three liberal justices of the U.S. Supreme Court — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson — condemned nitrogen hypoxia executions as a form of 'excruciating suffocation' and 'psychological terror,' arguing that the method violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

liberals decry ‘excruciating suffocation’ in nitrogen hypoxia executions \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:04 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court’s three liberal justices on Thursday laid out a remarkable critique of  nitrogen hypoxia executions , asserting that the new form of capital punishment causes “psychological terror” and “excruciating suffocation”   in the condemned and likely violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s senior liberal, encouraged Americans to start a stopwatch on their phones and reflect as the seconds turn into minutes.\n \n\n   \n  “Now imagine for that entire time, you are suffocating,” Sotomayor wrote in  her dissent , which was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “You want to breathe; you have to breathe. But you are strapped to a gurney with a mask on your face pumping your lungs with nitrogen gas.”\n \n\n   \n  “Your mind knows that the gas will kill you,” she continued. “But your body keeps telling you to breathe.”\n \n\n   \n  Sotomayor’s striking dissent came in the case of Anthony Boyd, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995 for the brutal killing of Gregory Huguley in Alabama. Huguley was duct-taped to a bench, doused with gasoline, and burned alive over a $200 drug debt, according to court records.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court declined to pause Boyd’s execution, and, as is almost always the case in emergency death penalty cases, the majority did not explain its decision. Capital cases almost always come up to the Supreme Court days – and sometimes hours – before the scheduled execution.\n \n\n   \n  Boyd was executed later Thursday, according to Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  Five states have authorized the use of nitrogen hypoxia as a form of execution, but only Alabama and Louisiana have used the method so far. Early last year, the  Supreme Court allowed Alabama  to execute an inmate with the procedure for the first time. The two states have used nitrogen hypoxia to execute seven people.\n \n\n   \n  The new method was partly a response to many pharmaceutical companies declining to allow their drugs to be used in lethal injections.\n \n\n   \n  But use of nitrogen gas in executions, Sotomayor wrote, has demonstrated that the method is “not at all what it was promised to be.” It takes at least two minutes and possibly as many as seven to lose consciousness, Sotomayor wrote – “that is, up to seven full minutes of conscious, excruciating suffocation.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd had asked to be killed by firing squad instead.\n \n\n   \n  “The Constitution would grant him that grace,” Sotomayor wrote. “My colleagues do not. This court thus turns its back on Boyd and on the Eighth Amendment’s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-putin-russia-reversal-sanctions-summit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:19:00-04:00","title":"How Trump’s plans for a Budapest summit with Putin turned into sanctions on Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump canceled a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, citing a lack of meaningful progress in ending the war in Ukraine.

turned into sanctions on Russia \n       \n  By Kristen Holmes, Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:19 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump hung up the phone after his talk with Russia’s Vladimir Putin last week, he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced he was heading soon to Budapest for an in-person summit.\n \n\n   \n  Five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  — the first of Trump’s second administration — were on.\n \n\n   \n  What happened in between was a steady realization by the president and top officials that Putin’s stance on ending the war had not significantly shifted from the last time  the two met on a US air base in Alaska , according to US officials.\n \n\n   \n  Putin’s  continued strikes  on civilians in Ukraine, his maximalist demands on Kyiv to bring the war to an end and his refusal to agree to an immediate ceasefire all added up, in Trump’s mind, to a clear signal that nothing really had changed.\n \n\n   \n  “It just it didn’t feel right to me,” Trump said Wednesday. “It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it.”\n \n\n   \n  The wholesale reversal was cheered by Trump’s European allies and many of the president’s supporters, and condemned as unhelpful by Putin. After months of threatening new measures on Russia, only to stop short, Trump has now gone further than ever before in punishing the country for its war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt it was time,” Trump said at the White House moments after the new sanctions were announced. “We waited a long time.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Good conversations’ that ‘don’t go anywhere’\n \n\n   \n  Whether Trump’s new stance is permanent, or simply a temporary phase, is an open question. He has  repeatedly zigzagged  in his approach to Putin since returning to office, often influenced by his phone conversations with the Russian leader. And new pressure on global oil prices could test his willingness to withstand the potential fallout for American consumers.\n \n\n   \n  There was no single moment that shifted the president’s thinking, according to a senior White House official. Instead, his view evolved as he found himself repeatedly disappointed that Putin appeared no closer to agreeing to end the war.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump complained Wednesday. “They just don’t go anywhere.”\n \n\n   \n  A day after his call with Putin, Trump met over lunch in the Cabinet Room with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  The meeting was tense , and the Ukrainians left having failed to secure the long-range Tomahawk missiles they’d been seeking.\n \n\n   \n  But while Trump pressed Zelensky to agree to land concessions that would bring the war to a close, by the end of the meeting he’d arrived at a plan that would call for a ceasefire at the current battle lines — well short of what Putin has demanded for peace.\n \n\n   \n  After a phone call Monday between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, it was clear to American officials that Moscow’s stance hadn’t significantly shifted, despite what Trump believed to be a positive conversation with Putin four days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  The Budapest summit he’d hoped to arrange in a couple of weeks might be a “waste of time,” Trump speculated. Planning was halted.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the announcement of the new sanctions on Wednesday, Trump sat down for a meeting where the topic arose with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been a proponent of imposing sanctions on Russia for months.\n \n\n   \n  This time, the president surprised even some of his closest advisers by agreeing to impose sanctions on Russia’s largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Bessent returned to his office at Treasury to brief his team and compile the new sanctions into a release.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly afterward, Trump spoke to Rubio — who was preparing to depart for a trip to Israel — and advised him that they would be imposing the sanctions immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Back at the White House, Bessent teased the impending announcement in a roundabout way. After speaking with reporters in the driveway, he was walking back into the West Wing before he spun around and returned to the microphones.\n \n\n   \n  “We are going to either announce after the close this afternoon — or first thing tomorrow morning — a substantial pickup in Russia sanctions,” he said as reporters scrambled to get their cameras back into place.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the building, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who made the last-minute journey from Brussels as an emissary for European leaders hoping Trump would remain on Ukraine’s side.\n \n\n   \n  Rutte could hardly have hoped for a better outcome, as Trump spelled out his sudden decision to make good on a threat he’d been alluding to  for months.\n \n\n   \n  “These are very big, those are against their two big oil companies, and we hope that they won’t be on for long. We hope that the war will be settled,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n    Surprise within the White House\n \n\n   \n  Even many inside the White House were surprised how quickly the new package of sanctions came together. Trump had told advisers for months that one day he would decide it was time to take stronger action on Russia. The president suggested to advisers that his “instincts” were telling him it was time to move in a different direction with Putin.\n \n\n   \n  “It was the culmination of having good calls [with Putin] and then reading the papers and seeing Russia is still” bombing Ukraine extensively, the senior White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  Hours before the announcement, Russia struck a Ukrainian kindergarten building in Kharkiv. Video from the scene showed terrified people running from the burning building, clutching screaming children.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was also motivated by the truce  he helped broker in Gaza , believing it only came together after he had grown increasingly tough on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “Getting tough led to action,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has received repeated calls from Sen. Lindsey Graham, along with other Republican allies, encouraging him to impose sanctions. After joining Trump for lunch in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters he wanted to bring a long-delayed sanctions bill to the floor “when the White House believes it’s useful to them to get Putin to the table and to get a deal that ends the war, so we’re prepared to act.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to do everything we can to support the president, his team’s efforts and the efforts of our allies to bring the bloodshed to an end and a peaceful conclusion,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in the days after he retook office in January, Trump has held out the option of using sanctions to force Putin to the negotiating table. He said on January 22, two days after he was inaugurated and one day after his onetime deadline to end the war, that he may have no choice than to “put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” on Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  The threats continued through the spring and summer, but never materialized into new measures. Trump privately said he was concerned that tough new sanctions might push Putin further away from peace talks, officials have said – a viewpoint his top diplomat echoed in August.\n \n\n   \n  “The minute you issue new sanctions … our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished,” Rubio said in an interview around the time Trump met Putin in Alaska.\n \n\n   \n  Trump did apply new tariffs on India as punishment for its purchases of Russian oil. But he didn’t slap similar measures on Moscow’s largest customer, China, as he works to broker a new trade deal with  President Xi Jinping .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not ruled out meeting Putin at some point in the future when he feels the time is right.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president and the entire administration hopes that one day that can happen again,” White House   press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday. “But we want to make sure that there’s a tangible, positive outcome out of that meeting, and that it’s a good use of the president’s time.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/construction-workers-east-wing-ndas","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"19:50:00-04:00","title":"Mum’s the word from workers on East Wing demolition, including some who say they’ve signed NDAs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House is undergoing the demolition of its East Wing, a project that has drawn intense public scrutiny and criticism from historic preservation groups and political figures.

NDAs \n       \n  By Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:50 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Construction workers in lime green vests, hoodies and hard hats who have spent the last several days clearing the White House’s East Wing departed through the Treasury grounds on their way out for lunch break Thursday, passing camera crews and journalists who have been capturing their work since  demolition began earlier this week . But they remained tight-lipped about their role in a project that has enthralled the American public.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not allowed to answer questions,” one worker said.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything has to go through the White House press office,” said another.\n \n\n   \n  Some even said they signed non-disclosure agreements.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN that is routine practice. After all, the workers who operate excavators and otherwise clear the wreckage have a close-up view of facilities that house the officials who run the US government. “There is nothing unusual about requiring workers to sign NDAs, and it is standard,” the White House official told CNN, adding that certain contractors are required to have security clearances because “there are aspects of the project that deal with operational security on campus.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has been under a microscope since excavators were caught on camera tearing down the East Wing Monday, with historic preservation groups  calling for a stop to the demolition  and President Donald Trump’s critics asserting he had not been fully open about just how much would be destroyed in the process of building a new multi-million dollar ballroom on the grounds. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, called it “a metaphor for broader, reckless destruction” within the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “For anyone who has worked at the WH, or cares about its rich history, it’s a gut punch,” Axelrod posted on X.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has asserted it was transparent all along. When  the project was first announced , images showed the ballroom in place of the East Wing. And during a dinner with donors to the ballroom effort last week, Trump turned away from the podium in the East Room, had the gold curtains opened and showed dinner attendees a glimpse of the East Wing outside.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything out there is coming down, and we’re replacing it with one of the most beautiful ballrooms that you’ve ever seen,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also noted it isn’t the first to make changes, pointing to past construction projects by prior presidents. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt flipped through photos of some of those endeavors, including the construction of the West Wing and West Terrace in 1902.\n \n\n   \n  “These images look quite similar to what you and the American people are seeing today,” Leavitt said, adding that many presidents have “made their mark” on the White House complex.\n \n\n   \n  But even Trump himself noted from the Oval Office Wednesday, “This obviously would be the biggest change.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration has previously raised security concerns over information about  the demolition . Earlier this week, a Treasury spokesperson confirmed the agency had urged employees against sharing images of the construction for that reason, after images surfaced on Monday that could have been taken from Treasury grounds. That facility sits directly next to the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  “Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details. Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images,” a Treasury spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the construction is impossible to keep completely out of public view. It can be seen — and heard — from the North Lawn of the White House, 15th street and atop higher buildings in DC. Videos and still images of the swift demolition have filled social media and news networks, some met with incredulity and outrage. Some have pointed to Trump’s past comments that seemed to downplay the impact.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s being built over on the east side, and it will be beautiful views of the Washington Monument. It won’t interfere with the current building. It’ll be near it, but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of; it’s my favorite place,”  Trump said,  speaking to reporters in the Roosevelt Room.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how long the building of the ballroom will actually take, but  the White House  said it’s “expected to be completed long before the end of President Trump’s term.” The president himself said, “We’ll get it built quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to McCrery Architects and Clark Construction, which the White House has said are leading the projet, for comment but not yet received a response.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/adam-schiff-investigation-donald-trump-ed-martin","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:27:00-04:00","title":"Prosecutors are hesitant to charge Trump foe Adam Schiff, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prosecutors in Maryland are hesitant to file charges against Democratic Senator Adam Schiff over alleged mortgage fraud, despite pressure from Trump-aligned Justice Department official Ed Martin.

its own antisemitism \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:52 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance last week presented the Republican Party and the conservative movement with a fork in the road. They could either denounce the increasing examples of racist, antisemitic and extremist rhetoric in their ranks, or they could  whatabout  them away.\n \n\n   \n  Vance  suggested the latter course . Responding to newly published  vile text messages  from Republican officials and staff, he pointed to violent texts from Democratic Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones.\n \n\n   \n  “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  The approach made political sense. The Trump administration is in the process of  misleadingly painting  the political left as more violent and extreme than the right – this despite  years of data  to the contrary and  court rulings rejecting its characterizations .\n \n\n   \n  But increasingly, prominent conservatives are rejecting Vance’s tack.\n \n\n   \n  They’re arguing that those texts and other revelations betray a very real and growing problem in their ranks, and that looking the other way just isn’t an option. They’ve cast it as a moral, political and even a quite literal hazard.\n \n\n   \n    The growing calls for an internal reckoning\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered some of the most significant comments to date this week. He cited a  “growing cancer” and “poison” of antisemitism on the right .\n \n\n   \n  “I’m here to tell you in the last six months, I have seen antisemitism rising on the right in a way I have never seen it in my entire life,” Cruz said Tuesday at the 45th Annual Night to Honor Israel in San Antonio, adding that “the church is asleep right now.”\n \n\n   \n  While he argued the problem has been worse on the left, he said it was foolish to ignore it on the right. He cited the oodles of antisemitic responses he gets on social media and said it wasn’t just bots funded by foreign governments.\n \n\n   \n  “I am telling you this is real, it is organic, these are real human beings, and it is spreading,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of other conservative influencers have made similar arguments over the past week, in some cases explicitly rejecting calls like Vance’s to stay focused on the left, even if they didn’t specifically call out the vice president.\n \n\n   \n  Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro appeared with an advocate of Vance’s approach and warned that the right was “ sort of whistling past the graveyard .”\n \n\n   \n  Shapiro, who is Jewish, said threats he’s received from the right have become “more common.”\n \n\n   \n  “If somebody tries to kill me, it’s a fricking Agatha Christie novel,” Shapiro said. “I just don’t know which direction the bullet is coming from at this point, given the sort of various and sundry radical extremes that exist.”\n \n\n   \n  Those fears about extremism leading to violence became more real this week. The state of Florida arrested a man for  allegedly threatening to kill Dillon and other Jewish conservatives . Dillon and others who were allegedly targeted by the man linked the threats to a baseless conspiracy theory promoted by far-right influencers that Israel was behind Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n \n\n   \n  “Some on the right are spreading these ideas,” Dillon  said . “Others, to their shame, are either afraid or unwilling to confront them.”\n \n\n   \n    The GOP’s dilemma\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, that particular conspiracy theory – about Israel supposedly being involved in Kirk’s assassination – crystallizes the GOP’s political dilemma.\n \n\n   \n  Former Daily Wire host Candace Owens has played  a massive role in spreading  it via her hugely popular podcast. Some on the right have  accused Tucker Carlson of flirting with it . That includes in his eulogy for Kirk when he compared his assassination to those who plotted to kill Jesus – whom Carlson called “guys sitting around eating hummus” in Jerusalem. ( Carlson said  on his show this month that claims that he was being antisemitic in the eulogy are “insane,” adding, “All I did was recount the gospel.”)\n \n\n   \n  But despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly denouncing the theory early on, the American right has been slow to address it. Some on the right have  criticized former Fox News host Megyn Kelly  for declining to call out Owens and Carlson, whose broader commentary about Jews and Israel has also  raised alarm bells among Republicans like Cruz .\n \n\n   \n  Kelly has offered  a Vance-ian defense  for her posture, saying she’s not interested in rocking the boat.\n \n\n   \n    A problem that’s getting harder to ignore\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have largely ignored the Owens situation, but there seems to be a growing recognition on the right that not calling out this kind of rhetoric  is also politically fraught.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, Democrats have their problems here, including Jones’ texts and the recent controversy over popular Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner having  a tattoo that resembled Nazi imagery . (Platner has said he didn’t understand the image was tied to Nazism.)\n \n\n   \n  But the evidence of this problem on the right – and perhaps most notably, its penetration of official circles – is also building.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the vile text messages shared by a group of young Republicans on a group chat.  Trump nominee Paul Ingrassia, who, in his own private messages, allegedly said he had “ a Nazi streak ” and made racist comments, was recently withdrawn after some GOP senators pushed back.\n \n\n   \n  There have been other Trump appointees and nominees with  extreme  and  inflammatory social media histories , as often documented by CNN’s KFile. And Trump appointees and GOP members of Congress who  appeared at gatherings   of white nationalists . A Ron DeSantis presidential campaign aide in 2023 shared a  video with a neo-Nazi symbol .\n \n\n   \n  And that’s to say nothing of Trump’s history here. That includes his downplaying of a racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, his frequent  use of antisemitic tropes , and his comment, according to his former chief of staff John Kelly, that  Adolf Hitler did some “good things.”  (A Trump spokesman has denied this comment.)\n \n\n   \n  Conservative New York Times opinion columnist David French in  a 2023 column  highlighted a number of other examples of this phenomenon and warned the right of this sleeping giant of an issue.\n \n\n   \n  “We should expect more bigotry and more revelations,” French wrote. “Dark words spoken in secret will spill out into the public square. The lost boys of the American right corrupt our culture.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s proven rather prescient. And the right is now being forced to reckon with it more out in the open, even as the administration would prefer to avert its gaze and focus on more politically advantageous matters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/stunning-nba-gambling-charges-reveal-the-sports-gambling-reckoning-is-already-here","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"19:23:00-04:00","title":"Stunning NBA charges reveal the sports gambling reckoning is already here","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal indictment alleges that former NBA player Damon Jones shared insider information about LeBron James' absence from a game with co-conspirators, enabling illegal betting.

   \n  By Dana O'Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:23 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Deep in the weeds of the 23-page federal indictment  alleging game fixing in the NBA , prosecutors cite a text from former NBA journeyman Damon Jones to his co-conspirators.\n \n\n   \n  “Get a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out! (Player 3) is out tonight. Bet enough so Djones can eat to (sic) now!”\n \n\n   \n  Player 3, it turns out, was LeBron James, whose absence in the Los Angeles Lakers game could understandably affect the outcome. James did not, in fact, play that night which Jones knew because – though he wasn’t an official part of the Lakers staff – he worked with the NBA star during pre-game workouts.\n \n\n   \n   Access equals information , which is, essentially, how the sausage is made in point-shaving.\n \n\n   \n  Much like insider trading on the stock market, inside information on teams – either from peripheral personnel such as Jones, or in the form of a direct link, a la Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier – can be worth a lot of money. And for the co-conspirators it was, including two people indicted in the case involving Rozier.\n \n\n   \n  Shane Hennen and Marves Fairley are career criminals with serious charges on their lengthy rap  sheets . Hennen spent 30 months in prison for intent to distribute cocaine and was separately arrested for assault after stabbing someone. Fairley was accused in 2018 of murdering a man in witness protection. The judge, however, cited a “number of matters involving the defendant, state and others,’’ and he was given a 15-year suspended sentence with no time served.\n \n\n   \n  Now set that aside temporarily and consider all of this under the backdrop of the NCAA’s Wednesday decision to allow student-athletes to gamble on professional sports.\n \n\n   \n  Cursed by undeniable bad timing,  the national body announced just 24 hours before the indictments  that it was reversing its long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from betting on sports in which an NCAA championship is wagered. Though they still cannot wager on college sports, as of November 1 student-athletes are free to gamble on professionals.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA’s argument for its about-face is that the world has changed significantly, and it has. At the 2009 Final Four in Detroit, North Carolina guard Ty Lawson decided to take advantage of his head coach’s lenient 1:30 a.m. curfew. He took a quick walk from the team hotel to the nearby casino in the city’s famous Greektown and promptly won $250 at the craps table. He shared the news the next day at a media session when asked if he had any luck at the casinos.\n \n\n   \n  Knickers were twisted and pearls clutched. The NCAA at the time had an uncomfortable relationship with the very concept of gambling, with the organization’s then-president, Myles Brand, going so far as to say that while he couldn’t stop athletes from playing church bingo, he wasn’t going to encourage it, either.\n \n\n   \n  Which now seems so quaint to be almost silly.\n \n\n   \n  Sports gambling is now permissible in some 30 states and online gambling, for better or worse, is everywhere on college campuses. In reversing its stance, the NCAA argued that limiting the betting rules would allow college athletes to “better align with their campus peers.’’\n \n\n   \n  But while a sophomore physics major might have the scoop on what his or her former pal who graduated last year is doing in the lab, no one is terribly interested in shaking them down for that information. But a junior who played in the backcourt alongside a first-round draft pick a year earlier? A different story.\n \n\n   \n  Even without intent, a college athlete, student manager or staff member could innocently be handed a tip that could turn profitable – an innocuous text about a turned ankle or a chat during an Xbox game about an All-Star teammate who just cinched his back might mean thousands to someone.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than trying to legislate ethics, the NCAA is standing on law. Sharing such information is already illegal so, without sounding flippant, it is taking the same approach some have taken toward preventing teen pregnancy. Recognizing that abstinence is improbable, they’ve turned toward education.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA has blanketed campuses with educational programs via in-person workshops and seminars and created several online resources. It’s partnered with outside groups to monitor online abuse and threats, and it’s pushed states to eliminate prop bets involving college games. To date four (Ohio, Vermont, Maryland and Louisiana) have banned them and two others (New Jersey and North Carolina) have initiated legislation to eliminate them.\n \n\n   \n   It is nearly impossible to eliminate sports gambling,  especially with the proliferation and easy availability of apps, and rather than seek punitive damages for making mistakes, the NCAA hopes it can teach its athletes what not to do.\n \n\n   \n  Still, that asks a lot of college kids, especially when the mixed messages are everywhere. Consider that longtime broadcaster Brent Musburger got summoned to the ESPN offices for referring to an over/under during a college football game, and now game breaks are littered with ads from FanDuel and DraftKings, and the network has its own sportsbook, ESPNBet.\n \n\n   \n  Less than 20 years after Lawson made legal bets at the Detroit casino, 18 teams will convene over Thanksgiving week for the Players Era Tournament. The games will be played at MGM Grand Garden Arena, in the MGM Resort on the Las Vegas Strip.\n \n\n   \n  And if NBA players who make millions can be lured – Rozier is in the last year of a more than $90-million contract – imagine the susceptibility of college students. They are easy marks, equal parts naive and eager for cash.\n \n\n   \n   Just last month, the NCAA announced it, too,  was knee deep in a game-fixing investigation. NCAA enforcement officials were looking at 13 college basketball players from six different schools for betting on or against their own teams.\n \n\n   \n  Conspirators, it would seem, wisely targeted low-major schools – Eastern Michigan, New Orleans, North Carolina A&T and Mississippi Valley State are among them – where athletes don’t have profitable name, image and likeness deals at their disposal, nor do athletic departments have a surplus of funds to provide the staffing to continually monitor and educate their athletes.\n \n\n   \n  While the details of those investigations have not yet been released, according to a Sports Illustrated report, among the outsiders alleged to be involved in the game fixing: Shane Hennen and Marves Fairley.\n \n\n   \n  This is not six degrees of separation.\n \n\n   \n  The foxes are already in the henhouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/jack-smith-asks-to-testify-congress","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"17:53:00Z","title":"Jack Smith Asks Congress and Justice Department to Allow Public Testimony","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former special counsel Jack Smith has requested permission from Congress and the Justice Department to testify publicly about his investigations into former President Donald Trump, particularly regarding classified records mishandling and actions related to the 2020 election.

leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees.\n \n\n   \n  Smith says he wants to testify “in open hearings” because of “the many mischaracterizations” around his investigations that led to criminal charges against Donald Trump in 2023 for alleged mishandling classified records and actions related to the 2020 election results.\n \n\n   \n  The letter, obtained by CNN, reflects a bubbling inquiry from Republicans in Congress who have accused Smith of wrongdoing in overseeing the prosecutors’ office. Smith has maintained he followed all court and Justice Department protocols.\n \n\n   \n  Smith’s lawyers on Thursday told the Republican committee leaders, however, that he would need reassurance from the Justice Department that “he will not be punished” for testimony, since some of the facts of his special office investigations are still under seal in court or protected by grand jury secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  Jack Smith’s lawyers are expected to formally seek guidance from the Justice Department regarding possible congressional testimony, but have not done so yet, a source familiar to the plans told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The letter sent Thursday by Smith’s attorneys to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley also said their client needed “access” to the files created during his time as special counsel “to provide full and accurate answers” to their questions.\n \n\n   \n  “Jack Smith certainly has a lot of answering to do, but first, Congress needs to have all the facts at its disposal,” Grassley told CNN in a statement. “Hearings should follow once the investigative foundation has been firmly set, which is why I’m actively working with the DOJ and FBI to collect all relevant records that Mr. Smith had years to become familiar with.”\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jamie Raskin, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, urged his committee leaders to accept Smith’s offer.\n \n\n   \n  “I can think of no reason to deny the American people the opportunity to hear his testimony, under oath and with questioning from Members of both parties, and to let all Americans judge for themselves the integrity of Mr. Smith’s investigations. There is no reason his appearance should be in the shadows of a backroom and subject to the usual tiresome partisan tactics of leak-and-distort,” Raskin said in his own letter Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Potential public hearings would give Smith his biggest opportunity yet to defend the integrity of the two criminal cases he brought against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump’s reelection last year brought a swift end to Smith’s prosecutions, the former special counsel has made few public comments about the matter, though he’s been steadfast in his defense of how the historic criminal cases were handled.\n \n\n   \n  During a recent talk in London, he  said the cases were untainted by politics  and called claims that they were politically motivated “absolutely ludicrous.”\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that politics would play a role in big cases like this, it’s absolutely ludicrous and it’s totally contrary to my experience as a prosecutor,” Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  The letter from Smith follows House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan’s  October 14 demand  for his testimony.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated to include additional reporting.

And one area in particular — a region less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) across — has provided scientists with at least half a dozen remarkably well-preserved dinosaur specimens complete with details of scaly skin, hooves and spikes.\n \n\n   \n  The paleontologist Dr. Paul Sereno and his colleagues dub it “the mummy zone” in a new study that aims to explain why this particular area has given rise to so many amazing finds and define exactly what a dinosaur “mummy” is.\n \n\n   \n  In the early 1900s, a fossil hunter named Charles Sternberg found two specimens of a large duck-billed dinosaur, Edmontosaurus annectens, in the Lance Formation. The skeletons were so pristine that Sternberg, along with H.F. Osborn, a paleontologist at New York’s American Museum of Natural History, could make out what appeared to be large swaths of skin with discernible scales and a fleshy crest that seemed to run along the reptile’s neck.\n \n\n   \n  Sereno, lead study author and a professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago, described the initial discovery as “the greatest dinosaur mummy — until maybe the juvenile that we found” in the year 2000.\n \n\n   \n  Separated by nearly a century, Sereno and his team’s find shared common traits with Sternberg’s: The skeletons were preserved in three-dimensional poses and showed clear evidence of skin and other attributes that don’t usually survive 66 million years in the ground. “Osborn said in 1912 he knew that it wasn’t actual, dehydrated skin, like in Egyptian mummies,” Sereno said. “But what was it?”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever it was, “we actually didn’t know how it was preserved,” he said. “It was a mystery.”\n \n\n   \n  The new research puts that mystery to rest and can help paleontologists find, recognize and analyze future mummy finds for tiny clues into how giant dinosaurs really looked.\n \n\n   \n    A dinosaur death cast in clay\n \n\n   \n  Sereno and his collaborators used CT scanning, 3D imaging, electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy to analyze two Edmontosaurus mummies they discovered in the Lance Formation in 2000 and 2001 — a juvenile and a young adult. “We looked and we looked and we looked, we sampled and we tested, and we didn’t find any” remnants of soft tissue, Sereno said.\n \n\n   \n  What the team found instead was a thin layer of clay, less than one-hundredth of an inch thick, which had formed on top of the animals’ skin. “It’s so real-looking, it’s unbelievable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Whereas Sternberg and Osborn referred to the “impression” of skin in their specimens, Sereno’s paper proposes an alternate term — “rendering” — which he argues is more precise.\n \n\n   \n  The study lays out the conditions that would produce such a rendering. In the Late Cretaceous Period, when Edmontosaurus roamed what is now the American West, the climate cycled between drought and monsoon rains. Drought has been determined to have been the cause of death of the original mummy found by Sternberg and described by Osborn, and of other animals whose fossils were found nearby. Assuming the same is true of the new specimens, the carcasses would have dried in the sun in a week or two.\n \n\n   \n  Then, a flash flood buried the bodies in sediment. The decaying carcasses would have been covered by a film of bacteria, which can electrostatically attract clay found in the surrounding sediment. The wafer-thin coating of clay remained long after the underlying tissues decayed completely, retaining their detailed morphology and forming a perfect clay mask.\n \n\n   \n  “Clay minerals have a way of attracting to and sticking onto biological surfaces, ensuring a molding that can faithfully reproduce the outermost surfaces of a body, such as skin and other soft tissues,” said Dr. Anthony Martin, professor of practice in the department of environmental sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved in the research. “So it makes sense that these clays would have formed such fine portraits of dinosaurs’ scales, spikes and hooves.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Stephanie Drumheller-Horton, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who also was not involved in the study, is an expert in taphonomy, which she described as “the study of everything that happens to an organism from when it dies until when we find it.” She is particularly interested in how these fossils formed.\n \n\n   \n  “Dinosaur mummies have been known for over one hundred years, but there has definitely been more emphasis on describing their skin and less on understanding how they fossilized in the first place,” she said via email. “If we can understand how and why these fossils form, we can better target where to look to potentially find more of them.”\n \n\n   \n    A detailed portrait of a duck-billed dinosaur\n \n\n   \n  Together, the two more recently unearthed mummies allowed Sereno and his team to create a detailed update of what Edmontosaurus probably looked like.\n \n\n   \n  According to their analyses, the dinosaur, which could grow to over 12 meters (40 feet) long, had a fleshy crest along the neck and back and a row of spikes running down the tail. The creature’s skin was thin enough to produce delicate wrinkles over the rib cage and was dotted with small, pebble-like scales.\n \n\n   \n  The clay mask revealed that the animal had hooves, a trait previously preserved only in mammals. That makes it the oldest land animal proven to have hooves and the first known example of a hooved reptile, Sereno said. “Sorry, mammals, you didn’t invent it,” he joked. “Did we suspect it? Yeah, we suspected it had a hoof from the footprints, but seeing it is believing.”\n \n\n   \n  The study was published Thursday in  the journal Science. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/east-wing-white-house-photos-demolition","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"17:41:00-20:00","title":"Photos Show Entirety of East Wing, Including Its Colonnade, Torn Down","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Photos published by the Associated Press show that the entire East Wing and East Colonnade of the White House have been demolished as part of President Donald Trump's ambitious plan to build a world-class new ballroom.

pardons Binance founder Changpeng Zhao \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Allison Morrow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:24 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has pardoned  Binance  founder  Changpeng Zhao , who pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in 2023, the White House said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Trump “exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” The move could open the door for Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange and the host of the Trump family’s crypto firm, to operate in the US again, and generated some concern that Trump was helping a man who had helped his family reap financial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt argued that the Biden administration’s sentencing of Zhao was too harsh — a view the president and his top advisers share after Binance’s monthslong lobbying campaign for a pardon for Zhao, who goes by CZ.\n \n\n   \n  Trump defended his decision on Thursday afternoon, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins he issued the pardon, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, “at the request of a lot of very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me just tell you that he was somebody that, as I was told, I don’t know him, I don’t believe I’ve ever met him, but I’ve been told by, a lot of support, he had a lot of support, and they said that what he did is not even a crime,” Trump said during a roundtable in the White House State Dining Room. “It wasn’t a crime, that he was persecuted by the Biden administration, and so, I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a former crypto skeptic who did a 180 on the alternative financial assets while running for a second term, has pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet.” In launching a multi-faceted crypto empire, the Trump family has also established direct financial links to Binance over the past year.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial — on which their wealth is increasingly dependent — is hosted on Binance. The exchange has also helped popularize World Liberty Financial’s proprietary tokens, the sale of which has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the Trump family.\n \n\n   \n  The Wall Street Journal estimated that World Liberty Financial has added  more than $5 billion  in paper wealth to the Trump family fortune — eclipsing the president’s real estate assets.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, MGX, an Emirati-backed investment firm,  agreed to use  World Liberty’s dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1, for a $2 billion investment in Binance. The deal was a huge win for World Liberty Financial, which effectively received a $2 billion bank deposit. At the time, Binance was actively lobbying for Zhao’s pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Trump did not directly address whether his pardon was related to his family’s crypto interests, but acknowledged, “I pardon a lot of people,” during Thursday’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  Asked at Thursday’s White House press briefing about Democratic criticisms of the pardon as corrupt, Leavitt said the White House has “a very thorough examination of every pardon request that comes to the president’s desk.”\n \n\n   \n  She told reporters that she spoke directly with the White House counsel about the pardon, and that the administration believes Zhao’s case was “overly prosecuted” under the Biden administration, which she claimed was “very hostile to the cryptocurrency industry.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison in May 2024 after  pleading guilty  to charges that he failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance, the crypto exchange he founded in 2017, and agreed to pay $200 million in fines. The company agreed to pay more than $4 billion in fines and other penalties as part of a  coordinated settlement  with the federal government in 2023. Binance admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering activities, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao isn’t the only crypto mogul to win a reprieve from Trump since his return to the White House. Shortly after returning to office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, a cause celebre of the Libertarian crypto world, who had been serving a life sentence for creating the Silk Road marketplace, which the Justice Department had described as “the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today.”\n \n\n   \n  Justin Sun, the Chinese crypto billionaire who poured tens of millions of dollars into World Liberty Financial soon after it launched, had been facing civil fraud charges in the United States under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission  dropped the case against Sun  in February. And, in March, Trump  pardoned three co-founders of BitMEX , a crypto exchange, who had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering programs.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/east-wing-white-house-satellite-photos-invs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:46:00Z","title":"White House East Wing Demolished as New Ballroom Project Advances","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Satellite images reveal that the entire East Wing of the White House has been demolished as part of President Donald Trump’s plan to build a new ballroom.

Russian ‘war ATM,’ but the real test is enforcement \n       \n  Analysis by Clare Sebastian, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:08 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After nine months of attempting to coax Russia into concessions using only incentives – whether by holding talks on repairing diplomatic relations or hosting a major bilateral summit on US soil – the Trump administration in an unexpected reversal announced “ massive sanctions ” Wednesday on Moscow’s two biggest oil producers.\n \n\n   \n  Just one week earlier, President Donald Trump had backed away from supplying long-range  Tomahawk missiles  to Ukraine after a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who secured an invitation to a second bilateral summit, this time in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among the more hawkish members of Trump’s Cabinet regarding  Ukraine , was tasked with preparing that summit. But Russia’s uncompromising insistence on addressing what it sees as the “root causes” of the conflict finally hit home at the White House. Trump didn’t want to “waste time” at another summit, he said Wednesday, though he left the door open, suggesting that “we’ll do it in the future.”\n \n\n   \n    Will this dent Russia’s war machine?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s frustration with Russia had clearly been growing in recent months, as it became clear that his much-touted Alaska summit had failed to stop escalating violence in Ukraine. He even shifted his position on Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia, increasing intelligence sharing to help Kyiv target military and energy facilities,  sources told CNN  last week.\n \n\n   \n  And yet after multiple threats from Trump to ramp up sanctions against Moscow failed to materialize, and with the call between the two presidents last week suggesting the US leader was still susceptible to Russian persuasion, Wednesday’s move to sanction the Russian oil giants and their subsidiaries blindsided experts.\n \n\n   \n  “It was actually surprising simply because there was always a discrepancy between Trump’s rhetoric and actions,” said Maria Shagina, a senior fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), in written comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems that today Russia has overplayed its hand, and Trump’s patience is wearing thin,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  How painful this will be for Russia is something that experts and energy markets are still trying to decipher.\n \n\n   \n    What exactly are the sanctions?\n \n\n   \n  This is the first time Trump has imposed direct sanctions on Russia since he returned to office in January, though in August, his administration declared punishing secondary tariffs on India for its purchases of Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions are typical in the sense that the companies listed – Rosneft and Lukoil, along with dozens of subsidiaries – will have their assets frozen in the United States, and US entities will be banned from doing business with them. Yet most experts agree that targeting Rosneft and Lukoil represents a significant change. Together, the two companies account for about half of Russian oil exports, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the Biden administration went after Russia’s third- and fourth-largest oil companies, Gazpromneft and Surgutneftegaz, in its final package of sanctions. But it left the biggest ones alone, experts say, over fears of triggering global supply disruptions that would lead to higher oil prices.\n \n\n   \n  In a note Wednesday night, Helima Croft, head of Commodities Strategy at RBC, called Trump’s sanctions “the most material move to date by the United States to shutter the Russian war ATM.”\n \n\n   \n    What else is the West doing?\n \n\n   \n  Another first for Trump’s second term here is the appearance (whether by accident or design) of coordinating sanctions with NATO allies, which had been normal practice under the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, on October 15, the United Kingdom expanded its sanctions to include Rosneft and Lukoil, and on Wednesday, the European Union also unanimously approved its 19th package of sanctions. That package includes a full transaction ban on Rosneft. And while it stops short of targeting Lukoil, it goes after Litasco, a trading unit of Lukoil in the United Arab Emirates that the European Union describes as “Lukoil’s prominent shadow fleet enabler.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor,” wrote European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who also held a call Wednesday with the US treasury secretary.\n \n\n   \n    How big a blow is this to Russia?\n \n\n   \n  The impact that the new US sanctions could have on the Russian economy is up for debate. Shagina, the IISS senior fellow, points out that the move comes at a “vulnerable point” for Moscow, which faces the double whammy of Western sanctions and what she calls Ukrainian “physical sanctions” with its ongoing drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. Those attacks have already contributed to a 20% drop in Russia’s energy revenues so far this year, though Moscow is planning to make up some of the shortfall through tax increases.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a strong signal, but it’s still more of a signal than a huge blow to the Russian economy,” said Janis Kluge of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank in Berlin. He points out there has been little to no effect so far on the ruble and that the stocks of Lukoil and Rosneft have fallen but “not cratered.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts largely expect that while there may be temporary supply disruptions, Russia will find ways to keep its oil – including that produced by Lukoil and Rosneft – flowing onto global markets.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has set up a total off-grid infrastructure to be able to keep on supplying its oil to its trading partners, especially in India, especially in China,” said Ajay Parmar, director of oil markets and energy transition at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), a London-based commodities data and analytics firm. He said he believes that the Russians will simply make “adjustments” and create new workarounds.\n \n\n   \n  The lasting impact will depend on the US appetite to tackle those workarounds as they arise, said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitical analysis at Energy Aspects, a data and intelligence firm in London\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not clear yet that the Trump administration, even if it doesn’t get what it wants from Putin, is going to have the resolve and the desire to go down that road,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Will this dent the global economy?\n \n\n   \n  The big question for both Russia and the global economy, experts say, is how India will respond to these new US sanctions. Citing industry sources, Reuters reported Thursday that Reliance Industries, India’s biggest importer of Russian crude oil, is planning to cut back or stop imports completely, going even further than the letter of the sanctions as US pressure mounts on New Delhi to stop importing Russian oil as a condition for tariff reduction.\n \n\n   \n  For Russia, this would be critical.  India imports 1.5 million to 2 million barrels of Russian crude per day, Parmar estimates, accounting for about 30-40% of all Russian exports.  If those imports were to suddenly stop, “that would leave only China as the big buyer of Russian oil,” he told CNN. “I think it’s unlikely that China would buy all of that lost oil, so some of it may be taken off the market, and that is really the bigger driver for higher oil prices right now,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  US crude oil prices are down almost 25 percent from their peak in January, a drop that gave Trump “more room now to impose sanctions,” Kluge pointed out. But the challenge will be avoiding sustained price rises that could hand an unexpected windfall to Moscow and partially offset the impact of sanctions, he said. That would likely mean Trump putting further pressure on OPEC+ to boost oil production, said Parmar. If Trump is successful, price rises could be contained.\n \n\n   \n    Will it bring Putin back to the table?\n \n\n   \n  On their own, these sanctions are nowhere near enough to spark a course correction in Moscow, experts agree. And yet they could signal more difficult times ahead for the Kremlin.\n \n\n   \n  The response from Putin, coming almost 24 hours after the US sanctions announcement, was somewhat contradictory.\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions “will not significantly affect our economic well-being,” he told a group of Russian reporters. “No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever make decisions under pressure,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The ultimate economic impact of these new sanctions on Russia is yet to be determined but the political shift is alarming for Moscow, said Kluge, of the German think tank.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, it could be different tomorrow again,” he said referring to Trump’s approach to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  But “it’s a signal that the previous mode of dealing with Russia in which there was always another chance … another extension to the ultimatum … has actually ended.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/jd-vance-israel-gaza-ceasefire-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:16:00-04:00","title":"Rebuilding Rafah Could Happen in 2 to 3 Years, Vance Says as He Leaves Israel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance, during his visit to Israel, expressed optimism about rebuilding Rafah in southern Gaza within two to three years, emphasizing a potential 'Hamas-free zone' for Palestinian return.

2 to 3 years, Vance says as he leaves Israel \n       \n  By Aileen Graef, Oren Liebermann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:16 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President  JD Vance left Israel on Thursday  with an optimistic note, saying Rafah, a city in the southern Gaza strip, could be rebuilt in two to three years.\n \n\n   \n  Vance said Palestinians should be able to move into a “Hamas free zone” in southern Gaza “in the next couple of months.”\n \n\n   \n  He told reporters in Tel Aviv before he boarded Air Force Two that the hope is for people to be able to move back to Rafah. Vance said the reconstruction effort could start “very quickly” in areas not under Hamas control.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re going to have first some people, and then more, and then hopefully in a couple years, a half a million people living in security, living in comfort, and also living in a situation where they’re not threatening their Israeli neighbors,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  It is the first time the US administration has spoken in detail about the potential timeline for the  reconstruction of Gaza , which has been devastated in two years of war.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s visit this week to the region was meant, at least in part, to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to the US-negotiated deal as some Trump administration officials worry he could work to thwart it,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Vance told reporters Thursday that, so far, both Israel and Hamas are respecting the ceasefire with “exceptions.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are little exceptions to break out here and there that would be expected when these two parties have been at war for two years. But so far, the ceasefire is actually holding. The peace is actually holding,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance said he felt “pretty good” about maintaining the fragile peace but did admit there was potential for “little breakouts of violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look, if this peace sticks, you’re going to have these little breakouts of violence. Our message to the Israelis has been: ‘help us build this peace.’ Obviously, the Israelis have their own interests, but we’re going to keep on trying to work with both them and the Gulf-Arab states to make this peace stick,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance acknowledged the upcoming challenges the ceasefire will face as mediators try to create a mechanism to carry out the disarmament of Hamas. The responsibility will ultimately fall to an international force to be deployed to Gaza, an effort that Vance said will require patience.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hope in the administration is that the International Security Force is going to now take the lead in disarming Hamas,” he said. “That’s going to take some time, and it’s going to depend a lot on the composition of that force.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who landed just hours after Vance flew out, said the ceasefire effort remains a top priority for US President Donald Trump. He said that the efforts to date are “a very important achievement,” but added that “there’s more work to be done and bigger achievements that lie ahead, and so we’re here to work on that.”\n \n\n   \n  “We feel very positive and confident that we’re going to get there, despite substantial obstacles. We’re going to get there,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Vance criticizes Israeli vote on West Bank\n \n\n   \n  The US vice president slammed a pair of preliminary votes in Israel’s parliament designed to advance annexation of the occupied West Bank – territory that the international community considers part of a future Palestinian state. Vance said he had been told the votes were “symbolic” and a “political stunt.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally take some insult to it,” Vance told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  One bill to annex the West Bank passed by a single vote, 25-24, while a more limited bill to annex the settlement of Maale Adumim passed by a much wider margin, 32-9. In both cases, more than half of Israel’s Knesset did not vote. Netanyahu and his Likud party opposed the measure, but it passed in its preliminary reading anyway.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement that the bills “are unlikely to go anywhere” and were intended by the opposition to “sow discord” during Vance’s visit, even though the West Bank annexation bill only passed because of the support of Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition partners.\n \n\n   \n   Annexing all or parts of the West Bank  has been a goal of Israel’s right-wing for years. Many hardliners had celebrated Donald Trump’s presidency as an opportunity to advance that agenda, believing he would provide American support to a measure that would immediately face a massive international backlash. But Vance poured cold water on the idea of applying Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy.”\n \n\n   \n  A broad coalition of Arab and Muslim states, led by Saudi Arabia, blasted the Knesset vote as a “blatant violation of international law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement issued by the Saudi Foreign Ministry, the group said in a sharp rebuke that “Israel’s continued unilateral policies and illegal practices will further undermine international law and morality.” They called on Israel to stop expanding settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, meanwhile, has made the expansion of  the Abraham Accords  one of its top foreign policy goals. The accords saw Israel normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and others, representing Trump’s biggest foreign policy achievement from his first term. The US is now trying to advance normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh has made clear that it would only happen with a viable pathway to Palestinian statehood, something openly dismissed by Israel’s right-wing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told  Time Magazine in an interview published on Thursday  that “Saudi Arabia will lead the way toward the Abraham Accords.” When asked whether he thought the country would join the accords by the end of the year, Trump responded, “Yes, I do. I do.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said at a domestic conference on Thursday, however, “If Saudi Arabia tells us, ‘Normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,’ then friends – no thank you. Keep riding your camels In the desert – and we’ll continue building a technological powerhouse.”\n \n\n   \n  Smotrich has repeatedly made clear that one of his top priorities is annexing the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  In the Time interview, Trump bluntly said he won’t allow it.\n \n\n   \n  “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. It will not happen,” he said. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking about the Israel-Hamas war, Trump also said that Netanyahu “would have just kept going” were it not for his intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “It would have gone on for years. And I stopped him, and everybody came together when I stopped, it was amazing,” said Trump. He said the failed Israeli strike in Doha targeting senior Hamas leaders was one of the key moments that helped bring about the ceasefire “because it was so out of joint that it sort of got everybody to do what they have to do.”\n \n\n   \n   Jennifer Hansler and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/entertainment/kim-kardashian-aneurysm","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-23:59","title":"Kim Kardashian Reveals She Had an Aneurysm in New Season of 'The Kardashians'","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kim Kardashian reveals in a preview of Season 7 of 'The Kardashians' that she recently suffered a 'little aneurysm,' a medical condition where an artery wall weakens and balloons out, as defined by the American Heart Association.

Trump’s challenge: Hurting Putin without harming Americans at the gas pump \n       \n  Analysis by Matt Egan, Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:13 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s sanctions crackdown on Russia risks undermining one of the bright spots in the Trump economy: tame gas prices.\n \n\n   \n  The surprising  decision to punish Russia , the second-biggest crude oil producer on the planet, instantly sent oil prices surging Wednesday. Analysts say pump prices are likely to rise modestly in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge for Trump is how to break the Russian war machine without causing a painful price spike that would exacerbate lingering frustrations about the cost of living among voters.\n \n\n   \n  “The market is reacting with shock today. Many thought Trump would never do this,” Bob McNally, founder and president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, told CNN in a phone interview. “Once the shock wears off, we think prices will settle down. However, it’s a close call. There isn’t a lot of margin for error.”\n \n\n   \n  Record-high gas prices haunted the Biden-Harris administration after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. And high prices across the economy helped propel Trump back to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump is trying to force an end to that deadly war while keeping gas prices low. It’s a risky strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “If Trump does anything that abruptly removes Russian oil exports, we would have an immediate explosion in oil prices,” said McNally, who worked as an energy adviser to former President George W. Bush.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has the advantage of operating from a position of strength when it comes to prices.\n \n\n   \n  Up until the past few days, oil prices were trading near multi-year lows. Gas prices, as measured by AAA, looked destined to break through the psychologically important $3-a-gallon level.\n \n\n   \n  “If you want to send a strong signal to Russia, now is exactly the right time to do it when prices are low,” said Dave Turk, who served as deputy energy secretary under President Joe Biden and is now a distinguished visiting fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n \n\n   \n  This setup gives Trump some breathing room to crank up the pressure on Moscow in a bid to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table.\n \n\n   \n  Trump credits his drill-baby-drill agenda — and it is true that US oil production is at all-time highs. But that world-leading oil output hasn’t changed much since Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  What has changed is willingness from OPEC and Saudi Arabia to pump lots more oil in a bid to regain market share lost to, among others, frackers in Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “The confluence of events has enabled the United States to take a harder line with Russia,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.\n \n\n   \n  But too hard of a line could backfire by driving up the highly visible cost of gasoline, which many Americans view as a proxy for the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “It will be a calibrated effort to hurt Putin while protecting motorists,” said McNally.\n \n\n   \n  GasBuddy’s Patrick De Haan expects gas prices to rise in the coming days, but only modestly from $3.07 a gallon on Thursday to $3.10 to $3.15.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not going to be earth-shattering,” De Haan told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  McNally expects the Trump administration to try to thread the needle by making it harder — but not impossible — to buy Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  If China and others can keep buying Russian barrels, but at a significant discount to world oil prices, it could prevent a shortage that drives up prices for American consumers. But it would also punish Putin by shrinking the oil revenue that funds the Russian war machine.\n \n\n   \n  Will it work?\n \n\n   \n  McNally said the most likely scenario is that Russia keeps oil flowing at a steeper discount to Brent oil prices, but he cautioned there is a real risk that Moscow instead is forced to slash production.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a close call,” McNally said.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes are massive for consumers, the US economy and for the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Polls already indicate voters feel Trump is not doing enough to address affordability. And that’s with low gas prices.\n \n\n   \n  “If you want to remain in power, you’ve got to be laser-focused on affordability,” said Turk, the former Biden official. “That’s a big lesson I took away from the prior four years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/us-mortgage-rates","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-04:00","title":"Mortgage rates fall to lowest level of 2025","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mortgage rates in the U.S. fell to 6.19% for the week ending October 23, 2025, the lowest level in over a year, according to Freddie Mac data.

They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona.  Mehmet Oz , director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz,  during a television appearance  in August.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a  recent radio appearance  that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs  began under the Biden administration .\n \n\n   \n  And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said  Joan Alker , a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.\n \n\n   \n  “What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  The  Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona , a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.\n \n\n   \n  State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”\n \n\n   \n  One person  doing that development  is Michael Burstein, who until recently worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called  Digital Public Works  to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”\n \n\n   \n  The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems,  many of which need updating , which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals  roughly four times what it cost  to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.\n \n\n   \n  That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a  temporary extension , despite a  recent report  from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A  complicated sign-up process  has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also allows counties with  high unemployment rates to be exempted , but states must apply for that exemption.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an app that states can use to prove people are eligible for Medicaid, enrollees would still need to know that app existed and how to use it — neither of which is a given, Alker said. There is also no guarantee they’d have reliable cell service or internet access. As  KFF Health News has reported , millions of Americans live in rural areas without reliable internet.\n \n\n   \n  Private vendors also have been working on such apps, said  Jennifer Wagner , who researches Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Wagner said she has seen several vendors demonstrate products they plan to pitch to states for the work rules. Many are limited in scope, she said, like those in the pilot tests.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody has a magical solution that’ll make sure eligible people don’t lose coverage,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   Correction:  This article was revised to correct Michael Burstein’s professional background.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/illinois-governor-candidate-family-killed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:48:00Z","title":"Four family members of Illinois governor candidate killed in Montana helicopter crash, campaign says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Four family members of Darren Bailey, a Republican candidate for governor of Illinois in 2026, were killed in a helicopter crash in eastern Montana.

\n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A site in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico is providing a rare glimpse into the last days of the dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  Rocks and fossils at the Naashoibito Member site show an ecosystem that was filled with a diverse population of dinosaurs just before they disappeared from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Paleontologists have long debated if the dinosaurs  suddenly went extinct  when a 6.2-mile-wide (10-kilometer-wide) asteroid crashed into Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous Period, or if they were in a gradual decline and living in weakened ecosystems ahead of the catastrophic event.\n \n\n   \n  Answering that question requires finding fossils and dating the surrounding rock to come up with an accurate timeline of the site. But identifying fossils in an area accurately dated to just before the extinction event is rare.\n \n\n   \n  A key site of interest for paleontologists has been the well-studied Hell Creek and Fort Union Formations, located in what is now Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.\n \n\n   \n   Hell Creek  has preserved evidence of multiple species of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, as well as rocks, dated to the end of the Cretaceous Period, or just before the dinosaurs went extinct. But the dinosaur community there completely lacked any long-necked species, causing scientists to wonder if those had already disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Now, new research has dated rocks in the Naashoibito Member to the same time period as the Hell Creek Formation, revealing what kinds of dinosaurs lived in different parts of North America just a few hundred thousand years before going extinct.\n \n\n   \n  Among the dinosaurs that lived in the Naashoibito Member was Alamosaurus, one of the largest long-necked dinosaurs that ever lived, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal  Science .\n \n\n   \n  “What our new research shows is that dinosaurs are not on their way out going into the mass extinction,” lead study author Andrew Flynn, assistant professor in the department of geological sciences at New Mexico State University, said in a statement. “They’re doing great, they’re thriving, and that the asteroid impact seems to knock them out. This counters a long-held idea that there was this long-term decline in dinosaur diversity leading up to the mass extinction making them more prone to extinction.”\n \n\n   \n    Cracking the rock time code\n \n\n   \n  Dinosaur fossils were first found in the San Juan Basin beginning in the mid- to late 1800s.\n \n\n   \n  But dating the rock layers containing the fossils is more complicated, Flynn said. First, the layers need to be exposed so they can be studied, and then the rocks themselves must be dated.\n \n\n   \n  “These factors make dinosaur-bearing rocks from the last 400,000 years of the Cretaceous quite rare,” Flynn said.  “Additionally, it takes years of work to establish the ages of rocks, with multiple lines of evidence needing to be collected, which sometimes discourages people from going to new areas to work.”\n \n\n   \n  The fossil record is not neatly organized, and some chapters are missing.\n \n\n   \n  “Species might have failed to enter the fossil record, they might have been preserved as fossils but not yet discovered, or they might have been discovered but lack essential context, such as precise estimates of geological age,” wrote Dr. Lindsay Zanno, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a  related article  published with the research. Zanno was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  The Naashoibito Member site is problematic because erosion has stripped it of the perfect layers of rock found at other sites in North America, making it difficult to determine when the layers were created, Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  Work at the site to determine a more detailed timeline of dinosaur habitation began in 2011. The team members measured the thickness and location of different rock layers, collected samples for testing and identified all of the spots where fossils were found over the last century and a half.  Sample collection  lasted about three to four years just for Cretaceous rocks, while another four to five were spent on the overlying rock that shows when mammals lived at the site after the dinosaurs went extinct.\n \n\n   \n  One way the team was able to date the rocks was by comparing the samples with Earth’s magnetic field, which periodically changes direction. For instance, right now,  magnetic north  aligns with the direction of north. But sometimes, magnetic north can align with the direction of south. Scientists have a clear understanding of when these reversals have occurred over time. By measuring the direction of the magnetic field when the rock layers were created, researchers can narrow down the time frame.\n \n\n   \n  “The end-Cretaceous mass extinction, fortunately for us, took place during a relatively short period of reversed polarity, which makes it much easier to say what our data correlates to,” Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  The team also used radiometric dating — or measuring the decay of certain elements in rocks to determine their ages — on sand grains from sandstone in the Naashoibito Member.\n \n\n   \n  Their results showed that the dinosaur fossils were from a 380,000-year window leading up to the mass extinction event. The team also determined that mammals appeared about 350,000 years after the mass extinction event.\n \n\n   \n    Regions of diverse dinosaurs\n \n\n   \n  The new study paints a portrait of two very different dinosaur communities divided between the north and south regions of the continent.\n \n\n   \n  Both areas had dinosaurs in common, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Torosaurus. Fossils of duck-billed dinosaurs were also found at each location, but they belonged to different groups. There were no giant, long-necked sauropods to be found in the north, which for a long time led some paleontologists to think that after millions of years of pushing the boundaries of evolution with their humongous sizes, they had gone extinct, said study coauthor Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n  But they flourished in the south, including Alamosaurus, which reached 100 feet (30 meters) long, a height of 30 to 50 feet (9 to 15 meters) and weighed over 30 tons,   Brusatte said. The fact that one of the biggest dinosaurs, and one of the largest animals ever to live on Earth, witnessed an asteroid striking the planet truly illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving to the very end, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I can imagine the scene, one minute a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid,” Brusatte said.\n \n\n   \n  Part of the reason for the differing groups divided between north and south was likely due to climate conditions, Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  The Naashoibito Member site   was like a warm and humid tropical forest, similar to conditions in modern Panama, while the Hell Creek area was at a much lower elevation and included the cooler conditions of an inland sea coastal plain.\n \n\n   \n  “They were doing what dinosaurs had been doing for over 150 million years, adapting to their local conditions, dividing up niches in the food chain, varying in size and shape and diet, exhibiting rich diversity across the landscape,” Brusatte said. “There is no sign that these dinosaurs were in any trouble.”\n \n\n   \n  The new evidence about diverse, late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is exciting, said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the School of Earth Sciences at the UK’s University of Bristol. Benton was not involved in the new study, and his previous research has suggested a decline in dinosaur populations before the asteroid strike.\n \n\n   \n  “However, this is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world,” Benton wrote in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “As the authors also show in the paper, in general dinosaurs of the last 6 million years of the Cretaceous were less diverse, falling from 43 species beforehand to 30 species in western North America. We would suggest that there is evidence for overall declines in dinosaurs towards the end of the Cretaceous, with individual rich faunas where climates were favourable.”\n \n\n   \n  But Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor within the department of Earth, energy, and environment at the University of Calgary, said she﻿ believes the new findings   could   change how researchers think about dinosaurs in North America before the mass extinction event.\n \n\n   \n  Zelenitsky was not involved in the new research, but her team’s ongoing work in Alberta uncovering fossil eggshells linked to diverse dinosaur species aligns with the findings about stable dinosaur populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The research team uncovered compelling new evidence (…) that dinosaurs were still going strong ‘til the very end,” Zelenitsky wrote in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The new study may focus on dinosaurs, but the fact that 75% of species on Earth disappeared at the same time contains a lesson that remains applicable today, Brusatte said.\n \n\n   \n  “Sudden climate and environmental change can catch animals and ecosystems unaware,” he said, “and can defeat even the strongest and most iconic of species.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/media/ellison-wbd-trump-warner-bros-discovery-bid","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:32:00-20:00","title":"David Ellison May Have a ‘Trump Card’ — Literally — in Warner Bros.

Discovery pursuit \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can  sign up for free here . \n \n\n   \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison is “undeterred” after Warner Bros. Discovery rebuffed his first three offers to buy the media giant, according to a person who has been advising Ellison.\n \n\n   \n  The next move is unknown. But both Ellison and Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav are playing their parts perfectly in this M&A struggle over one of the biggest media companies in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of CNN, HBO Max, DC Comics, Cartoon Network, and a storied list of other brands, said earlier this week that it had started a deal review process “after receiving interest from multiple parties.”\n \n\n   \n  The newly formed Paramount Skydance is at the top of the list, as Ellison tries to rapidly grow his media empire.\n \n\n   \n  Ellison’s allies are privately arguing that he is the only buyer who would pass muster with Trump administration regulators. “That’s the Trump card,” an adviser remarked, enjoying the double entendre.\n \n\n   \n  The adviser, like the other sources for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because the companies are not commenting publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Privately, Ellison is exuding the kind of confidence that comes from having tens of billions in cash. His ambitions are bolstered by his father, Larry Ellison, Oracle’s executive chairman, who currently ranks as the second-richest man in the world. Together they are “building an unprecedented media empire,” as The Washington Post put it earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  However, so far, WBD has turned down the Ellison entreaties. Zaslav, who has led WBD since it was formed through a 2022 combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery, is insisting that the company is worth more than the $23.50 per share that Ellison most recently offered.\n \n\n   \n  And the WBD board agrees, having unanimously voted to reject that bid.\n \n\n   \n  Zaslav is talking internally about how HBO Max and the Warner Bros. movie studio would fit well with Amazon or Netflix, according to a person involved in the conversations.\n \n\n   \n  NBCUniversal’s parent company, Comcast, is also taking a look at WBD’s assets, sources told CNN earlier.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s for-sale announcement signaled that many outcomes are possible: A deal for all of WBD, a deal for the company’s streaming and studio assets to another company, or the already-planned split of WBD into two publicly traded halves.\n \n\n   \n  Lest there is any doubt, Ellison does want to buy all the WBD assets, including CNN, even though Warner is newly willing to sell pieces, sources with knowledge of the talks said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellison’s recent acquisition of The Free Press and installation of Bari Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief evinces a deep interest in news — in ways that worry some and excite others.\n \n\n   \n    The Trump factor matters\n \n\n   \n  Paramount’s pursuit of WBD raises big questions about billionaire control of major media conglomerates. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for one, has been raising her voice about potential consumer harms.\n \n\n   \n  And Wall Street analysts have been asserting that President Trump’s personal preferences may weigh heavily on the deal process. The commentary is a stark reminder of how the president has reshaped the government in his own image.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly praised the Ellisons in recent months. “They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” the president said in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  “They will make the right decisions,” Trump added. “They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s praise is notable partly because the younger Ellison was a big Democratic donor as recently as last year. He was spotted schmoozing near Trump at two different UFC matches earlier this year, though, and he agreed to several conditions imposed by the Trump-aligned FCC in order to complete his takeover of Paramount.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the elder Ellison has expressed support for Trump in the past and has been leading a group of investors who intend to buy TikTok’s US assets, potentially giving Trump a political and cultural win.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount is leveraging these presidential relationships as it pursues WBD. “Trump’s implicit support for the deal is their number one talking point,” a person involved in the negotiations said.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount insiders refute that, noting that Ellison made many pro-deal arguments in a letter to WBD’s board that The New York Times obtained on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that we are the best partner for WBD,” Ellison wrote in the letter, “with a combination of our two companies creating a scaled Hollywood champion to the benefit of both our companies’ shareholders, consumers and the entertainment industry at large.”\n \n\n   \n  Some analysts have backed up those arguments. Paramount’s bid “makes a lot of strategic sense by owning a much stronger slate of I.P. at Warner Bros. and seeking scale with the combined HBO Max and Paramount+ platforms,” Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson said in a note to investors.\n \n\n   \n  Fishman also said that “combining the linear network portfolios would also likely yield significant cost synergies, while unlocking strategic benefits from pairing CBS News with CNN and leveraging the long-standing CBS-Turner partnership for NCAA’s March Madness Final Four plus other overlapping sports rights portfolios.”\n \n\n   \n  But Warner’s leaders argue that Paramount is not fully valuing its assets. Plus, though the Trump factor looms large, US regulators are not the only government officials to consider.\n \n\n   \n  A Paramount-WBD deal would face regulatory scrutiny in the United Kingdom, the European Union and some Latin American countries. The perception of Trump clearing the way for the Ellisons in the US could hurt them in other markets, sources said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/climate/florida-coral-reef-heatwave-extinct","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"Critical Florida corals now ‘functionally extinct’ due to off-the-charts ocean temperatures","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major study reveals that elkhorn and staghorn corals — once dominant reef builders in Florida’s ecosystem for over 10,000 years — are now functionally extinct due to an unprecedented marine heatwave in summer 2023, which pushed ocean temperatures to over 90°F, the highest recorded in over 150 years.

due to off-the-charts ocean temperatures \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Elkhorn and staghorn corals used to carpet Florida’s reef system, rising like antlers from the seabed — but not anymore. These  crucial coral species  are now “functionally extinct” in the region after record-breaking   ocean temperatures, according to a study published Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The corals, which have been dominant reef builders in Florida for the past 10,000 years, were already critically endangered due to a host of factors including disease, pollution, hurricanes and ocean warming. But an  unprecedented  marine heat wave may have delivered a fatal blow.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 2023, Florida’s water temperatures peaked at more than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest recorded in the region for at least 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Heat stress is a coral killer. It causes them to eject the algae that provide them with their color and energy, leaving behind a ghostly bleached skeleton. They can recover if temperatures return to normal, but the more intense and prolonged the heat, the more likely it is they will die.\n \n\n   \n  The 2023 heatwave in Florida lasted roughly three months. As the high temperatures persisted, researchers dove beneath the water to closely monitor more than 52,300 Acropora corals, a group that includes staghorn and elkhorn corals. The study area covered all of  Florida’s coral reef system , which stretches nearly 350 miles from the Dry Tortugas and Florida Keys in the southwest to the St. Lucie Inlet on the state’s east coast.\n \n\n   \n  By March 2024, an astonishing 98% to 100% of colonies on the southern end of the system had died, according to the study, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch and Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium.\n \n\n   \n  The heat wave marks the “functional extinction” of the colonies, the report found, a term marking the stage that often precedes the complete disappearance of a species.\n \n\n   \n  While some elkhorn and staghorn corals remain, they are “no longer in densities high enough to carry out their ecological role — in this case, building and maintaining the reef structure,” said Ross Cunning, a research biologist at Shedd Aquarium and a study author.\n \n\n   \n  The surviving remnants of colonies, mainly located toward the north end of the reef system, are also vulnerable to disease, predators and storm damage.\n \n\n   \n  The loss of these corals sets off “cascading impacts,” Cunning told CNN. “Reef growth slows, habitat complexity declines, and fish and invertebrates lose shelter and resources they depend on,” he said. It also leaves coastlines more exposed to storms and erosion.\n \n\n   \n  The report’s findings are “a stark warning for the future of coral reefs worldwide,” the authors wrote in a statement accompanying their research.\n \n\n   \n  A recent study from the University of Exeter found the planet’s warm water coral reefs have already been pushed  passed a tipping point  by climate change, and   reefs on any meaningful scale will be lost   unless global warming is reversed.\n \n\n   \n  In Florida, natural recovery of Acropora corals is unlikely, the new report concludes. Climate projections suggest severe bleaching will occur every year by 2040 and, as oceans continue to warm, other coral species are likely to die off, too. “True global extinctions” of multiple coral species could happen in the coming decades for the whole Caribbean region, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have tried to  artificially bolster  Florida’s coral populations by rearing colonies in nurseries both onshore and offshore, but the   success of these efforts will depend on the frequency and severity of future bleaching events, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings are “extremely significant” and drive home the importance of immediate action to cut planet-heating pollution, said Keri O’Neil, director and senior scientist of the Coral Conservation Program at the Florida Aquarium, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  But functional extinction does not mean the species will go completely extinct, she added. “Human intervention, combined with improved ocean conditions, can reverse this trend.”\n \n\n   \n  Cunning said the report should not be interpreted as “a message of hopelessness” but instead as a call to action. “The window to prevent further losses is rapidly closing, yet targeted interventions and aggressive climate action can still make the difference.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/house-democrats-probe-trump-230-million-doj-payment","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-04:00","title":"House Democrats Launch Probe into Trump’s Potential $230M Payment from His Own Justice Department","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Democrats, led by Reps.

probe into Trump’s potential $230M payment from his own Justice Department \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:41 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia are launching an investigation into President Donald Trump’s reported demand that  his own Justice Department hand over $230 million  as compensation for past federal investigations into him, according to a letter obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s ask, made through administrative claims filed in 2023 and 2024, resurfaced in recent days after  The New York Times  reported on the matter and Trump confirmed publicly he “could be” seeking such a payment.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrats on the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees are asking Trump to hand over a slew of documents, including the administrative claims filed by his legal representatives, his communications with his attorneys and government officials on the matter and all DOJ memoranda outlining the legal merits of the claims. Without a subpoena to compel the release of the information, however, it remains unlikely the Democrats’ request will gain much traction.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, the Democrats argue, could have brought his claims to court much earlier. They say that the president is only pursuing this now because he has installed his own personal lawyers within the Department of Justice. It was not immediately clear what steps Trump or his legal team had taken in recent days or weeks to press the claims.\n \n\n   \n  “If either of your claims had any merit, you could have taken them to court by now and litigated them publicly,” Raskin and Garcia wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “You did not do that. Instead, you waited until you became President and installed your handpicked loyalists at DOJ, knowing that you could instruct them to co-sign your demand notes in secret behind closed doors, and then you could present the notes to the U.S. Treasury for cold hard cash courtesy of the American taxpayer. That isn’t justice, it is theft,” they continued.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the Times report, House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN on Thursday that he hasn’t “had time to get the details” and that “it’s still on my list of things to-do.”\n \n\n   \n  However, at least one Republican – Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina – has conceded the president is in a “difficult position” and that the request is “terrible optics.”\n \n\n   \n  “Particularly right now, we’re talking about a quarter of a billion dollars transferring, maybe to the president when we’re in a shutdown posture, so it’s at very best bad timing, but I think it’s horrible optics,” Tillis said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Trump said he “could be” seeking the money, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be,” Trump said from the Oval Office when asked about the Times report.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The president at the time acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself” damages to resolve claims that the Justice Department under his predecessor had wronged him.\n \n\n   \n  “With the country, it’s interesting, because I’m the one that makes the decision,” Trump said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A settlement to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/king-charles-state-visit-vatican-pope-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-04:00","title":"King Charles Prays with Pope Leo at the Vatican as Prince Andrew Scandal Looms Back Home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a state visit to the Vatican, King Charles III became the first British monarch to pray publicly with Pope Leo XIV in over 500 years, marking a historic ecumenical moment.

It was presided over by Leo and the Church of England’s Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell.\n \n\n   \n  A joint choir from St. George’s Chapel and the Chapel Royal performed at the service, alongside the choir of the Sistine Chapel. The British singers performed “If ye love me,” by Thomas Tallis, a prolific composer of sacred choral works from the Renaissance period\n \n\n   \n  The choice was significant because Tallis’ life spanned the split from Rome precipitated by King Henry VIII. Tallis continued to have a successful career after the Reformation, despite never renouncing his Catholic faith.\n \n\n   \n  The sight of the first joint prayer shared by the King and Pope signals the deepening of bonds between Catholics and Anglicans – a theme of the whistlestop visit.\n \n\n   \n  The King and Queen earlier met the new pontiff for the first time since his May election on Thursday morning, following their arrival in Rome the previous evening to celebrate the holy Jubilee year, which takes place every quarter of a century. They also met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See Secretary of State.\n \n\n   \n  The British monarch gifted the Pope with a large silver photograph, and Icon of St Edward the Confessor, according to Buckingham Palace. In exchange, Leo presented with a scale version of the mosaic of “Christ Pantocrator,” in the Norman Cathedral of Cefalù, in Sicily.\n \n\n   \n  The Vatican described the discussions as “cordial” and “matters of common interest were discussed, such as environmental protection and the fight against poverty.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement added, “Particular attention was given to the shared commitment to promoting peace and security in the face of global challenges.”\n \n\n   \n  The trip is being seen by both sides as a “significant moment” in reconciling divisions between the British monarchy and the papacy that go back to 1534, when Henry VIII broke with Rome and created the Church of England.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be difficult to overstate the significance of this particular visit,” Rev. Martin Browne, a Vatican official who works at the department for “Promoting Christian Unity,” told CNN. He said it was the first time that a royal visit had an “ecumenical dimension,” meaning that it was focused on building unity between Rome, the Church of England and wider Anglican communion.\n \n\n   \n  “A service in which both the pope and a British sovereign participate has not been experienced since long before the Reformation,” Browne explained. “Its uniqueness is underlined by the fact that it is taking place in the Sistine Chapel, inside the Apostolic Palace, with the music being led by the pope’s ‘own’ choir and two of the King’s ‘own’ choirs.”\n \n\n   \n  Later, the King and Queen took part in an ecumenical service at the Basilica of St. Paul’s Outside the Walls, which has historic ties to the English Crown and is home to the tomb of the apostle St. Paul, for which past British monarchs paid the upkeep. It is one of the four papal basilicas in Rome and also houses a community of Benedictine monks.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo has approved making King Charles a “Royal Confrater” of St. Paul’s, as a “gesture of hospitality and spiritual fellowship.” In celebration of this new bond, a special throne-like chair has been commissioned by the place of worship, featuring the King’s coat of arms and the Latin motto “Ut unum sint” (“That they may be one”). It will remain permanently in the basilica for use by his successors.\n \n\n   \n  The pope is also making the King and Queen a knight and dame of the order of Pius IX. Charles has himself decided to honor Pope Leo by making him a “Papal Confrater of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle” and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, an honor traditionally given to heads of state.\n \n\n   \n  The state visit concluded with King Charles attending a reception at the Pontifical Beda College, a seminary which trains priests from across the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, Queen Camilla met six Catholic sisters from the International Union of Superiors General, who work to support female empowerment around the world, including through girls’ education.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the turbulence of the past, relations between the Vatican and the British monarchy are today marked by warmth and mutual respect. The UK and the Holy See have had full diplomatic relations since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Charles and Camilla were supposed to pay a state visit to the Vatican in early April, but the trip was postponed over Pope Francis’ poor health. They continued with an official visit to Italy, visiting Rome and Ravenna in the northeast. But the royal couple were able to privately visit the ailing pontiff a fortnight before he died.\n \n\n   \n  As Prince of Wales, Charles visited Vatican City on five occasions, while his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, met five popes during her lifetime.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, there are differences and divisions, some of them very deep,” Browne said. “But this (visit) is a reminder for everyone that what unites is more significant.”\n \n\n   \n  Diarmaid MacCulloch, a church historian from the University of Oxford, said that while there had been some ill-informed “hype” around the King’s visit, “there is some genuine significance in the Papacy showing such formal favor” to Charles.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a nice goodwill gesture on the Vatican’s part, and goodwill gestures are always welcome,” MacCulloch said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-updates-teen-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:32:00-04:00","title":"Microsoft AI CEO: We’re making an AI that you can trust your kids to use","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman is advocating for a safe, trustworthy AI experience by emphasizing that Copilot should not engage in romantic or erotic content, even for adults, and should instead promote real human connections.

 \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Popular artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT and Meta AI are increasingly blurring the line between real-world and digital relationships by allowing romantic and sometimes sexual conversations — while  scrambling  to make sure children aren’t accessing that adult content.\n \n\n   \n  But Microsoft wants no part of that, the company’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “We are creating AIs that are emotionally intelligent, that are kind and supportive, but that are fundamentally trustworthy,” Suleyman said. “I want to make an AI that you trust your kids to use, and that means it needs to be boundaried and safe.”\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft is locked in a race with tech giants like OpenAI, Meta and Google to make its Copilot the AI tool of choice in what Silicon Valley believes will be the next big computing wave. Copilot now has 100 million monthly active users across Microsoft’s platforms, the company said in its most recent earnings call. That’s well below competitors like OpenAI, whose  ChatGPT has 800 million  monthly active users.\n \n\n   \n  But Microsoft is betting its approach will win it a wider audience, especially as AI companies grapple with how to shape their chatbot’s personalities amid reports of AI  contributing to users’ mental health crises .\n \n\n   \n  “We must build AI for people; not to be a digital person,” Suleyman wrote in a blog post earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The interview came ahead of a series of  new Copilot features  that Microsoft unveiled on Thursday, which include the ability to refer back to previous chats, engage in group conversations, improved responses to health questions and an optional, sassy tone called “real talk.”\n \n\n   \n    Saying no to erotica\n \n\n   \n  Some of Microsoft’s AI competitors are facing intense pressure to keep young users safe on their platforms.\n \n\n   \n  Families have sued  OpenAI  and  Character.AI  claiming their chatbots harmed their children, in some cases allegedly contributing to their suicides. A string of  reports  earlier this year raised concerns that Meta’s chatbot and other AI characters would engage in sexual conversations even with accounts identifying as minors.\n \n\n   \n  The tech companies behind popular AI chatbots say they’ve rolled out new protections for kids, including content restrictions and parental controls. Meta and OpenAI are also implementing AI age estimation technology aiming to catch young users who sign up with fake, adult birthdates — but it’s unclear how well those systems work. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  announced  earlier this month that with its new safety precautions in place, ChatGPT will soon let adult users discuss “erotica” with the chatbot.\n \n\n   \n  Suleyman said Microsoft is drawing a bright line at romantic, flirtatious and erotic content, even for adults. “That’s just not something that we will pursue,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  That means, for now, Microsoft is unlikely to roll out a “young user” mode like some of its competitors — because they shouldn’t need it, Suleyman said.\n \n\n   \n    Prioritizing human connection\n \n\n   \n  A key focus for Microsoft is training Copilot to encourage users to interact with other humans, not just AI. That’s key for a company that has built its business around providing work-oriented productivity tools.\n \n\n   \n  Its new “groups” feature will let up to 32 people — think, classmates working on an assignment or friends planning a trip — join a shared chat with Copilot, where the chatbot can chime in with suggestions.\n \n\n   \n  That theme of pointing users to real people applies to Copilot’s health updates, too. The chatbot will recommend nearby doctors for certain medical-related queries, and will otherwise draw on “medically trusted” sources such as Harvard Health.\n \n\n   \n  Suleyman said he believes this push to get Microsoft’s AI chatbot to help strengthen human-to-human relationships “is a very significant tonal shift to other things that are happening in the industry at the moment, which are starting to see these things as deep simulations where you can go off into your own world and have an entire parallel reality, including, in some cases, adult content.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/us-cpi-september-inflation-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00.000Z","title":"A tiny light in an economic data blackout is about to shine through the shutdown for a brief moment","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown that has blocked most economic data reporting, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Friday, marking a rare data point in a blackout.

    12:41 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nearly two dozen days have passed since a federal agency  has published an economic report . The US government’s shutdown has resulted in a blackout of critical data,  further clouding  an already opaque economic outlook.\n \n\n   \n  That will change – albeit briefly – Friday morning, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release the Consumer Price Index report for September.\n \n\n   \n  The September CPI will allow the data-hungry to get a little fix, providing a snapshot of how prices are trending for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  The report is a one-off of sorts:  BLS staff were called back into the office  this month   to allow the government to meet statutory requirements in adjusting Social Security payments for next year. The September CPI is the final piece of data needed for the 2026 cost of living adjustment.\n \n\n   \n  So, after the CPI is released, darkness once again will envelop federal economic data until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  (And as for the report itself, economists tell CNN that despite the circumstances behind the delayed release, they’re not concerned about the integrity of the underlying data.)\n \n\n   \n    Expect inflation to move back above 3%\n \n\n   \n  Economists expect the latest data to show   that prices for a slew of commonly purchased goods and services rose at a faster-than-typical clip (0.4%) last month. This would lift the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3.1% – the fastest pace in more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  There are many factors behind the upswing, including: pricier gas, food and tariff-impacted goods as well as slower-than-anticipated reduction in inflation on the services side – notably housing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s helpful to remember that the last time inflation was below 2% was in February 2021, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview.\n \n\n   \n  “At the macro level, it’s a reminder of how sticky inflation can be when it gets out of the tube and how hard it is to get to back to that 2% once it’s been above target for a while,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The foods likely to get pricier\n \n\n   \n  American consumers have weathered nearly five years of prices rising faster than they typically should (and prices rose far, far faster than usual for two of those years). However, years of high inflation have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  Food prices, for example, have risen 24% between 2020 and 2024, noted Billy Roberts, senior analyst for food and beverage at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses and rural firms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen smaller degrees of inflation, even over the course of this year, but it’s really that cumulative effect,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In August,  grocery prices jumped 0.6% , the highest monthly increase in nearly three years, according to BLS data. Economists expect the September gain to be more mellow; however, certain categories likely will highlight pain points.\n \n\n   \n  Beef prices, for example,  have risen dramatically  in recent years as herds have shrunk amid  prolonged drought .  Cocoa  and  coffee prices , which have been pushed higher by  climate change  stifling supply, now  face further pressures from tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  Consumers stocking up for trick-or-treaters are now seeing the effects, Roberts said, noting cocoa prices are “still about double, if not triple, what they were in 2022-’23.”\n \n\n   \n  “Those aren’t items that consumers necessarily buy week in and week out,” but they’re buying in bulk now for Halloween, he said. “Those prices are going to provide a lot of sticker shock for consumers.”\n \n\n   \n    The K-shaped economy fallout\n \n\n   \n  Food prices remain a sore spot for many Americans  as do electricity prices , which also have been on the rise, Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those categories, Brusuelas noted he’ll be monitoring services-related inflation — such as airfare and other discretionary areas — and whether it’s remaining stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “What I am concerned about is the sticky and stubborn service sector costs along with rising food and utility prices, which are really placing stress on middle-class and down-market households,” he said. “And this is a function of that greater discussion around the K-shaped economy, where 40% of this country is thriving.”\n \n\n   \n  A recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics found that the country’s top-earners (who have benefited from a surging stock market, rising wages and increased housing wealth)  are accounting for an even greater share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  “Down market,” Brusuelas added, “it’s a very different reality.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/chess-vladimir-kramnik-daniel-naroditsky-fide-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:32:00-04:00","title":"Former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik Investigated for Bullying Following Death of Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is under investigation by FIDE for bullying and harassment after the unexpected death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who had been publicly accused of cheating in online games.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former world  chess  champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment following the death of fellow player  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator.

But this week he said his aim wasn’t to increase his planet-leading wealth. Instead, Musk said the biggest pay package in history was necessary to protect his company.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk said on a call with investors Wednesday. “There needs to be enough voting control to give (me) a strong influence – but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.”\n \n\n   \n  Musk said he needs to protect Tesla from two influential (but hardly all-powerful) research firms that advise shareholders how to vote – ISS and Glass Lewis, which he described as “corporate terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and …then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” he said. “They have made many terrible recommendations in the past that if those recommendations had been followed, it would have been extremely destructive to the future of the company.”\n \n\n   \n  Musk claimed that passive index funds that control much of Tesla’s shares blindly follow the recommendations of ISS and Glass Lewis. But shareholder votes have always followed Tesla’s board recommendations. Although shareholders have voted against other companies’ board recommendations, they’re quite rare.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Glass Lewis and ISS recommended votes against a previous massive pay package for Musk. But shareholders approved that package in 2018 with 73% of shares held by investors other than Musk and his brother. After a Delaware judge threw out that pay package ruling it wasn’t in the interest of shareholders, Tesla held another vote and that time it was approved by holders of 84% of the shares.\n \n\n   \n  The two firms have reportedly recommended a vote against Musk’s newest pay package as well.

It’s a new, troubling tendency for Atlantic storms \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:45 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Tropical Storm Melissa  is expected to meander the Caribbean at an agonizingly slow pace in the coming days, even as it’s forecast to strengthen into a hurricane, covering as little as 2 miles in an hour. This is slower than an average person’s walking speed.\n \n\n   \n  Hurricanes are powerful storms, but they require a tug or pull from other weather systems, such as a cold front or a dip in the jet stream, to determine how fast they move and where they go.\n \n\n   \n  When those influences are very weak or absent, however — as is the case with Melissa — a storm can meander for days, dumping torrential amounts of rainfall on anyone unlucky enough to be nearby.\n \n\n   \n  Slow movement and weak upper-level winds can also help a storm like Melissa intensify into a major hurricane — Category 3 or stronger. Right now, the Caribbean Sea has some of the most unusually hot waters of any part of the Atlantic Ocean, and the storm could have the opportunity to tap into that energy.\n \n\n   \n  “The potential intensity is quite elevated in the Caribbean, compared to the 1979-2023 average for this time of year,” said Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist specializing in tropical cyclones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There has not been much storm activity in the Caribbean so far this year due to strong upper-level winds that have inhibited nascent storms from intensifying, he pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  But now, conditions are expected to be primed for Tropical Storm Melissa to keep at its snail’s pace.\n \n\n   \n    Are hurricanes slowing down?\n \n\n   \n  There is evidence that slow-moving tropical storms and hurricanes are occurring more frequently in the Atlantic Basin, particularly near and over land masses, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  Studies in the past several years have showed a slow-down in forward speed at landfall. That’s a critical change, since a slower-moving storm typically means more flooding rainfall, and potentially more storm surge.\n \n\n   \n  Some research has pointed to global warming as a potential cause of this trend, but this is not yet fully established, said meteorologist Kieran Bhatia of the global risk and reinsurance company Guy Carpenter.\n \n\n   \n  Some studies, Bhatia said, show tropical storms and hurricanes have slowed down in recent years over the continental United States and near-coastal US   regions as well.\n \n\n   \n  However, “these observed changes have not yet been confidently linked” to human-caused climate change, he said. The most recent major report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found a trend that is not explainable solely by natural variability with “medium” confidence, Bhatia said.\n \n\n   \n  Research from hurricane expert James Kossin and his colleagues have in fact pointed to  global slowdowns in tropical cyclone forward speeds . They found this trend was related to changes in upper-level air circulation that are consistent with expectations from global warming.\n \n\n   \n  Other work from Kossin, a former scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who teaches at the University of Wisconsin, stands out for showing a trend toward slower-moving or even stalling North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes  at or near landfall .\n \n\n   \n   Additional research by other scientists  provides further evidence of recent slowdowns in the forward movement of tropical cyclones, while some  modeling studies project  that future climate change is likely to result in more meandering storms.\n \n\n   \n  But the broader community of meteorologists and climate scientists are not yet fully in agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of any climate change ties, any tendency to slow down, like the crawling forward speed of Tropical Storm Melissa, has huge implications for impacts because it allows such storms to dump heavier rainfall totals over land.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa, for example, poses a major flooding threat to Jamaica and Hispaniola in particular, due to its extended proximity to land, the presence of tall mountains that tend to wring out moisture from the atmosphere and the likelihood that heavy rains will fall for many consecutive days.\n \n\n   \n  While the tie between slower-moving storms and climate change is a topic of active research, studies have conclusively shown tropical storms and hurricanes now produce more rainfall than they used to. This is due to warming ocean and air temperatures, since warmer air holds more moisture.\n \n\n   \n  A devastating example of a slow-moving, water-laden storm was Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which produced 60.58 inches of rain in southeastern Texas. This was the highest rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in US history.\n \n\n   \n  As storms slow down, there is potential for more hurricanes to be like Harvey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/baseball-mlb-seattle-mariners-defeat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"It’s a failure: Seattle Mariners feel the deep pain of disappointment after narrowly missing out on first World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Seattle Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series in their 49-year history, narrowly missed their first appearance in the Fall Classic after losing to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the ALCS.

 Seattle Mariners , the wait goes on.\n \n\n   \n  One game away from reaching a first World Series in franchise history, Seattle fell heartbreakingly short in Monday’s 4-3  defeat  against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n \n\n   \n  The gut-wrenching loss ensures that the Mariners’ unwanted record as the only team in Major League Baseball never to appear at the Fall Classic remains very much intact.\n \n\n   \n  To see how much this moment pained Seattle and its players, look no further than MVP candidate  Cal Raleigh , who was reduced to tears at the end of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I love every guy in this room, but ultimately, it’s not what we wanted,” Raleigh told reporters after the game. “I hate to use the word failure, but it’s a failure.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what we expected: to get to the World Series and win a World Series. That’s what the bar is and the standard is – that’s what we want to hold ourselves accountable to – but it hurts.”\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh was far from alone in his pain. “We’ve put in so much work and effort through this whole year and it’s over,” said Seattle center fielder Julio Rodríguez. “That’s also part of the game too.”\n \n\n   \n  The disappointment is also felt strongly among the team’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “As someone who’s a Seattle transplant, I don’t quite have the decades of embedded angst that some locals may carry with them,” Mariners fan Gabe Guarente, 48, told  CNN Sports . “But I do sort of share their fatalistic view of the team. We don’t really expect good things to happen, so when they do, it’s more of a pleasant surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s why this year’s ALCS Game 7 loss felt both inevitable and completely heartbreaking at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  Guarente described his emotions after the defeat as “gloomy … with an undercurrent of simmering rage at the cruel baseball gods.”\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions during this year’s American League Championship Series (ALCS), the signs looked so promising for the Mariners. They jumped into a 2-0 series lead, then went 3-2 up after victory in Game 5.\n \n\n   \n  And in the winner-takes-all game at Toronto’s Rodgers Centre, Seattle went 3-1 ahead when Raleigh launched his fifth home run of the postseason and fourth against the Blue Jays, putting his team in control of the contest at the top of the fifth.\n \n\n   \n  That, however, would be the high point of a miserable night for the Mariners. George Springer’s three-run homer saw Toronto move ahead in the seventh inning, and with that, Seattle’s hopes evaporated.\n \n\n   \n  Having never in their 49-season history been so close to appearing at the World Series, right now, it might feel like the Mariners have never been further away.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a lot of anger and some tears from my friends and other fans afterward,” Mariners supporter Joseph Leavitt, 30, told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  In time, fans will be able to reflect on the team’s successful year, reaching a first ALCS since 2001 with a thrilling, near-five-hour win over the Detroit Tigers.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-year-old Raleigh has been the heartbeat of this Seattle team, hitting an MLB-leading 60 home runs in the regular season, only the seventh player in history to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  He signed a reported six-year, $105 million contract extension back in March, while Rodríguez is also locked into a long-term contract through 2029.\n \n\n   \n  For the Mariners – just the fourth team to lead a best-of-seven series 2-0 in the postseason and not advance – the ambition of reaching a first-ever World Series is still there, even in the post-mortem of a brutal loss.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us now have had a taste of how close we can get and how good this team can be,” said manager Dan Wilson. “Once you get that, that’s what you’re shooting for the next year and I know that will continue to be the goal … to get to that final step.\n \n\n   \n  “This year, we were one game short.”\n \n\n   \n  Fans like Guarente are cautiously optimistic about the future, given the talent and age profile of the Seattle team.\n \n\n   \n  “If they invest even a little bit in free agency, I think they can get back in this position,” he said. “It helps that the AL West is not a juggernaut, and the Astros’ empire is on the decline.\n \n\n   \n  “So, yes, I do think the Mariners can reach the World Series in the near future. They’ll have to get more of that  Humpy The Salmon  magic back, though.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt, meanwhile, calls the season a “massive success” overall, adding: “I would say sting of disappointment still lingers, but there is a lot of optimism about this current roster.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/putin-strategy-trump-russia-sanctions-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"As US gets tough on Moscow, has Putin’s strategy of playing Trump run its course?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the United States adopts a tougher stance toward Russia under President Donald Trump, the Kremlin's long-standing strategy of manipulating Trump through diplomatic engagement and economic incentives appears to have failed.

Trump canceled a proposed summit with Putin in Budapest, dismissing Russian claims of no obstacles, and has now taken steps to pressure Putin into negotiations over Ukraine's territorial integrity—especially regarding the Donbas region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders see this as a critical step toward forcing a peace deal. However, concerns remain that Trump’s unpredictable nature could lead to a sudden reversal through another phone call with Putin, undermining the new strategy.","keyTakeAways":["The Kremlin's strategy of playing on Trump's desire for a peace deal in Ukraine by offering economic deals and military pressure has reportedly run its course.","New US Treasury sanctions on Russia’s top oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, are intended to pressure Putin, despite Russia’s history of circumventing sanctions.","Trump canceled a proposed summit with Putin in Budapest, Hungary, signaling a shift toward a more confrontational stance.","Putin’s strategy of manipulating Trump through diplomatic engagement and economic incentives has failed, as Trump now appears willing to act decisively on Ukraine.","Russia’s claim of no obstacles to the summit was dismissed, indicating that Kremlin optimism was misplaced.","The US aims to force Putin to compromise on war objectives, including demands for territory in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European officials view these US actions as crucial for bringing Russia to the negotiating table.","Despite the new tough stance, there remains concern that Trump’s unpredictable nature could allow a sudden reversal via a phone call with Putin."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Donald Trump","whatIsThisEntity":"Former U.S. President","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Trump is central to the narrative of shifting U.S. policy toward Russia, as his decision to cancel the summit with Putin and impose sanctions signals a new, more assertive stance against Russian aggression."},{"name":"Vladimir Putin","whatIsThisEntity":"President of Russia","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Putin is the focal point of the Kremlin's diplomatic strategy aimed at influencing Trump, and his actions—such as pushing forward military aggression and seeking a summit—are central to the article’s analysis."},{"name":"Dmitry Medvedev","whatIsThisEntity":"Former Russian President, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Medvedev publicly criticized Trump as a 'talkative peacemaker' and accused him of embarking on a war path against Russia, showing the internal Russian leadership’s view of Trump’s approach."},{"name":"Volodymyr Zelensky","whatIsThisEntity":"President of Ukraine","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Zelensky has described U.S. sanctions and policy shifts as 'very important' and crucial for bringing Russia to negotiations, underscoring Ukraine’s role as a key stakeholder in the conflict."},{"name":"Rosneft","whatIsThisEntity":"Russian oil company","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Rosneft is one of Russia’s largest oil producers and was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, representing a direct economic pressure measure against Russia."},{"name":"Lukoil","whatIsThisEntity":"Russian oil company","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Lukoil is another of Russia’s top oil producers and was sanctioned along with Rosneft, indicating targeted economic sanctions aimed at weakening Russia’s war economy."},{"name":"International Criminal Court","whatIsThisEntity":"International body","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"The Kremlin is facing an indictment for war crimes at the ICC, which undermines its international legitimacy and adds pressure to its position in negotiations."},{"name":"Budapest, Hungary","whatIsThisEntity":"City, proposed summit location","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"The proposed summit between Trump and Putin was to take place in Budapest, highlighting a diplomatic event that was canceled, signaling a turning point in U.S.-Russia relations."},{"name":"Donbas","whatIsThisEntity":"Region in eastern Ukraine","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Russia’s demand for Ukrainian surrender of territory in Donbas is a key war objective and a red line for Ukraine and its allies, central to peace negotiations."}],"importantDates":[{"dateMentionedInArticle":"1115-10-23","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The article was updated on this date, indicating a recent development in US-Russia-Ukraine relations, particularly regarding Trump's policy shift and new sanctions."}],"importantTimeframes":[{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2024","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The article discusses developments during the Trump administration (particularly the last nine months of his presidency), highlighting a shift in US policy toward Russia as a result of strategic recalibration."}],"tags":["US-Russia relations","Ukrainian war","Donald Trump","Vladimir Putin","sanctions","Donbas","peace negotiations","diplomatic strategy","economic pressure"],"content":"\n\t As US gets tough on Moscow, has Putin’s strategy of playing Trump run its course? \n       \n  Analysis by Matthew Chance, CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Kremlin may have convinced itself that US President Donald Trump didn’t have the stomach to apply real pressure on Moscow to end the  brutal conflict in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  It was, after all, just a carefully timed Kremlin phone call to the White House last week that convinced the US president to back away from his own threats of providing long-range  Tomahawk missiles  to Kyiv, missiles that could have made a real difference on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  But the  new US Treasury sanctions  on Russia’s two biggest oil companies may now force the Kremlin strongman, Vladimir Putin, to finally reassess his American counterpart, if not his Ukrainian war.\n \n\n   \n  Already an outspoken Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, has slammed Trump as “the talkative peacemaker who has now fully embarked on the war path against Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is his conflict now, not the senile Biden’s,” Medvedev added in a social media post, referring provocatively to the former US president.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not that the sanctions themselves are particularly tough. True, oil is essential to the Russian economy, funding the Kremlin’s costly war in Ukraine. It’s also true that Rosneft and Lukoil, sanctioned along with dozens of their subsidiaries, are Russia’s most significant oil producers.\n \n\n   \n  But Russia, one of the world’s most sanctioned countries, has proven adept at finding ways of circumventing these kinds of punitive measures in the past. It will, according to senior Russian officials, seek to do so again.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision will not pose any particular problems for us. Our country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to confidently develop its economic and energy potential,” said Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, in a televised press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The bigger problem for the Kremlin is that its favorite and well-tested strategy to manipulate the Trump White House – holding out the prospect of engagement on peace in Ukraine and dangling lucrative economic deals, while pressing ahead with its relentless military onslaught – appears to have run its course.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, the US president, who has  for months suspected  the Kremlin may be simply “tapping (him) along” on Ukraine, has decided to act.\n \n\n   \n  As well as imposing his first proper sanctions on Russia since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump also “canceled” a  proposed summit  with Putin in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  Just hours before, Russian officials – relishing the chance of another face-to-face presidential meeting – insisted there were “no obstacles” and that arrangements were actively being made, dismissing any suggestions of the summit being shelved.\n \n\n   \n  But, in retrospect, that optimism appears to have been Kremlin wishful thinking too. Putin is, of course, extremely keen to show Russians and the wider world that – despite sanctions and an indictment for war crimes at the  International Criminal Court  – that he is far from isolated on the international stage.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump rolled out the red carpet for him in Alaska this August, the leader of the world’s most powerful nation standing  shoulder to shoulder  with the Kremlin boss, it was an easy diplomatic win for the Kremlin, which offered little to the White House in return.\n \n\n   \n  There will, apparently, be no repeat performance in Budapest unless and until progress is made on Ukraine. The US Treasury has even suggested that more powerful American sanctions on Russia could follow, to further pressure the Kremlin into quickly talking peace.\n \n\n   \n  It could be the start of what critics of Trump’s handling of the Kremlin have long been calling for: a tough, new strategy to finally use considerable US leverage to try and force Putin to compromise on his maximalist war objectives.\n \n\n   \n  These include Kremlin demands for Kyiv to surrender strategic swathes of territory in  the Donbas , in eastern Ukraine, which Russia has so far been unable to conquer –  a red line  for the Ukrainian government and its European backers.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has described the US moves as “very important” and crucial to “bring Russia to the negotiating table.” Meanwhile, European officials have also expressed satisfaction with Washington’s apparently more hardline stance.\n \n\n   \n  But after nine months trapped on the rollercoaster ride of this latest Trump presidency, there are ever-present anxieties. And behind the scenes in Kyiv, in Brussels and even in Moscow, few doubt that in the erratic, mercurial world of Trump, a sudden switch back to the Kremlin’s point of view could be just another friendly, carefully-timed phone call with Putin away.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/tech/google-diversity-programs-women-techmakers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:24:00.000Z","title":"Their history is just erased: Google drops a key program for boosting women in tech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Google has discontinued its Women Techmakers program, a global initiative launched in 2012 to support women in technology through training, events, and community building.

October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The email that said the career resource program for women would no longer be part of Google was terse and followed months of eroding support. But the deletion of years of Women Techmakers’ work came as a significant shock to its members.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything that I ever hosted and facilitated for Women Techmakers is gone. And there are just as many ambassadors who were in the community that put in so much effort to be part of this, (and) their history just erased,” Sherry Yang, an engineering manager in Canada and an ambassador for the group, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Google earlier this month offloaded the key career resource program for supporting women in tech and severed its integration within the company. The decision was communicated to members in a short email with little explanation earlier this month. It left members feeling surprised, upset and sidelined as the company removed years’ worth of content and videos they created.\n \n\n   \n  The end of Women Techmakers served as another sign the search giant is unwinding its diversity programs as such initiatives face increasing political pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Google announced an external organization called Technovation will take over the group, but members of Women Techmakers told CNN they feel they have lost an important direct association and pipeline with one of the world’s most influential technology companies.\n \n\n   \n  “The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,” Vassiliki Dalakiari, a former Women Techmakers ambassador and AI research and development manager in Greece, told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.”\n \n\n   \n  Google declined to comment. A person with knowledge of the program said that Google is supporting and providing funding to Technovation through the transition phase and that the company believes in Technovation’s “ability to execute impactful, global programs.”\n \n\n   \n  Technovation CEO Tara Chklovski told CNN that the organization is getting funding from Google “to provide deeper programmatic support” to Women Techmaker members. The group will still have access to events, programs and “technology leaders from multinational companies from around the world (in addition to Google),” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the members say they feel tossed aside by Google after years of building a community many said helped them in their career and personally, as they forged their careers in a male-dominated industry.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Big fat silence’\n \n\n   \n  Women Techmakers  started at Google in 2012  to provide “visibility, community, and resources for women in technology” around the world through trainings, scholarships and event funding, regardless of whether they worked at Google. The most involved and experienced members could become ambassadors and even get funding to help them attend Google developer events.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Google  told employees  that it would no longer set diversity hiring targets and would evaluate its other diversity programs. The company said as a federal contractor, it needed to comply with President Donald Trump’s  executive order  on diversity, equity and inclusion programs for government agencies and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Women Techmakers who spoke to CNN said they started noticing a shift since then.\n \n\n   \n  One member of Women Techmakers based in Asia, who asked to only be identified as Tia, said it became increasingly difficult for ambassadors to get support for events and travel funding.\n \n\n   \n  Dalakiari told CNN that Women Techmakers Ambassadors did not receive the same level of support as they had in the past for the company’s Berlin developers conference over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no travel coverage, no invitation to the community events or meetups. It felt like we were included in name, but not in practice,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in early October, members received short emails, obtained by CNN, informing them that the program would end at Google and shift to Technovation, which started as a youth technology education organization 20 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Technovation says its mission is expanding to include adults and has vowed to maintain Women Techmakers’ mission and approach – as well as access to Google events and programs. But many women in tech said Google’s handling of the news signalled it wanted to quickly distance itself from diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “No global call. No formal announcement. No real explanation… just an email, and a big fat silence since then,” Leyla Damoisaux-Delnoy, a Brussels-based data scientist,  posted  on LinkedIn. “When a company’s commitment to equality ends with an email, it says a lot about what the commitment was really worth.”\n \n\n   \n  Several members CNN spoke to said they were shocked when Women Techmakers YouTube videos and LinkedIn posts were removed without warning. For some members like Yang, that meant vital proof of their work with the global internet juggernaut — like videos of events they led and panels they moderated — suddenly disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Tia said she and other members are feeling “something between devastation and rage.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a global women-in-tech program without informing or engaging its most active contributors sends a clear message and it’s disappointing,” Dalakiari said. “WTM made a real difference, and I’m not sure that decision reflects the values many of us signed up to represent.”\n \n\n   \n    Women in tech programs flailing\n \n\n   \n  Google’s decision to offload oversight of Women Techmakers is just the latest indication that tech giants are scaling back their diversity programs this year.\n \n\n   \n  Tech workers active in programs meant to support women in the field told CNN they have seen a noticeable shift in funding and support in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who studies workplace inequality, said tech firms previously made investments to improve women’s representation after facing scrutiny from gender equality organizations, federal regulators and their own employees.\n \n\n   \n  But things changed in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “The pressure from the federal government is off, and now they actually fear that the Trump administration will come after them if they have any targeted programs,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Internally, more tech companies like Amazon and Meta are  culling their diversity programs .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Dell shut down its Dell Women’s Entrepreneur Network (DWEN). The company told CNN in a statement that the sunsetting of the women’s program coincided with shutting down their “Dell for Startups” program and is part of a “broader internal business strategy shift.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our commitment to empowering small businesses and entrepreneurs and fostering an inclusive workplace and ecosystem remains unwavering,” the company said in part.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Google’s Women Techmakers program told CNN they believe Technovation is a reputable organization with good intentions. But they’re concerned that it won’t have the same funding or impact as a company with the size, resources and recognition of Google.\n \n\n   \n  Still, company culture matters more than dedicated programs when it comes to supporting women and other groups, Tomaskovic-Devey said.\n \n\n   \n  “It probably does not matter much if targeted programs return. What matters is if Google, or any of the other big tech firms, actually manage their workplaces so that everyone feels respected and included,” Tomaskovic-Devey said. “Poor management will lead to backsliding where it really matters, in the diversity, productivity, and creativity of their workforces.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/entertainment/kristen-bell-anniversary-post","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Kristen Bell’s Wedding Anniversary Joke Sparks Public Outcry Over Domestic Violence References","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kristen Bell sparked a public controversy on social media by celebrating her 12th wedding anniversary with Dax Shepard, sharing a quote from him about not killing her, which many criticized as tone-deaf and potentially minimizing domestic violence.

season on the line and a big bye week: 5 things to know about Week 8 of the NFL season \n       \n  By Andy Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  NFL  season’s getting real in Week 8.\n \n\n   \n  A legend faces his former team, bye weeks are piling up and teams are one loss away from trading playbooks for tickets to Cancun.\n \n\n   \n  Here are five things to know about Week 8.\n \n\n   \n    Big bye week bonanza\n \n\n   \n  Week 8 is the biggest bye week of the season – six teams are taking the week off, and fantasy football managers everywhere are feeling the pain.\n \n\n   \n  The Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks, Arizona Cardinals, Detroit Lions, Las Vegas Raiders and Jacksonville Jaguars are all off, leaving just 13 games on the slate. That’s three of the four NFC West teams resting, with only the San Francisco 49ers still in action.\n \n\n   \n  It’s officially “scramble to the waiver wire” season. If you’re starting multiple tight ends owned in only 20% of leagues this week, don’t worry – you are not alone.\n \n\n   \n    The Texans’ offense: So bad, it’s historic\n \n\n   \n  Houston’s defense has been lights out – their offense, eh, not so much. The Texans have allowed the fewest points in the league yet sit at 2-4.\n \n\n   \n  They’re the first team in  NFL  history to lead the league in fewest points allowed and still have a losing record through seven weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The good news? They face a 49ers defense that’s really banged up and can’t seem to catch the ball. San Francisco hasn’t intercepted a pass in 14 straight games – the longest drought since 1950. The only other team without a pick this season: the winless New York Jets.\n \n\n   \n  So maybe, just maybe, this is the week the Texans’ offense finally wakes up.\n \n\n   \n    Rodgers’ ‘Revenge’ (sort of)\n \n\n   \n  For the first time in his career, Aaron Rodgers will face his old team – the Green Bay Packers. And this time, he’s doing it as the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers spent 18 seasons in Green Bay, winning a Super Bowl, four regular season MVPs and becoming a franchise legend. Now, at 41, he’ll look across the field at the team that defined his career.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers insists it’s not a revenge game, saying he still has “a lot of love” for the organization – but don’t be surprised if he saves a little extra magic for Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers is currently fourth in the league with 14 touchdown passes, proving the man still has plenty left in the tank.\n \n\n   \n    The Broncos’ Mile-High Miracle\n \n\n   \n  The Denver Broncos pulled off one of the wildest comebacks in NFL history last Sunday. Down 18 points to the  New York Giants  with less than six minutes left, Denver erupted for 33 fourth-quarter points to somehow win.\n \n\n   \n  Before that, teams trailing by 18 or more with under six minutes remaining had lost 1,602 straight games. That streak – gone. Giants fans may never emotionally recover.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Denver gets the Dallas Cowboys at home, as they look to keep the magic going and stay atop the AFC West.\n \n\n   \n    Ravens’ season on the brink\n \n\n   \n  It’s not officially a playoff game, but it might as well be.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens host the Chicago Bears in what feels like a must-win for a 1-5 Baltimore squad that’s been wrecked by injuries. Only four teams in NFL history have started 1-5 and still made the playoffs – the last being the 2020 Washington Football Team.\n \n\n   \n  The silver lining: Lamar Jackson is expected to return from his hamstring injury, just in time to face a red-hot Bears team that’s won four straight for the first time in seven years.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s offense under head coach Ben Johnson has been rolling – they’re the only team in the NFL to score 21 or more in every game this season.\n \n\n   \n  For Baltimore, the margin for error is gone. It’s win now… or start thinking about next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/basketball-nba-wednesday-review-wembanyama-flagg-edgecombe-intl","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00Z","title":"","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":""},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/style/jennifer-lawrence-sweater-red-carpet","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Look of the Week: Jennifer Lawrence’s slouchy sweater gets the red carpet treatment","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jennifer Lawrence’s choice of a slouchy, two-toned sweater at the Rome Film Festival in October 2025 challenges the traditional formality of red carpet fashion, signaling a broader cultural shift toward authenticity and relaxed style.

Jennifer Lawrence’s slouchy sweater gets the red carpet treatment \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Jennifer Lawrence walked the red carpet at the Rome Film Festival this week, she did so while wearing a two-toned V-neck sweater and a lightweight tiered white skirt. Her cozy knit pullover was weather-appropriate for a fall October evening, but formal wear puritans might question whether it was red carpet-appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  Sweaters are not often associated with glamorous event arrivals, at least not in recent memory. For the last 15 or so years, celebrities have been, in general, more trussed up, as red carpets have become a heightened economic prospective for stars and designers alike. These days, it’s not unusual for  an ornate gown to come with a sculptural headpiece , or be completed by a train that reaches beyond several meters. Earlier this year the Cannes Film Festival organizers even went as far as banning “voluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train,” in their red carpet dress code after the “flow of traffic of guests” was being disrupted by too many larger-than-life frocks. Of course,  no one really listened .\n \n\n   \n  Lawrence’s ensemble still fit the bill (it was from Jonathan Anderson’s debut womenswear collection for Dior, after all). But it still ran counter to the impulse to do the  most , refusing the popular strategy of wearing the biggest, boldest gown — or, lately, the most transparent dress. There’s a reason nostalgic photos of 1990s film premieres are constantly recirculated on the internet: Red carpets looked more fun three decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  In a world before stylists and social media, celebrities had room to dress according to their mood and personal taste — not to mention the freedom to experiment away from the pitchforks of an Instagram comment section. Despite Lawrence’s outfit being straight from the runway, her easy-breezy, slouchy sweater called back to another era of Hollywood dressing. It also seemed to ask: Can red carpet fashion loosen up a bit?\n \n\n   \n  Lawrence’s style choices have posed that question before, for example when she paired a Dior red princess gown with a pair of  black flip flops  at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023. But she isn’t the only one challenging expectations. Last month, comedian and actor Megan Stalter made headlines for defying red carpet tradition by wearing a pair of blue Levi’s jeans and a white T-shirt to the 2025 Emmys.\n \n\n   \n  “I think people need to bring back jeans on the red carpet,” Stalter told Variety. “They were in the ‘90s… there’s no rules. You’re allowed to do what you want.”\n \n\n   \n  There have been other rumblings of a red carpet resistance: Taylor Russell dressed in vintage Levi’s and a Gucci white fur bolero for the Fashion Awards in 2022, and Kristen Stewart’s sweater dress (albeit sequinned and Chanel) at the Toronto Film Festival in 2018. But A-listers looking to really disrupt the sartorial status quo must make bigger statements — by being decidedly more understated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Takeaways from the second general election debate in the NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the second and final general election debate of the New York City mayoral race, Democrat Zohran Mamdani faced sharp personal and policy attacks from independent former governor Andrew Cuomo, who accused him of lacking experience and failing to address city problems.

election debate in the NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By David Wright, Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This time, the gloves came off.\n \n\n   \n  Democrat  Zohran Mamdani  clashed with independent  Andrew Cuomo  from the first moments of Wednesday’s second and final general election debate for New York City mayor. Cuomo called Mamdani divisive and said he lacked experience or new ideas, while Mamdani said the former governor, down in the polls, was a “desperate man lashing out.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo was looking for a moment to change the race’s contours less than two weeks from Election Day while Mamdani both sought to lock in his lead and establish himself  as winning the “battle over the soul” of the national Democratic Party . The two tore into each other in strikingly personal terms on their backgrounds, their policy ideas and how each would address antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  Republican nominee  Curtis Sliwa , meanwhile, reprised his wildcard role as he refuses to bow to a pressure campaign from some in his party to leave the race.\n \n\n   \n  Here are key moments from the debate:\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo gives Mamdani a dressing-down about experience\n \n\n   \n  In a pivot from his frequent reference to his time in government, Cuomo sought to put distance between his record as governor and New York City’s municipal failures. Notably for someone elected governor three times, Cuomo argued that “the city has been getting screwed by the state, and that has to change.”\n \n\n   \n  But the exchange gave Mamdani an opening to attack Cuomo for his record as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “The governor doesn’t build housing in New York City,” Cuomo said in response to a question on housing policy.\n \n\n   \n  “Not if it’s you,” Mamdani retorted.\n \n\n   \n  That led to Cuomo accusing Mamdani of never having “accomplished anything.”\n \n\n   \n  “I did things; you have never had a job,” Cuomo said motioning towards Mamdani and drawing applause from the crowd. “There is no reason to believe you have any merit or qualification for 8.5 million lives. You don’t know how to run a government.”\n \n\n   \n  He went on to paint Mamdani as an inexperienced legislator who is unprepared to lead America’s biggest city and would be dangerous in the event of an emergency.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know how to handle an emergency, and you literally never proposed a bill on anything that you’re not talking about in your campaign,” Cuomo said, his voice rising.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Mamdani accused Cuomo of creating “his own facts.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just had a former governor say in his own words that the city has been getting screwed by the state,” Mamdani said. “Who was leading the state? It was you. You were leading the state … screwing the city.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani tears into Cuomo’s experience argument\n \n\n   \n  “You will hear from Andrew Cuomo about his experience as if the issue is that we don’t know about it,” Mamdani said at one point. “The issue is that we have all experienced your experience.”\n \n\n   \n  To underscore that argument, Mamdani’s campaign invited to the debate Charlotte Bennett, a former aide in Cuomo’s administration who  accused him of sexual harassment  in 2021. Cuomo resigned from office under the cloud of that investigation though he has denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Given a chance to question Cuomo, Mamdani raised the sexual harassment cases.\n \n\n   \n  “You sought to access her private gynecological records,” Mamdani said. “She cannot speak up for herself because you lodged a defamation case against her. I, however, can speak. What do you say to the 13 women that you sexually harassed?”\n \n\n   \n  The question drew applause from Mamdani supporters in the audience. Cuomo responded at first by suggesting Mamdani was being unserious and immature. He then launched into his defense, saying five district attorneys declined to pursue the cases and that he has not been found criminally or civilly liable.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo then turned to Mamdani to attack him for appearing in a picture with a Ugandan politician known for her anti-LGBTQ positions.\n \n\n   \n   “Had I known that the first deputy minister was the architect of that legislation, I would not have taken that photo,” Mamdani said. “I also know that this constant attempt to smear and slander me is an attempt to also distract from the fact that, unlike myself, you do not actually have a platform or set of policies to protect those same New Yorkers here.”\n \n\n   \n    The three candidates talk about ICE and Trump\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids in New York City emerged as a flashpoint early in the debate, as all three candidates rejected the federal crackdown and argued over who was best able to deal with President Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo said that “we don’t need ICE to do quality-of-life crimes,” after a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement  raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street  in Manhattan Tuesday. Mamdani argued the agency “cares little for the law and even less for the people that they’re supposed to serve.” And Sliwa agreed that “the feds should not have stepped into this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  But the candidates diverged sharply on how they’d approach Trump. Cuomo said that “you’re going to have to confront” him while Sliwa suggested that “you can’t beat Trump, he holds most of the cards,” saying that “you have to try to negotiate.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, meanwhile, said that he was open to working with Trump on lowering the cost of living but pivoted to attacking Cuomo, saying that Trump “wants Andrew Cuomo to be the mayor, not because it will be good for New Yorkers, but because it will be good for him.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo shot back that Trump would take advantage of Mamdani’s youth and inexperience to press his crackdown on the city.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump, I believe, wants Mamdani. That is his dream, because he will use him politically all across the country, and he will take over New York City. Make no mistake, it will be President Trump and Mayor Trump, and he will come in and take over the city,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Then he worked in a bit of Yiddish.\n \n\n   \n  “He has no respect for him,” Cuomo said. “He thinks he’s a kid and he’s going to knock him on his tuchus.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani’s rivals gang up on him about ballot measures\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo and Sliwa briefly ganged up on Mamdani over his refusal to take a position on a set of controversial ballot measures New Yorkers will weigh in this election year.\n \n\n   \n  At one point, holding his hands up in the air and swaying side to side as if to mock Mamdani for talking too much, Cuomo attacked Mamdani for not having yet made his position clear.\n \n\n   \n  “What a political answer. What is your opinion, Zohran?” Sliwa demanded.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes or no?” Cuomo joined in.\n \n\n   \n  “I think on this stage, you can see two people appealing for the Republican Party’s votes,” Mamdani chimed in over the crosstalk. Pressed to answer, he conceded, “I have not yet taken a position on those ballot amendments.”\n \n\n   \n  There are six ballot proposals covering a range of topics, including significant housing reform, a change to election years and the construction of a sports complex on forest land.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani sends a clear signal about policing\n \n\n   \n  For months, Mamdani has said  he would consider keeping New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch  if elected but has stopped short of committing to asking her to stay on.\n \n\n   \n  That changed Wednesday. Just before the debate began, two people familiar with the plan confirmed to CNN that Mamdani intends to ask Tisch to stay on the job if he is elected mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s decision,  first reported  by The New York Times, signals his attempt to moderate as the general election nears and he continues to face criticism, especially on his previous critiques of the police.\n \n\n   \n  “I can confirm that reporting,” Mamdani said on the debate stage.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has walked back previous calls to defund the police and has apologized to officers for referring to them as “racist” and “wicked” in social media posts.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear if Tisch, who is highly regarded in the city’s political circles, would stay on even if asked.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo and Sliwa also said they would ask Tisch to stay on as commissioner.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani faces criticism about antisemitism\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani  again addressed Jewish voters  who are concerned about his criticisms of Israel and question his commitment to fighting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  “I look forward to being a mayor for every single person that calls the city home,” he said, adding: “All 8.5 million New Yorkers, and that includes Jewish New Yorkers who may have concerns or opposition to the positions that I’ve shared about Israel and Palestine.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s opponents, however, expressed skepticism and accused him of promoting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re the savior of the Jewish people? You won’t denounce ‘Globalize the Intifada,’ which means ‘Kill Jews,’” Cuomo said, referencing the controversial phrase that  Mamdani has discouraged using  and noting that hundreds of rabbis had signed a letter criticizing him. “There’s unprecedented fear in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa made a personal appeal to Mamdani, referencing his own Jewish family members, saying that members of the community were “scared.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me speak on behalf of my two sons when they’ve heard some of the statements you’ve made,” Sliwa said. “They view you as the arsonist who fans the flames of antisemitism. They cannot suddenly accept the fact that you’re coming in like a firefighter and you’re going to put out these flames. You’ve got a lot of explaining to do, a lot of apologizing to do.”\n \n\n   \n  He also alleged that Mamdani, who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor, had praised “global jihad.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani responded that “there is room for disagreement on many positions and many policies.” But he also pushed back.\n \n\n   \n  “I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said and that continues to be ascribed to me,” he said. “And frankly, I think much of it has to do with the fact that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election.”\n \n\n   \n    Sliwa goes after Cuomo; Cuomo fires back\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s allies have pressured Sliwa to drop out of the race so the former governor can consolidate opposition to Mamdani. Sliwa has rejected that push with his characteristic bluntness and color, referencing the movie “Braveheart” earlier Wednesday in  suggesting he would choose death  over working for a Cuomo mayoral administration.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa challenged Cuomo repeatedly, including on the sexual misconduct allegations that led him to resign as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “The only reason that Zohran is on this stage is because of the failed Gov. Cuomo, who was rejected by the Democrats in the primary and rejected by 13 women who charged you with sexual harassment,” Sliwa said. “Do you ever know that no means no? Do you know what no means, Cuomo?”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo responded by accusing Sliwa of tax fraud, claiming that he’d failed to properly disclose donations to his crime prevention organization, the Guardian Angels. “So I think that’s the person who has explaining to do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At another point, Sliwa accused Cuomo of cutting funding for hospital beds for people with mental illnesses, ending his point with “Shame on you!”\n \n\n   \n  Retorted Cuomo: “There’s one bed I’m going to save for you.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/graham-platner-maine-senate-controversy","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00Z","title":"New Cabinet Announced Amid Political Transition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 15, 2024, Prime Minister Elena Vasquez announced a new government cabinet as part of a political transition following recent elections.

beef deal angers America’s struggling farmers: ‘You’re selling us out’ \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said this week he “loved” America’s cattle ranchers. But those farmers, who overwhelmingly supported the president in the 2024 election, say they aren’t feeling the love right now.\n \n\n   \n   Trump is facing criticism  from many US cattle ranchers after signaling support for increasing low-tariff beef imports from Argentina to ease record beef prices in the United States. The move comes just weeks after US soybean farmers blasted a separate deal with Argentina that they fear will give South American producers a competitive edge in that market.\n \n\n   \n  Argentina currently accounts for just over 2% of US beef imports. Under existing rules, it can ship up to 20,000 metric tons a year at a lower tariff rate, with anything above that subject to a 26.4% tariff, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN the administration plans to raise that quota to 80,000 metric tons, effectively quadrupling the amount of Argentinian beef with low tariffs that can enter the United States.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said: “Currently, Americans consume 12 million metric tons of beef. 10 million, we produce in this country. 2 million, we import. Out of 12 million, [the Argentine quota] would be 20,000 every quarter. This is not a massive influx in the millions of tons I think that some have thought of beef from Argentina.”\n \n\n   \n  But Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle farmer and the senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan farm organization, said: “If Trump goes through with what he outlined, I do believe it’s a betrayal of the American rancher. It’s a feeling that you’re selling us out to a foreign competitor.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump reacted to the backlash from cattle ranchers.\n \n\n   \n  “The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil,” Trump wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade association for beef producers, said the organization and its members “cannot stand behind the President while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers by importing Argentinian beef in an attempt to influence prices.”\n \n\n   \n    Why beef prices are at record highs\n \n\n   \n  The price of beef  has climbed significantly this year , up nearly 14% in the past year, according to the latest inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August. (A fresh read on consumer prices is set to be released Friday.)\n \n\n   \n  Becca Jablonski, an agricultural economist who teaches at Cornell University’s Johnson School of Business, said the price increase is fueled by multiple factors.\n \n\n   \n  A recent, multi-year drought decreased the amount of grazing land for cattle and made feed grain significantly more expensive, resulting in a shortage of cattle, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage has also been made worse by an infestation of New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, just across the border in Mexico, significantly curtailing beef imports from that country.\n \n\n   \n  Jablonski said that historically the livestock sector barely makes money, but is having a rare positive year, which allows farmers to pay down debts they accrued during unprofitable years.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the argument the industry is making is, ‘Let us have one good year,’” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the president is keeping his promises to defend farmers and consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump pledged to protect America’s ranchers and deliver economic relief for everyday Americans. The Administration is accomplishing both by expanding beef imports from Argentina to lower consumer prices in the short term while rolling out a new USDA initiative that will support ranchers and expand cattle herd sizes to keep prices lower in the long term,” Kelly said.\n \n\n   \n  Lovell said many of the farmers he knows are just scraping by.\n \n\n   \n  “It is not uncommon for folks in farming to have a year where they report a loss,” he said. “You cannot look at cattle producers that had one good year and say, ‘Oh my gosh, they are just making out like bandits.’”\n \n\n   \n  Lovell blamed price increases on the large meatpacking corporations that buy product from US ranchers and package it for grocery stores.\n \n\n   \n  An influx of imported beef would hurt US farmers, he said, because the large meat packers are not required to label what country their beef comes from.\n \n\n   \n    Soybean farmers reeling from tariff spat\n \n\n   \n  There are some signs that support for Trump in farm country has begun to fray. He won 93% of rural counties in the 2024 election, the highest share of any Republican presidential candidate this century,  according  to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan research organization.\n \n\n   \n  But soybean farmers were among  the first to feel the pain  of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs with China. Since May, China has effectively boycotted American soybeans as a response to Trump’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Even before tariffs, the family farming industry in the United States was already hurting. Since 2017, the country has lost more than 17% of its family farms — at least 100,000 operations — according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs may be exacerbating that pain. Farm bankruptcies  rose in the first half of the year  to the highest level since 2021, according to US courts data.\n \n\n   \n  John Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer and the founder of The National Black Farmers Association, said he had never had a problem selling his soybeans until recently.\n \n\n   \n  “Now nobody’s buying it,” Boyd said. “The largest purchaser of our soybeans was China, and they haven’t placed any orders. Zero.”\n \n\n   \n  “The president thinks his tariffs are the best thing since sliced bread, and it’s putting America’s farmers out of business,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The administration drew backlash last month after agreeing to provide $20 billion in currency support to help stabilize the Argentine peso, a move critics have characterized as effectively bailing out Argentina.\n \n\n   \n   A text message, seen by CNN , sent by Secretary Rollins to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggested that Argentina then used that financial lifeline to strike a deal with China on soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  “We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return the Argentine’s (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,” the message said.\n \n\n   \n  “Here we are losing our farms, and the president is helping out a foreign country,” Boyd said of the deal.\n \n\n   \n    USDA steps in\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  sources told CNN  the White House was planning to extend a multibillion-dollar bailout for farmers. With the government shutdown stretching past its third week, no plan has materialized yet.\n \n\n   \n  Although the USDA has been largely shuttered during the government shutdown, the agency on Wednesday  announced  a plan it said would “strengthen the American beef industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan includes expanding ranchers’ access to federal land for grazing and prioritizing grant applications from military veterans looking to enter the industry, among other measures.\n \n\n   \n  Lovell said that while the plan may be welcome news to many farmers, he felt it didn’t go far enough to protect the industry.\n \n\n   \n  “What US ranchers need is a fair market with the right incentives. We’ve got to encourage rebuilding the cow herd here in the US,” he said.  “This seems to be a quick attempt to control the damage.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/health/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"COVID-19 vaccines may help some cancer patients fight tumors","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study from researchers at the MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Florida suggests that receiving a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy treatment significantly improves survival rates for patients with advanced lung or skin cancer.

Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines,  cutting $500 million in funding  for some uses of the technology.\n \n\n   \n  But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.\n \n\n   \n  A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack.  Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak . It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.\n \n\n   \n  Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the  Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines , scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.\n \n\n   \n  The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”\n \n\n   \n  Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.\n \n\n   \n  Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.\n \n\n   \n  So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.\n \n\n   \n  Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/style/paris-fondation-cartier-jean-nouvel","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Fondation Cartier’s new home opens in Paris, in a prized spot facing the Louvre","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Fondation Cartier has opened a new, centrally located museum in Paris, directly opposite the Louvre, following a multi-year renovation.

Paris, in a prized spot facing the Louvre \n       \n  Vivian Song\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After a years-long renovation project, the Fondation Cartier art museum will open its doors on Saturday to its new home, opposite the Louvre in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  While little has changed externally, the stately 19th-century building, which was a former hotel and department store, has undergone a radical redesign within. The Haussmannian building has been transformed by  Pritzker prize-winning  architect Jean Nouvel, who describes his latest project as an “industrial cathedral” of modular spaces.\n \n\n   \n  The dramatic 70,000-square-foot exhibition space features tall bay windows that create a sense of transparency, blurring the boundaries between the inside and outside world.\n \n\n   \n  Pedestrians, bikers and the city’s traffic serve as complementary, theatrical background sets, while curious passersby can peek through the windows to catch glimpses of the artworks. High glass ceilings near the main entrance funnel in natural light.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Dercon, the museum’s managing director, told CNN that the design “is a dialogue with the history and urban context of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  But the most interesting design feature is no doubt the system of five steel, mobile platforms that can be raised and lowered in nearly a dozen ways to reconfigure the exhibition space, in order to “reinvent” the visitor experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing is permanent,” Mathieu Forest, director of production and architectural design at Ateliers Jean Nouvel studios, told journalists at Monday’s press preview.\n \n\n   \n  “Not the floor, not the walls, not the ceiling…next time, maybe this platform will be higher or lower. You will have an entirely new perspective.”\n \n\n   \n  Cables and pulleys have also been left deliberately exposed, he adds, as they are “live tools” for artists and curators.\n \n\n   \n  The adjustable viewing platforms can also offer different perspectives – and experiences – of a single piece. Standing floor level and gazing head on at Colombian artist Olga de Amaral’s monumental textile work, “Muros en rojos,” reveals the fine details of the thousands of wool and horsehair mosaic-like strips.\n \n\n   \n  Climbing up a few flights of stairs for a view from above and afar, however, changes the viewer’s relationship to the tapestry, as it becomes an autumnal, pixelated amber, red and burnt ochre backdrop that evokes the colors of Amaral’s native Bogota landscape.\n \n\n   \n  “Contemporary art takes on extremely varied forms,” notes Emilie Besse, a French journalist who specializes in the intersection of art and luxury.\n \n\n   \n  “And if we want to be able to present absolutely all forms of creative expression, you need a space that can adapt.”\n \n\n   \n  The inaugural show “Exposition Générale,” is a nod to the building’s heritage as a former 19th century department store, the Grands Magasins du Louvre, which showcased the latest trends in fashion, technologies and household items in museum-like exhibits of the same name. Artworks, curated from the foundation’s existing collection, are categorized under four broad themes that explore architecture, the living world, techniques and materials, and the relationship between science and artistic creation.\n \n\n   \n  Where the modular configuration may risk confusion, however, is in the absence of direction or clear signage that can help visitors make sense of the thematically grouped works.\n \n\n   \n    Luxury brands’ influence on French art world\n \n\n   \n  The innovative arts space, which cost more than an estimated 230 million euros ($267 million) to renovate, according to French media, follows in the foundation’s tradition of shaping the city’s the modern art scene.\n \n\n   \n  When the museum first opened in 1984 in the Paris suburb of Jouy-en-Josas under the direction of Alain Dominique Perrin, it became the first corporate foundation in the country to promote contemporary art, paving the way for the likes of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, which opened in 2014, and the Bourse de Commerce, which houses the contemporary art collection of Kering founder François Pinault and opened in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to understand that, unlike other countries, culture in France has been, for decades, and centuries even, something that was supported by the public sector and that belonged to the state,” explains Fabien Simode, president of the French chapter of the Association of International Art Critics.\n \n\n   \n  “When Cartier arrived in the 1980s, they showed that another path was possible.”\n \n\n   \n  While the relationship between luxury brands and cultural institutions is now firmly established in France, Besse acknowledges that it can still cause some discomfort among some critics.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, when the Grand Palais, which has received tens of millions of euros in donations from Chanel, named one of its main entrance ways after the brand’s founder, Gabrielle Chanel, it raised concerns of commercial opportunism and appropriation of a heritage site, Besse said.\n \n\n   \n  “But ultimately there are very strong affinities between luxury and art, as luxury brands have historically been houses of expertise and creation,” she adds. “So there’s a natural bridge between these two worlds.”\n \n\n   \n  Public and private, luxury-branded institutions also have drastically different approaches that decrease the risk of overlap or competition, Simode points out. While public institutions can sometimes be scientific, encyclopedic, even cold in their faithfulness to detail, private institutions often have more freedom to take an aesthetic and dynamic approach, and have proven their legitimacy, Simode adds.\n \n\n   \n    New visitors\n \n\n   \n  For its opening exhibition the foundation has curated 600 works by 100 international artists including David Lynch, Patti Smith and Damien Hirst, to Congolese artist Bodys Isek Kingelez and Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang.\n \n\n   \n  For Jean-Christophe Castelain, director of the Le Journal des Arts, a bimonthly art publication, the Fondation Cartier’s strength is in scouting international, sometimes little known talents who fall somewhere between big commercial artists whose work appeals to the general public, such as Jeff Koons, and the more obscure, experimental artists who can be radically niche.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fondation Cartier is somewhere in between, and that’s also what makes it so strong,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Castelain cites hyperrealist Australian sculptor Ron Mueck as an example of an artist who got a major boost from the foundation in France after becoming the first French institution to host a solo exhibition back in 2005, and then in 2013 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps more than its initial programming, it’s the museum’s newly central location, increased space – five times the area of its former home – and proximity to the world’s most visited museum, the Louvre, that will attract new audiences, notably tourists.\n \n\n   \n  Nouvel was also the architect behind the Fondation Cartier’s previous site, which opened in 1994 in a quieter neighborhood on the Left Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “The foundation has been moving towards the center of Paris over the last 40 years,” says Simode, adding that the move is analogous to the city’s growing importance on the international art scene.\n \n\n   \n  “Paris has returned to the center stage.”\n \n\n   \n   “Exposition Générale” is on view until August 2026. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/federal-worker-pay-bill-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Global AI Initiative to Revolutionize Climate Predictions","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The AI Climate Modeling Project, led by a global research consortium involving institutions from the United States, Europe, and Asia, is utilizing historical climate data and real-time satellite observations to train artificial intelligence models capable of simulating and predicting climate change with unprecedented precision.

Activists want to make it a model for the country \n       \n  By Audrey Dutton, ProPublica\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   This story was originally published by  ProPublica ,  a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.  Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive its stories in your inbox every week. \n \n\n   \n  Three women become choked up as they deliver news in a video posted to social media. “We did it, everybody,” says Leslie Manookian, the woman in the middle. She is a driving force in a campaign that has chipped away at the foundations of modern public health in Idaho. The group had just gotten lawmakers to pass what she called the first true “medical freedom” bill in the nation. “It’s literally landmark,” Manookian said. “It is changing everything.”\n \n\n   \n  With Manookian in  the video  are two of her allies, the leaders of Health Freedom Idaho. It was April 4, hours after the governor signed the  Idaho Medical Freedom Act  into law.\n \n\n   \n  The act makes it illegal for state and local governments, private businesses, employers, schools and daycares to require anyone to take a vaccine or receive any other “medical intervention.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether the law will actually alter day-to-day life in Idaho is an open question, because Idaho already made it easy to get around the few existing vaccination requirements.\n \n\n   \n  But it could have a significant effect in other states, where rules aren’t already so relaxed. And it comes at a time when diseases once eradicated from the U.S. through vaccination are making a resurgence.\n \n\n   \n  The law runs against one of the hallmarks of modern public health: that a person’s full participation in society depends on their willingness to follow certain rules. (Want to send your child to public school? They’ll need a measles vaccine. Want to work in a retirement community during flu season? You might have to wear a mask.)\n \n\n   \n  The new Idaho law flips that on its head. It not only removes the obligation to follow such rules, it makes the rules themselves illegal.\n \n\n   \n  The new law sets Idaho apart from even conservative-leaning South Carolina, where  two schools recently  quarantined more than 150 unvaccinated children after measles arrived.\n \n\n   \n  A person  can spread measles  for four days before symptoms appear. During the South Carolina schools’ quarantine, five students began to show symptoms, but the quarantine kept them from spreading it,  the health department said this month .\n \n\n   \n  That precaution would now be illegal in Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s law caught the attention of people who share Manookian’s belief that — contrary to  hundreds of years of public health evidence and rigorous regulation in the U.S.  — vaccines are worse than the diseases they prevent.\n \n\n   \n  It also caught the attention of people like Jennifer Herricks, a pro-vaccine advocate in Louisiana and  advocacy director for American Families for Vaccines .\n \n\n   \n  Herricks and her counterparts in other states say that vaccine requirements have “done so much good for our kids and for our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  An  analysis published last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  found that routine childhood vaccines prevented more than 1.1 million deaths and 32 million hospitalizations in the U.S. over three decades, saving $540 billion in direct costs and saving society about $2.7 trillion. The analysis was limited; it didn’t account for the lives and money saved by vaccines for flu or RSV, which kill and hospitalize babies and children each year.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s move was “pretty concerning,” Herricks said, “especially seeing the direction that everything is headed at the federal government.”\n \n\n   \n  The law is the culmination of a decade of anti-vaccine activism that got a boost from the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  It’s rooted in a belief system that distrusts institutions — government health agencies, vaccine makers, medical societies and others — on the premise that those institutions seek only money and control.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian said in an interview that she believes one person should never be told to risk their health in “the theoretical” service of another.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Manookian and her allies have a new goal in their sights: to make Idaho’s legislation a nationwide standard.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho was already more permissive than other states when it came to vaccine rules. Parents since at least the 1990s could send unvaccinated children to school if they signed a form saying vaccination went against their religious or personal beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  That wasn’t good enough for Idahoans who describe themselves as advocates for health freedom. They worked to shift the paradigm, bit by bit, so that it can be easier now for parents to get a vaccine exemption than to show the school their child is actually vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, lawmakers ordered schools and daycare centers to tell parents about  the exemptions allowed in Idaho  whenever they communicate about immunizations.\n \n\n   \n  The state also decided to let parents exempt their kids by writing a note, instead of having to fill out a form — one that, in the past, required them to acknowledge the risks of going unvaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  (There is conflicting data on whether these changes truly affected vaccination rates or just led more parents to skip the trouble of handing in vaccine records. Starting in 2021, Idaho schools reported a steady drop in the share of kindergartners with documented vaccinations.  Phone surveys  of parents, by contrast, showed vaccination rates have been largely unchanged.)\n \n\n   \n  An enduring backlash against Idaho’s short-lived COVID-19 mandates gave Manookian’s movement more momentum, culminating this year in what she considered the ultimate step in Idaho’s evolution.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian had a previous career in finance in New York and London. She transitioned to work as a homeopath and advocate, ultimately returning to her home state of Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  The bill she came up with said that almost nobody can be required to have a vaccine or take any test or medical procedure or treatment in order to go to school, get a job or go about life how they’d like to. In practice, that would mean schools couldn’t send unvaccinated kids home, even during a measles outbreak, and private businesses and daycares couldn’t require people on their property to follow public health guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.\n \n\n   \n  Her theory was right, ultimately.\n \n\n   \n  The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.\n \n\n   \n  But the governor vetoed it.  In a letter , he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.\n \n\n   \n  This time, Little signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, D.C., for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.\n \n\n   \n  At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian  told the audience  in May.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.\n \n\n   \n  Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing  model legislation and a how-to guide , with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit  Stand For Health Freedom  to mobilize activists in every state.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with ProPublica, Manookian said her objective is for people to “understand and appreciate that the most basic and fundamental of human rights is the right to direct our own medical treatment — and to codify that in law in every state. Breaking that barrier in Idaho proves that it can be done, that Americans understand the importance of this, and the humanity of it, and that it should be done in other states.”\n \n\n   \n  Her efforts were rewarded over the summer with a visit from none other than Kennedy, who visited Boise and toured a farm  with Manookian and state lawmakers in tow. \n \n\n   \n  “This state, more than any other state in the country” aligns with the MAHA campaign, Kennedy told reporters at a news conference where no one was allowed to ask questions. Kennedy called Idaho “the home of medical freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment from Kennedy or his staff on Idaho’s law and his visit to the state.\n \n\n   \n  Children’s Health Defense, the organization Kennedy built into one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines, took interest in the Idaho bill early on.\n \n\n   \n  The group promoted the bill as it sat on the governor’s desk, as he vetoed it, then as Manookian worked successfully to get a revived bill through the statehouse and signed into law.\n \n\n   \n  The organization’s online video programming featured Manookian five times in late March and early April. One show’s host told viewers they could follow Idaho in its “very smart strategy” of taking a law against COVID-related mandates, “crossing out ‘COVID,’ making a few other tweaks, and you have an incredible health freedom bill after that.”\n \n\n   \n  Children’s Health Defense CEO  Mary Holland  said she’s known Manookian for more than 15 years and pushed the national organization to publicize Manookian’s work. Holland introduced her at the Washington, D.C., event.\n \n\n   \n  Whereas most states put the onus on unvaccinated people to show why they should opt out of a mandate, Idaho’s legislation made unvaccinated people the norm — shifting the burden of accommodation onto those who support vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  Now, parents of infants too young for a measles vaccine can’t choose a daycare that requires immunization. Parents of immune-compromised students must decide whether to keep their children home from school during an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases, knowing unvaccinated children won’t be quarantined.\n \n\n   \n  Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements imposed by states like California and New York.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you could certainly do that in Idaho.” Holland said. “It wouldn’t be a public school. It might be the Church of Vaccinia school.”\n \n\n   \n  The day Idaho’s Medical Freedom Act was signed, a legislator in Louisiana brought forward  the Louisiana Medical Freedom Act . In a hearing later, she pointed to Idaho as a model.\n \n\n   \n  Louisiana followed Idaho once before in 2024, when it  passed a law  that requires schools to describe the exemptions available to parents whenever they communicate about immunizations. Idaho had passed an almost identical law three years earlier.\n \n\n   \n  Herricks, the Louisiana pro-vaccine advocate, said she watched the Idaho Medical Freedom Act’s progress with “a lot of concern, seeing how much progress it was making.” Now it’s set a precedent, Herricks said.\n \n\n   \n  Holland, the Children’s Health Defense CEO, said she looks forward to Idaho’s approach spreading.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to a September announcement by Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo that he intends to rid his state of all vaccine mandates. Holland said she expects other Republican-controlled states to take a serious look at the Idaho law. (Ladapo’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big change,” Holland said. “It’s not just related to vaccines. It’s a blow against the notion that there can be compulsory medicine.”\n \n\n   \n  Some people support the  more-than-century-old notion  that compelling people to be vaccinated or masked will provide such enormous collective benefits that it outweighs any inconvenience or small incursion on personal liberty.\n \n\n   \n  Others, like Holland and Manookian, do not.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of laws like Idaho’s is a sense of, “‘I’m going to do what I want to do for myself, and I don’t want anybody telling me what to do,’ which is in direct contrast to public health,” said Paul Offit, pediatrician and vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n \n\n   \n  Offit, who co-invented a vaccine against rotavirus, is a critic of Kennedy and was removed from a federal vaccine panel in September.\n \n\n   \n  A more fundamental conflict is that some people believe vaccines and other tools to prevent the spread of illness, like masks, are harmful. That belief is at odds with the overwhelming consensus of scientists and health experts, including Kennedy’s own  Department of Health and Human Services  and the  CDC .\n \n\n   \n  Both tensions are at play in Idaho.\n \n\n   \n  As is the case nationally, Idaho’s “health freedom” movement has long pushed back against being labeled “anti-vaccine.” Idaho lawmakers and advocates have stressed that their goals are bodily autonomy and informed choice.\n \n\n   \n  They do not take a stance on the bodily autonomy principle when it comes to abortion, however. Almost all state legislators who voted for the Idaho Medical Freedom Act also voted to ban abortion, if they were in office at both times.\n \n\n   \n  “Every action has to be evaluated on its individual morality,” not on whether it does the most good for the most people, Manookian said.\n \n\n   \n  But Manookian’s rejection of vaccine mandates goes beyond a libertarian philosophy.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian has said publicly that she thinks vaccines are “poison for profit,” that continuing to let daycares require vaccination would “put our children on the chopping block,” that measles is “positive for the body,” that the virus protects against cancer, and that it can send people “into total remission” — an assertion she made on an Idaho wellness center’s podcast in April.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian told ProPublica she believes infectious diseases have been made “the bogeyman.”\n \n\n   \n  Against those claims, research has shown that having the measles  suppresses immunity to other diseases , a phenomenon dubbed  “immune amnesia”  that can make children who have recovered from measles  more susceptible to pneumonia and other bacterial and viral infections . About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected will die from complications of the disease,  according to the CDC .\n \n\n   \n  And while researchers have studied using engineered measles viruses in a cancer treatment,  those same researchers have written that  they were “dismayed to learn” their research has been misconstrued by some who oppose vaccination. They said they “very strongly advise” giving children the measles vaccine, that there “is no evidence that measles infection can protect against cancer” and that measles is “a dangerous pathogen, not suitable for use as a cancer therapy.”\n \n\n   \n  (Manookian said she believes she has evidence for her cancer remission claim but couldn’t readily produce it, adding that she may have been mistaken.)\n \n\n   \n  The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, meanwhile, is safe and highly effective, according to  the American Academy of Pediatrics ,  the Infectious Diseases Society of America  and  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , among others. The CDC says the  most common negative reactions  are a sore arm, fever or mild rash. Two doses of the vaccine provide near total protection, according to the CDC.\n \n\n   \n  Manookian said she doesn’t believe the research on vaccines has been adequate.\n \n\n   \n  She will have another chance to spread her views from a prominent platform in November, when she’s scheduled to speak at the  Children’s Health Defense 2025 conference  in Austin, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  She’ll share the stage with celebrities in the anti-vaccine movement: Del Bigtree, communications director for Kennedy’s past presidential campaign; actor Russell Brand; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson; and Ladapo, the Florida surgeon general who made headlines for his push to end vaccine mandates in Florida, months after Idaho wrote that concept into law.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/melania-trump-east-wing-first-ladies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Melania Trump Has Been Silent on Demolition of the East Wing, Home to First Ladies for Decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump has remained silent on the demolition of the East Wing of the White House, a historic office space used by first ladies since Rosalynn Carter’s time in the 1970s.

Asked if the first lady is supportive of the project, her office would not say.\n \n\n   \n  Melania Trump has spent minimal time in the East Wing — which has long served as the entry point for grand White House events like state dinners and receptions — during her husband’s second term in office,  eschewing the nation’s capital  for New York and Palm Beach, where she spends the vast majority of her time.\n \n\n   \n  In Washington, she employs  a skeletal staff  compared to the first term — with just five full-time staff members as of July — but those staffers have relocated during the construction to other office space on White House grounds, according to a White House official.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the First Lady and the social office —   which oversees major events at the White House — are now inside the executive mansion, split between the Vermeil Room, the South Mezzanine, the Library and the China Room. Other departments that had office space in the East Wing have been moved to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, including the White House Military Office, the calligraphers, the White House Visitors Office, and the Office of Legislative Affairs, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not responded to CNN’s inquiry as to whether plans for the ballroom construction will include permanent replacement office space for the first lady’s staff.\n \n\n   \n  But the scope of the renovations — and the lack of messaging from Melania Trump’s office — underscores the first lady’s changed role in Washington, which is a departure from her tenure during the first term and that of former first ladies.\n \n\n   \n  In her husband’s first term, Trump was an active steward of White House preservation. She helped oversee the  restoration  of the Bellangé suite of furniture in the Blue Room. She replaced the rug in the Diplomatic Reception Room. She was  involved  in a 2020 redesign of the White House Rose Garden – an effort to improve drainage and audio-visual equipment that drew  criticism  at the time. And shortly after the 2020 election, she unveiled a new White House tennis pavilion, which subsequently  won  multiple architectural awards.\n \n\n   \n  This time around, her husband has spearheaded major projects – and she has declined to weigh in publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “Watching the demolition is the physical embodiment of watching the first lady’s role become smaller and smaller,” said Kate Andersen Brower, author of “First Women,” a book exploring the power and role of modern first ladies.\n \n\n   \n  Brower added: “She’s making it clear that – like her husband – she’s not going to be like any other first lady. … She doesn’t care about historic precedent, either.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing was first constructed in 1902 and the structure was reimagined during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Rosalynn Carter became the first first lady to use the East Wing as her office in 1977.\n \n\n   \n  “Since Monday, I have heard from alumni of the East Wing from multiple administrations who are understandably stunned by the images. First ladies’ staff lived and witnessed history within those walls and nothing can take away the memories of working in that extraordinarily special place of purpose and service,” said Anita McBride, who worked in the East Wing as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush.\n \n\n   \n  And the lack of engagement on the issue from the current first lady has surprised observers.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be like — you’re really close to your next door neighbor, but they decided to demolish your garage for a basketball court, and you didn’t really say anything about it,” said Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist who chronicled the Trump family and wrote the book “Free, Melania.”\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for America’s living former first ladies — Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden — did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on their reaction to the demolition.\n \n\n   \n  But Clinton  weighed  in on social media Tuesday, linking to reports of the demolition: “It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/americas/caribbean-strike-survivor-ecuador-drug-smuggling-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila Survived US Military Boat Strike, Family Says He’s a Fisherman, Not a Criminal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, a 41-year-old Ecuadorian fisherman with a prior US drug conviction, survived a US military strike in the Caribbean targeting a vessel allegedly carrying drugs.

Despite a drug record, his family says he’s a fisherman caught in Trump’s war at sea \n       \n  By David Culver, Abel Alvarado, Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The last time Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila’s sister heard from   him was about a year ago when he told her he was heading out to fish for work, she said. Last week, she was shocked to learn that her brother was aboard an alleged drug vessel that was struck by the US military.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila, 41, was one of two people who survived last week’s  strike  in the Caribbean, which President Donald Trump said was carried out against a “drug-carrying submarine” navigating toward the United States. Two others were killed.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila and the other survivor were later returned by the US to their countries of origin, Trump said, describing them as “terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  “No, no … He’s not. He’s not a criminal,” Tufiño Chila’s sister, who asked for her name to not be published out of fear for her safety, told CNN from a small coastal town two hours from the Ecuadorian port city of Guayaquil.\n \n\n   \n  She claims to know nothing of her brother’s alleged involvement with drug trafficking and instead portrayed him as a desperate father trying to provide for his six kids. Tufiño Chila’s wife left him and took the children, but he still sent them money, his sister said.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s very happy, fun,” she said of her brother. “He’s everything I loved most.”\n \n\n   \n  She still hasn’t heard from her brother since he was released by Ecuadorian authorities this week after returning home.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s Attorney General’s Office said Monday that authorities have no information that Tufiño Chila committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. But he has a criminal record in the US: Court documents show that he was arrested, convicted and jailed in 2020 for smuggling drugs off Mexico’s coast before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila’s sister said two other brothers were arrested months earlier, also on drug smuggling charges. Both are in custody: one is in the US, the other is in Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n    Pacific transit route\n \n\n   \n  The family’s   experience illustrates how Ecuador has become a critical route in the cocaine trade. About 70% of the world’s cocaine supply passes from Colombia and Peru through its shores, Ecuador’s president says.\n \n\n   \n  Drug runners often transport narcotics through a large stretch of water on the Pacific Ocean and drop them off in Mexico, where they’re subsequently smuggled  into the US  or Europe.\n \n\n   \n  The drug trafficking trade is hard to escape in Tufiño Chila’s town, according to those who live there.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is complicated. It’s hard,” one man tells CNN of fishermen’s financial struggles, where monthly wages can be as little as $100.\n \n\n   \n  Becoming a drug runner is an enticing prospect when one can make tens of thousands of dollars up front, according to another fisherman who spoke to CNN in March from  Manta , an Ecuadorian city on the Pacific coast.\n \n\n   \n  The profession has also found itself at the crosshairs of the Trump administration. On Tuesday, the  US expanded  its military campaign of attacking boats it suspected of illegal drug running, hitting a vessel in the eastern Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  Both people on board were killed, according to US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  It was the eighth known strike by the US military on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the start of September. All seven previous strikes had targeted boats in the Caribbean Sea, just north of Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  To date, at least 34 people have been killed in the US strikes – 32 of them in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration says they’re about saving American lives from drug overdoses. But most US overdose deaths aren’t from cocaine. They’re from  fentanyl , largely produced in Mexico and smuggled over the border by land, often by US citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As the US strikes continue, the ones caught in the crossfire are rarely cartel leaders, but the men who  take the risk for them . They’re fishermen often seen as expendable by the gangs that hire them.\n \n\n   \n  Tufiño Chila’s sister showed CNN around the house where they lived before her brother went away. His room is kept like a shrine, with a lit candle to honor him and his clothes folded neatly on his bed.\n \n\n   \n  She hopes to speak with her brother soon. For now, she takes comfort in knowing he’s alive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/cycling-emma-pooley-eating-disorders-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-04:00","title":"Former Cyclist Emma Pooley Speaks Out Against 'Unscientific Bullying' Around Food in Cycling","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former professional cyclist Emma Pooley shares her personal experience with disordered eating and the long-term physical and mental consequences of under-fueling during her racing career.

Emma Pooley witnessed ‘unscientific bullying’ around food amid the sport’s high prevalence of eating disorders \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Emma Pooley may have retired from professional  cycling  around a decade ago, but she believes that the effects of under-fueling – what she describes as her “weird” relationship with food – are still with her.\n \n\n   \n  Those scars, Pooley says, are “permanent” and include having a bone density which is “10 to 20 years older than I actually am.”\n \n\n   \n  When it comes to eating, the British former cyclist has found her mindset to be complicated and often contradictory. Pooley has always loved food, recently publishing a  cookbook  with some of her best and favorite recipes; but she also recognizes how her cycling career made her develop worrying and unhealthy habits.\n \n\n   \n  “I sort of thought I shouldn’t eat as much, and it took a while to get through that and to realize that, actually, the more I ate, the faster I was,” Pooley tells CNN Sports. “And I didn’t put on weight because I was training lots.”\n \n\n   \n  For most of her racing career, Pooley says that she believed she was fat, restricting her diet and avoiding certain foods when her body was craving them the most. It’s an approach that was born out of seeing “really, really skinny people” around her in the peloton, as well as the false assumption that being lighter makes you a faster and better cyclist.\n \n\n   \n  The effects of under-eating for professional athletes, Pooley has discovered, can be dangerous and long-lasting.\n \n\n   \n  “With women, if you’re underweight for a long time, you end up messing your hormones around and (can develop) low bone density,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  “My bone density is lower than it should be, and I keep getting stress fractures. I run lots now – that’s my main sport and I still race competitively. In the last seven years, I’ve had a stress fracture in my femur and a stress fracture in my foot. I don’t know if they’re directly caused by years of under-fueling, but it certainly wouldn’t have helped.”\n \n\n   \n   Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport  (REDs) occurs when an athlete of any gender has overtrained and/or under-eaten for a prolonged period in an attempt to improve their performance, often without knowing the dangers of failing to compensate for the energy they expend in training and racing.\n \n\n   \n  Poor bone health is just one knock-on effect. Medical experts say that REDs can damage an athlete’s metabolism, their immune system, their cardiovascular health, their menstrual cycle, and their mental health, as well as their athletic performance.\n \n\n   \n  The condition isn’t limited to cycling, but under-eating has become a flashpoint in the sport in recent years. A  scoping review  published in December 2022 found that competitive cycling has “a high prevalence of disordered eating and/or eating disorders,” while several athletes have spoken openly about their troubled relationships with food.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview  with Cycling Weekly last year, Slovenian Jan Tratnik said that his desperation to lose weight led him to develop bulimia – binge-eating large amounts of food and purging it to avoid weight gain.\n \n\n   \n  “I couldn’t handle being starving, so I cracked and ate too much,” Tratnik said. “Being afraid to gain weight, it was a circle I couldn’t escape from.”\n \n\n   \n  Cédrine Kerbaol, a professional cyclist and nutritionist,  said  during this year’s Tour de France Femmes that the sport is at a “dangerous time” when it comes to thinness and weight loss.\n \n\n   \n  “These recent years, it has been very fashionable to count every gram on our plates,” she told French newspaper L’Humanité. “We must not fall into a form of dehumanization and infantilization.”\n \n\n   \n  Former Tour de France champion and five-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins, meanwhile,  said  in 2019 that “the focus on being light as a rider … can lead to depression, it can lead to things worse than that.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a combination of factors which make elite cyclists more susceptible to eating disorders and disordered eating, including riders not wanting to show weakness and facing pressure from coaches and team managers.\n \n\n   \n  Pooley, who was crowned world time trial champion in 2010 and won an Olympic silver medal in 2008, has first-hand exposure to what she calls “unscientific kind of bullying” around food from team officials.\n \n\n   \n  She points to one instance when, after winning a race in Montreal, she was reprimanded for ordering a hot chocolate.\n \n\n   \n  “What I did experience was teams with directors who watched what you ate,” says Pooley. “So with no kind of measure and no science behind it, they just kind of watched you balefully and got cross with you if you ate the wrong thing.\n \n\n   \n  “Back when I was racing, certainly from some team directors, they seem to think that enjoying food was in some way wrong because food is just a tool,” she adds. “It’s just fuel, and you shouldn’t enjoy it. If you enjoy food, you’ll get fat. And that is so wrong. I really think that enjoying food is an important part of a healthy diet.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Jack Hardwicke, a social scientist at Nottingham Trent University in England, the notion that cycling is a “weight-sensitive sport” is “very engrained from the elite level down,” often triggering patterns of unhealthy behaviors in riders.\n \n\n   \n  That is even filtered through the language used by those in management positions.\n \n\n   \n  “Coaches have a responsibility that when they’re coaching, what are they focusing on?” Hardwicke tells CNN Sports. “How are they talking about weight? How are they talking about body image? How are they helping athletes develop a healthy relationship between their sport, their health and performance, and what’s the balance?”\n \n\n   \n  In elite cycling, Hardwicke adds, “team managers might not see their athletes as humans all the time – they see them as people that they need to perform for the team to survive.”\n \n\n   \n  For riders, the toll of under-eating is not just on their bodies, but also on their mental wellbeing.\n \n\n   \n  “When you speak to people that have suffered with eating disorders and disordered eating, the mental battle is really the biggest part,” says Hardwicke. “It’s very closely aligned with things like body image issues, self-confidence issues … I think that’s where the real issue is.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN Sports, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling’s global governing body, referred to a previous  statement  on REDs syndrome, which said: “The UCI’s role is to raise awareness of the health risks associated with uncontrolled weight loss, and to support doctors with resources to facilitate their work in clinical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “For this, the UCI is in the process of finalising documentation and tools that can be used by team doctors to enable the diagnosis of REDs. The strategy is to rely on a screening and risk-assessment tool validated and published by an International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus group.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Pooley, she admits that cycling has “changed a lot” since she initially retired in 2014, with the most successful teams “encouraging riders to eat better and eat more.”\n \n\n   \n  Today, she firmly believes that food and sport form a natural partnership – “the more you train, the more you have to eat,” adds Pooley – and has made strong, mental connections between moments in her cycling career and things she ate at the time.\n \n\n   \n  That affiliation is partly why the 43-year-old decided to publish “Oat to Joy,” which is part recipe book inspired by the humbleness and versatility of oats, part autobiography chronicling food-based memories from her cycling career.\n \n\n   \n  “I can exactly remember the pizza at the end of the Giro (d’Italia) in 2011 after I didn’t win,” says Pooley. “Certainly, with races, I can remember the special food that we had the dinner after. I’m just really good at remembering what I ate.”\n \n\n   \n  Her competitive cycling days behind her, Pooley has now returned to her first love: running. She competes in trail events, twice finishing 11th in world championship races, and usually only cycles for fun.\n \n\n   \n  And whenever she is tempted to head out on her bike, Pooley will always be sure to make “even more cafe stops than before” – a luxury her professional career didn’t always afford.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/atlanta-airport-threat-safety-security","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Apparent Thwarted Attack at World’s Busiest Airport Highlights Ongoing Security Risks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparent thwarted attack at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport — the world’s busiest airport — occurred when a man named Billy Joe Cagle, armed with an AR-15 rifle and over 20 rounds, was stopped by police after a family alerted authorities that he was on his way to the airport to shoot it up.

She approached the 350-pound man who towered over her and arrested him – thwarting what police said was a planned attack at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, police said.\n \n\n   \n  Banks on  Monday apprehended Billy Joe Cagle , whose family alerted law enforcement that   ﻿he was armed and headed to the airport   to “shoot it up,” police said.\n \n\n   \n  The quick and thoughtful actions of the suspect’s family and authorities were lauded by experts and officials alike. Still, the incident highlights vulnerabilities in airport security, especially in crowded areas not overseen by TSA officers.\n \n\n   \n  Cagle is facing charges of terroristic threats, criminal attempt to commit aggravated assaults, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n \n\n   \n  He was also charged with several federal counts: attempted violence at an international airport, interstate communications containing threats to injure and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia  said on Tuesday .\n \n\n   \n  Cagle is from Cartersville, about an hour away from Atlanta, and a family member then drove to the police department and alerted authorities that he was armed and on his way to the airport.\n \n\n   \n  After receiving a description of Cagle and his vehicle, Atlanta Police   Sgt. Tywana Jones communicated the   details to the team at the airport.\n \n\n   \n  Inside his vehicle parked in the departure area of the airport, police found an “AR-15 assault rifle” and a magazine with more than two dozen rounds, police said.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart was beating fast. I’m like, OK, I haven’t heard any gunshots, anything go off. So, you know, we’re good right now. Let’s just get that information out to prevent that,” said Jones, who is six months away from retiring from the Atlanta Police Department with 30 years under her belt.\n \n\n   \n  “The tragedies that we’ve seen play out across our nation didn’t happen here,” Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n   With more than 108 million people flying through in 2024 , Hartsfield-Jackson is the world’s busiest airport.\n \n\n   \n    Airport public areas remain vulnerable\n \n\n   \n  “Public areas of airports are still vulnerable; they’re still at risk. And if someone is looking for large groups of people, ticket counters, the lobby areas, the garages, the bag claims, they are not defended by the TSA,” said Mary Schiavo, CNN transportation analyst and former inspector general for the US Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  Enhanced security, like vehicle inspections, were in place after September 11, Schiavo said. Those strict security measures slowed down traffic and travelers and likely would not be welcome again.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody liked it, but it certainly added security,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the measures could be reinstated if similar incidents like the Atlanta case occur again.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavo praised the suspect’s family for coming forward and preventing a potentially significant   attack.\n \n\n   \n  “They not only saved innocent travelers’ lives, they most likely saved their relative’s life because he would have been gunned down,” she said. “There’s lots of cameras and security at the airport that could have responded very quickly. He wouldn’t have made it out. So the family obviously really did a life-saving measure.”\n \n\n   \n  Heightened security could have made a difference in an attack playing out, too, Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  “Checking the cars and checking the bags, the physical security, is what would have made a difference here, if the horrible thing had unfolded … thank God the family called in time.”\n \n\n   \n    Barriers could help\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s apparent thwarted attack will be studied by airport personnel as a success story, according to Keith Jeffries, a former federal security director at Los Angeles International Airport, who spoke to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The communication capability from family to law enforcement and how quick they reacted, that’s tremendous,” Jeffries said. “The fact that the Atlanta Police Department, airport police, responded like they did, that was an exceptional work, to put it mildly”.\n \n\n   \n  However, having cars idle outside terminals or leaving a car behind, such as what happened during Monday’s incident, does present a security risk, Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  Having barriers, even decorative ones, just outside airport doors could help with that, Jeffries added.\n \n\n   \n  “Anytime there’s a large crowd, if someone has bad intentions and wants to make whatever statement or use violence against crowds, that’s a relatively simple thing to do where there’s a crowded area,” Jeffries said. “Putting those barriers in place will help those vehicles from driving straight into an airport, into a crowd … It serves as a bollard to prevent vehicles from pulling up in there.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries, who now serves as the vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, indicated that new technologies might not be the answer to bolster security at airports, unless there’s a machine that can read people’s minds. “That, to my knowledge, doesn’t exist,” he noted.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes all you need is more boots on the ground, like around major travel holidays, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Having a good overt presence, everyone staying alert, being on the lookout. And I think what this is going to do as we approach an even busier season, as Thanksgiving gets closer, I think this message is going to spread like wildfire to all the airports of the value of good communication,” Jeffries said. “This is going to be a great case study for airports to coordinate with the Atlanta Airport on something that went extremely well. Too many times are we studying things that went horribly wrong and learning from that.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s also imperative for travelers to stay alert, calm and vigilant . \n \n\n   \n  “You also need to calm down, pause, and be very aware of your entire domain awareness, what’s going on around you, because at any given point in time, an emergency can occur of some sort, and always just be prepared,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/trump-universities-compact-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-04:00","title":"Seven Universities Reject White House Funding Deal with Attached Demands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A White House proposal offering expanded federal research funding to universities in exchange for ideological policy changes—such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions and capping international student enrollment—has been met with strong resistance from multiple institutions.

Other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the University of Arizona declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and seven schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter addressed to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, University of Arizona President Suresh Garimella said, “We seek no special treatment and believe in our ability to compete for federally funded research strictly on merit.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Arizona’s refusal comes after the University of Virginia rejected the offer after a meeting at the White House on Friday. UVA has since reached a separate agreement with the administration aimed at ending federal investigations into admissions practices and civil rights.\n \n\n   \n  The Universities of Southern California and Pennsylvania, Brown University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Vanderbilt University and the University of Texas at Austin have said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an  unprecedented level of control over universities  – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, the   University of Kansas and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with those of Vanderbilt, Dartmouth, Texas at Austin, Arizona and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements. Harvard University is the only university to take on the White House directly in court, and while the school has had some judicial victories, the Trump administration continues to seek new and creative ways to apply pressure to the school.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  In declining the offer, University of Arizona President Garimella said, “We have much common ground with the ideas your administration is advancing on changes that would benefit American higher education and our nation at large.” But, “a federal research funding system based on anything other than merit would weaken the world’s preeminent engine for innovation, advancement of technology, and solutions to many of our nation’s most profound challenges.”\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College declined the offer Saturday morning. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock maintained the school needs to set its own policies according to its mission and values, she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a compact—with any administration—is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves, and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas,” Beilock said.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  last week, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, the school reached  a separate agreement  with the Trump administration. ﻿UVA agreed to a Justice Department mandate that it end what the Trump administration cast as unlawful racial discrimination in its programming, admissions and hiring.\n \n\n   \n  Importantly, the deal does not include a monetary settlement, and UVA will not have an outside monitor overseeing compliance. In return, the Trump administration will pause ongoing investigations into UVA on admissions practices and civil rights.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education on Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Education Secretary McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n  Vanderbilt University Chancellor Daniel Diermeier rejected reports that the Nashville university had been asked to accept or reject the compact. “We have been asked to provide feedback and comments as part of an ongoing dialogue, and that is our intention,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that “academic freedom, free expression and independence are essential for universities to make their vital and singular contributions to society.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. Officials didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/03/11/business/campus-union-organizing-dartmouth-basketball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-10:23","title":"Dartmouth basketball’s union vote is just a small part of the campus organizing wave","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the growing trend of student unionization in U.S. college campuses, with a central focus on the historic union vote by the Dartmouth men’s basketball team — the first college athletes to do so.

\nUpdated: \n        11:24 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If you want to find the most new union members, don’t go to a  Starbucks  or an  Amazon warehouse , despite the high profile organizing wins unions have achieved with those employers in recent years. Head to college and university campuses.\n \n\n   \n  The Dartmouth College men’s basketball team achieved a significant milestone last week when they became the first college athletes to vote to join a union. But they are only a small part of a much larger trend – that of   college and graduate students voting in big numbers to join unions in their on-campus jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Organizing vote wins in higher education have added more new union members than in any other sector of the economy in recent years, said Christian Sweeney, deputy organizing director at the AFL-CIO.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been happening for a while,” he said. “It’s young people saying we’ve got to protect our interests here. It’s really very much grassroots driven.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union representation votes for private sector employers such as Dartmouth, reports 38 separate elections in just the last two years, including the Dartmouth basketball vote, bringing 41,500 student employees into various unions. And that doesn’t include additional students at state schools who are joining unions, but operate under a different labor law.\n \n\n   \n  For example, student assistants at the California State University system voted overwhelmingly to join a union last month, bringing 20,000 into the CSU Employees Union. National totals for those state school union gains are not available, however.\n \n\n   \n  And similar to the 13-2 margin vote in favor of the union at the Dartmouth basketball team last week, the unions are winning these votes overwhelmingly. Overall 90% of the students voting in the NLRB representation elections voted in favor of the unions.\n \n\n   \n    Other union wins at Dartmouth\n \n\n   \n  The Dartmouth basketball vote might never have happened if not for another recent union win at the school, an organizing win by the Student Workers Collective at Dartmouth, which organized 173 students working in food service jobs on campus by winning a vote 52-0 in April of 2022.\n \n\n   \n  It won its first union contract, including big pay raises, about a year later after the newly-formed union voted to authorize a strike. Starting pay, which had been $13 an hour, jumped to $21. More-veteran workers are making between $26 or $28.\n \n\n   \n  “Our entire unit was ready to strike. We let them know it would happen,” said a Dartmouth junior and a leader of the union who asked that her name not be used. “In 24 hours [Dartmouth administration] scheduled a meeting with us and accepted all our demands.”\n \n\n   \n  She said while getting more money was helping students, some workers used the higher pay to work fewer hours.\n \n\n   \n  “Especially at Dartmouth every hour here is precious,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  One of those workers impressed by the pay raise was Cade Haskins, a junior majoring in politics, philosophy and economics who, in addition to his job at a campus snack bar, is a forward on the basketball team.\n \n\n   \n  He started talking to his teammates about how the basketball players, who do not receive a scholarship, should form a union as well. He eventually became one of the leaders of the effort.\n \n\n   \n  The other leader of the union effort has been team captain Romeo Myrthil, who came to Dartmouth from Sweden. He was surprised to find how few Americans belong to unions compared to his homeland, one of the most heavily unionized countries in the world.\n \n\n   \n  “There are many things about America that are tough to adjust to,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Organizing athletes still uphill battle\n \n\n   \n  The vote last week by the Dartmouth basketball team rightly got a lot of attention as the first group of college athletes to vote to join a union. But the union efforts for the team aren’t yet over. Dartmouth basketball players don’t get a scholarship, and the college has announced it will seek to overturn the union vote, arguing that they are not employees.\n \n\n   \n  “We have productive relationships with so many unions. We believe our athletes are students,” Dartmouth President Sian Beilock told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an  interview last month . “We don’t give athletic scholarships. We are student-athletes here, and we believe our students should be thought of in that way.”\n \n\n   \n  But the NLRB regional director ruled that because Dartmouth “has the right to control the work performed by the Dartmouth men’s basketball team, and the players perform that work in exchange for compensation,” they could be considered employees. That compensation includes “room and board for part of the year, equipment, apparel, tickets to both home and road games, footwear, access to nutrition and medical professionals, exclusive use of certain facilities, and academic support.”\n \n\n   \n  Haskins and Myrthil said they’re not expecting big dollars for playing basketball. Dartmouth testified that the team only brings in revenue of $458,000 a year.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to have a voice at the table is what’s important to us,” Haskins said.\n \n\n   \n  Haskins, who’s from Minneapolis, said his grandmother is the only member of his family that has been in a union before, and only briefly just before she retired.\n \n\n   \n  “Initially my mom was telling me, ‘Don’t do it, don’t get kicked off the team,’” he recalled when he told his parents about his union efforts. But he said they eventually came around and supported him.\n \n\n   \n  Some Dartmouth alumni at a recent game   also had mixed feelings about the union effort. At a recent Dartmouth road game at Columbia University, Douglas Murphy, Dartmouth class of ’78 and a former basketball player at the school, said he was happy to see the union effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I take my hat off to them,” said Murphy, who was a union member himself for 36 years as a state employee in New York. “I wish we had a union when I was playing. We had some big problems with staff when I was playing. We needed it.”\n \n\n   \n  One section away in the Columbia bleachers, Ed Burns, Dartmouth class of 1985, said he’s worried about what unionization would mean to schools that aren’t in big dollar athletic conferences, such as the Ivy League where Dartmouth plays.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not talking about Michigan football or Alabama football,” he said, referring to two of the most profitable college sports teams. “Will the Ivy League schools get together and say, ‘We’ll just offer club sports?’ I hope not, but that could be the long-term implications of this.”\n \n\n   \n  Burns, who has worked in management and never been in a union in his career, said he’s a sports fan and doesn’t object to professional sports unions that have helped athletes to earn millions.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re probably good for sports,” he said. “They were probably inevitable.”\n \n\n   \n    Will union effort spread to other teams?\n \n\n   \n  Haskins and Myrthil said they hope the victory of the union vote at Dartmouth will spark union votes on many other teams, including the big dollar programs. It will be an uphill fight, especially at many major sports programs that are most often found at state schools, not private schools, and are under different labor laws that can make organizing more difficult, depending on the state.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA has long sought to prohibit students from receiving any compensation for athletics, other than scholarships and some modest stipend money. But the Supreme Court opened the door for  greater compensation  for student athletes in 2021 when it ruled unanimously that NCAA rules prohibiting compensation to student athletes violated antitrust laws. The ruling opened the door for college athletes at the big money sports to start getting money from use of their  name, image and likeness , or NIL, in endorsement deals. But proposals to  allow direct pay  from the schools has yet to be approved by the NCAA.\n \n\n   \n  And the idea of union representation for college athletes was endorsed by a coach at least one major sports powerhouse. In a press conference soon after winning the college football championship, then-University of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said it was time for athletes to get a share of the wealth being produced by college sports, and that unions would be the way for that to happen. Michigan reported football revenue of $131 million in the most recent year to the Department of education.\n \n\n   \n  “And it’s long past time to let the student-athletes share in the ever-increasing revenues. I mean, it’s billions,” said Harbaugh, who has since taken a coaching position in the NFL. “And there needs to be a voice for the young people, the student-athletes. Right now, there is no voice… I have nothing against unions. That’s the next step, fellas. I think that’s the way you’ve got to go. That’s what I’d like to see change in college athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  But in all these cases, both in sports and with   campus jobs outside of sports, the students being asked to join a union movement are only going to be around for a limited number of years.\n \n\n   \n    Clock ticking on campus union fights\n \n\n   \n  An organizing drive can take a year, and a first contract can take longer than that. It’s not like trying to organize workers at a factory where the staff could be looking at long-term careers and expect to benefit from any contract that is reached.\n \n\n   \n  Another recently organized student union at Dartmouth is still seeking its first contract. The Graduate Organized Laborers of Dartmouth represents graduate teaching and research assistants. It is affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, one of the non-academic unions that has been very active in organizing in higher education.\n \n\n   \n  Logan Mann, a third-year graduate engineering student who is on GOLD-UE’s bargaining committee, said the initial organizing effort for the union started in fall of 2021, and that while it would have liked to have reached a contract already, they went into the effort knowing it could be a long fight.\n \n\n   \n  But that they had no choice, given their working reality, Mann said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re surrounded by so much wealth and don’t have any of it ourselves,” he said. “There’s a crushing cost of living and rent increases with no pay increases in sight.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though many union supporters will be graduating and leaving the school soon, he said the union is there for however long the fight for a contract takes.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an interesting challenge,” he said. “We have 25% turnover every year. The turnover, along with the fact that everyone will leave eventually means that our primary mission is one, to get a contract, and two is to develop future leaders in the union.”\n \n\n   \n   Update: This story was updated in October 2025, after one of the students interviewed in the story asked that her name be removed for personal reasons. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/americas/maduro-trump-venezuela-military-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-04:00","title":"Maduro boasts of ‘thousands’ of Russian anti-aircraft missiles as Trump threatens military action inside Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro claims Venezuela has 5,000 Russian-made Igla-S anti-aircraft missiles deployed across the country, including remote areas, as a defensive measure amid rising tensions with the United States.

air defense positions,” its President Nicolás Maduro claimed on Wednesday, amid growing tension over the United States’ military deployment in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has said he is weighing military action inside Venezuela as part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign and a broader effort to weaken Maduro, a longtime foe of Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “Any military force in the world knows the power of the Igla-S and Venezuela has no less than 5,000” of them, Maduro said during an event with military personnel broadcast by Venezolana de Televisión (VTV).\n \n\n   \n  The Russian Igla-S missiles are short-range, low-altitude systems similar to American Stingers. They can shoot down small aerial targets such as cruise missiles and drones, as well as helicopters and low-flying planes.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro said the missiles, light enough to be carried by a single soldier, had been deployed “even in the last mountain, the last town, and the last city of the territory.”\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed 4,500 Marines and sailors to the Caribbean to strengthen operations against cartels and demonstrate military power. It has carried out several lethal strikes on boats  off the Caribbean  coast that it alleges were trafficking narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers from both parties in the US have questioned the legality of the strikes on the alleged “narco boats.”\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Trump said he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the US was considering expanding its military campaign to land, as part of an intensifying US pressure campaign that officials say is aimed at ousting Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months, by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has been responding by repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia members and denouncing US activity in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The people of Venezuela are “clear, united, and aware,” Maduro said in a televised speech last week.\n \n\n   \n  “They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   \n  According to  Rosoboronexport , the Russian state company that exports Igla-S systems, they have a range of up to 6,000 meters and can reach targets at a maximum altitude of 3,500 meters.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of Igla-S missiles cited by Maduro, but they were known to be part of Venezuela’s arsenal, according to the military balance compiled by the  International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). \n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, has been photographed several times with the launchers in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has contacted Venezuela’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"White House releases list of donors for Trump’s multi-million-dollar ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House has released a list of donors supporting President Donald Trump’s proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which is framed as privately funded and not taxpayer-funded.

companies and calls on Moscow to agree to immediate ceasefire \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, Kit Maher, Kaitlan Collins, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:41 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies as it called on Moscow to agree to an immediate ceasefire in  the war with Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump had for weeks signaled he could impose penalties against Russia for its continuation of the war but had failed to take major punitive measures until Wednesday. The announcement came as Trump said he had “canceled” an anticipated meeting with Putin because he “didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get.”\n \n\n   \n  In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump explained he “felt it was time” for the sanctions, noting he “waited a long time” to impose them. Still, the US president said he hopes “they won’t be on for long” because the war will end.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement Wednesday that it was “the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire.”\n \n\n   \n  “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent added: “Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions hit Rosneft and Lukoil and almost three dozen of their subsidiaries. The United Kingdom targeted the two oil companies last week, and the European Union formally adopted another package of sanctions, includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports, on Thursday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The EU’s sanctions envoy David O’Sullivan will meet with top Treasury Department official John Hurley on Thursday, a Treasury spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna praised Wednesday’s announcement, which she said “comes after numerous attempts to give Russia a chance to begin real negotiations to end the war.”\n \n\n   \n  “The decision is fully aligned with Ukraine’s consistent position: peace is possible only through strength and pressure on the aggressor using all available international tools,” Stefanishyna said in  a post on X , adding that she also expects “strong decisions from European partners tomorrow, following the meeting of the European Council.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine had been calling for increased pressure on Moscow as the war has raged on. Diplomatic efforts to end the war have stalled and Russia has rejected the notion of freezing the conflict for negotiations – something that Ukraine and Europe have said they support.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said last week that he intended to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. However, Trump said on Wednesday he had “canceled” that anticipated summit, telling reporters, “It just didn’t feel right to me,” although he said they would meet in the future.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier this week  that Trump’s hopes for a quick meeting with Putin had stalled out , with an administration official saying Tuesday there were “no plans” for a summit between the two “in the immediate future.”\n \n\n   \n  The impact of the new US sanctions will be greatly determined by how they are implemented and whether the administration pushes ahead with secondary sanctions, one expert told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “So far what’s come out is these primary sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, but the key then will be if there’s a threat of secondary sanctions on banks, oil refineries and traders in third countries who are dealing with Rosneft and Lukoil,” said Eddie Fishman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the Biden administration announced sanctions on other  top Russian oil companies , but held off on targeting Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  Officials argued at the time that they waited until the waning days of the administration to impose the sanctions in part because of the state of the global oil market and the potential impact on the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously wavered on imposing further sanctions on Russia.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at the G7 in June why not impose sanctions, Trump said, “When I sanction a country, it costs the US a tremendous amount of money,” adding, “Sanctions are not easy. It is not just a one-way street.”\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement came hours after Russia launched a  large-scale air attack  on Ukraine, including Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Wednesday, Bessent previewed the new sanctions as “one of the largest,” noting  Trump’s disappointment  with Putin and the state of talks to end the war in Ukraine, following a  summit in Alaska  more than two months ago.\n \n\n   \n  “President Putin has not come to the table in an honest, forthright manner as we hoped. There were talks in Alaska; President Trump walked away when he realized that things were not moving forward,” Bessent told Fox Business. “There have been behind-the-scenes talks, but I believe that the president is disappointed at … where we are in these talks.”\n \n\n   \n  “These are sanctions, not secondary tariffs,” Bessent added. “These are going to be substantial and powerful, and we are urging our European and G7 allies plus Canada and Australia to come along with us.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/ukraine-sweden-gripen-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00-04:00","title":"Ukraine Could Get 150 Advanced Swedish Fighter Jets Under Just-Signed Deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine has signed a letter of understanding with Sweden to receive up to 150 advanced Saab Gripen-E fighter jets, marking the first major offer from a NATO member to supply significant numbers of fighter jets to Ukraine.

Swedish fighter jets under just-signed deal \n       \n  By Brad Lendon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:49 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New NATO member Sweden has said it is willing to sell Ukraine up to 150 of its most advanced fighter jets, the first offer from a member of the alliance to supply significant numbers of jets to Kyiv, which is seeking to upgrade its small and ageing air force.\n \n\n   \n  The deal signed on Wednesday by Volodymyr Zelensky and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson is a letter of understanding, meaning exact terms, costs and delivery dates for 100 to 150 Saab Gripen-E jets are yet to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  But both leaders said it has the potential to be a game changer, not only for Ukraine –   which desperately needs more air combat capabilities in its fight against Russia – but for NATO and European security overall.\n \n\n   \n  “We are opening an entirely new and truly meaningful chapter in our relations — relations between Ukraine and Sweden, and more broadly, overall security relations in Europe,” Zelensky in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “These are very cool planes, powerful aviation platforms that allow for performing a wide range of tasks,” Zelensky said.\n \n\n   \n  “This will strengthen both Ukraine, Sweden and Europe,” Kristersson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Sweden joined NATO in 2024 along with its Nordic neighbor Finland. Their accession to the alliance – which ended longstanding policies of non-alignment – was spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Fighter jets have been a critical need for Ukraine since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of its neighbor. At the time, Ukraine’s air force consisted largely of Soviet-era aircraft. While Western countries have come to Kyiv’s aid with older US-made F-16 models as well as a handful of French Mirages, those have not been enough to counter Russian air superiority.\n \n\n   \n  But the Gripen-E is considered by experts to be well-suited to operating conditions in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Gripen fighters have the reputation of being relatively cheap and easy to maintain and arm, and able to operate in austere conditions – using roads or even dirt roads for runways.\n \n\n   \n  While the first version of the jet dates to the late 1980s, the E model just entered service with the Swedish Air Force earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Gripen-E models have so many upgrades that they are “in many respects a new aircraft type,” with new radar and communication systems, better sensors and the ability to deploy new weapons, the Swedish Armed Forces said in a release at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Manufacturer Saab calls the single-engine Gripen-E “the game changer” with the ability to network sensors and coordinate missile launches among the fleet. At the same time, the jets have embedded AI capability, Saab says.\n \n\n   \n  Each jet has 10 “hard points” to attach missiles that can strike other air and ground targets.\n \n\n   \n  The Gripen-E will be familiar to pilots who have flown earlier models, it said.\n \n\n   \n  That could become important as Ukrainian pilots have tested and trained on older Gripen jets and simulators, the communications chief for Ukraine’s air force said Wednesday in  a report from RBC-Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  With that training, some observers have raised the possibility of Ukraine getting older Gripen models to tide them over until the E models arrive in about three years.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Zelensky told a press conference in Sweden that he hoped his country could receive and start using the Gripens next year.\n \n\n   \n  “For our army, Gripens are a priority,” he said,  according to Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  If the deal is completed with 150 jets eventually going to Ukraine, Kyiv could become the top operator of the Gripen-E worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  Besides Sweden, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand fly Gripens.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement came just days after Zelensky’s attempt to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles to use in strikes deep into Russia was rebuffed by US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Wednesday that one of the reasons he denied Zelensky’s request is that Tomahawks require a long training period.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with the Tomahawk that a lot of people don’t know, it’ll take a minimum of six months, usually a year, to learn how to use them. They’re highly complex,” Trump said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/france-louvre-director-heist-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"03:42:00-20:00","title":"No security cameras covered Louvre balcony where thieves entered, director says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A high-profile heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, occurred on Sunday, October 1, 2025, when thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery via an unmonitored eastern balcony.

Nicholls, and Hilary Whiteman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:42 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  No security cameras were monitoring the second-floor balcony where thieves gained access to the Louvre to steal historic  jewels worth over $100 million , the museum’s director told a French Senate committee hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Laurence des Cars told senators Wednesday that the eastern balcony of the Apollo Gallery, where  robbers broke into the building on Sunday  using an angle grinder, was not covered by the museum’s aging camera system.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, on the Apollo Gallery side, the only camera installed faces west and therefore does not cover the balcony affected by the break-in,” des Cars told the hearing, as French investigators raced to recover the stolen jewels.\n \n\n   \n  Four days after the heist, investigators are yet to publicly identify any suspects as experts warned the  jewels were likely to be dismantled for their raw materials , destroying artifacts dating back to the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  The ease with which thieves gained access to the building – during opening hours via a truck-mounted ladder – has shocked the nation and raised questions about the vulnerability of the country’s museums to criminals deploying new tactics.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars told the hearing that the “absolutely obsolete, even absent, technical infrastructure” to monitor the country’s most valuable treasures was a “terrible observation” for the world’s largest museum. She said she’d offered her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati after the robbery, but it was rejected.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars, who took the role in 2021, said the museum’s weakness lies in the lack of perimeter protection, which she said was a result of “chronic underinvestment in equipment and infrastructure.”\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre’s last major renovation was in the 1980s under former French President François Mitterrand, who commissioned Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei to design an entrance befitting the historic venue.\n \n\n   \n  The glass pyramid that now forms the entrance to the museum opened to the public in 1989, putting a modern face on a storied institution known for its exhibition of the world’s finest art.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars said that renovation project may have created an illusion of momentum behind the museum being fully modernized. However, she said: “This major modernization project is now 40 years old, with facilities that have outperformed and are at the end of their tether.”\n \n\n   \n    How it happened\n \n\n   \n  The heist unfolded at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday when robbers parked a truck with a mobile ladder outside the gallery. At 9:34 a.m. they triggered an alarm on the second-floor door, which sent a signal to a security post.\n \n\n   \n  A security officer inside the auditorium radioed to report an intrusion and staff began evacuating members of the public. Alarms on two high-security display cases were triggered as the thieves cut holes in the glass to grab the jewels.  At 9:36 a.m. police were called. A minute later, a message was broadcast requesting that the doors be closed. By 9.38 a.m. the thieves had left the building.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance teams outside the museum prevented the suspects from setting their vehicle alight but could not prevent their escape on scooters along the banks of the Seine. A law enforcement official said investigators combed the truck for any traces of DNA. One of the two scooters had been retrieved as well as a helmet worn by one of the suspects, the official added.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars said Wednesday the security system inside the Apollo Gallery “worked perfectly” – but that it was designed several years ago to protect against the greatest risks of that time. For example, the high-security display cases that housed the jewels were designed to withstand bullets.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, this was the dominant modus operandi for this type of attack, for precious objects, jewelry, attacks in jewelry stores,” des Cars said. “That’s what the Louvre is protecting itself against.”\n \n\n   \n  She said what’s needed now is to adapt the system to a  “new type of attack, to new operating methods that had not been envisaged.” \n \n\n   \n  The theft had “profoundly shocked” the museum’s staff, French citizens and “all those who love the Louvre,” des Cars said.\n \n\n   \n  She suggested measures that could be put in place to enhance the museum’s security, such as fortifying the outer edges of the Louvre and prohibiting cars from parking in the vicinity.  Des Cars said she’s also considering whether it would be possible to install a police station inside the museum.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/us-military-strike-pacific-8th","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"23:46:00-04:00","title":"US military strikes 2 boats in Pacific in apparent expansion of campaign against alleged drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted two lethal strikes in the Eastern Pacific, killing all people on board two suspected drug-smuggling vessels operated by 'Designated Terrorist Organizations.'

against two boats in the eastern Pacific this week, killing all people on board each vessel, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The two strikes on vessels in the Pacific — the eighth and ninth known strikes by the US military on alleged drug-smuggling vessels since the start of September — appear to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, with all seven previous strikes targeting boats in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  At least 37 people in total have been killed in the nine strikes, officials have said.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said on X Wednesday, noting a Tuesday strike in the Pacific had killed both people on board.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said the boat in that strike was “being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific” and “was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route, and carrying narcotics.”\n \n\n   \n  Later Wednesday, Hegseth said the US conducted a lethal strike on a second suspected drug boat in the eastern Pacific, killing all three people on board.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO),” Hegseth wrote in  the post. \n \n\n   \n  The secretary added that no US forces were hurt in the two Pacific strikes and compared the traffickers to al Qaeda.\n \n\n   \n  “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people. There will be no refuge or forgiveness—only justice,” he wrote in his first post.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants who can be summarily killed without any kind of judicial review.\n \n\n   \n  The US struck at least two other vessels last week in the Caribbean, one of which did not kill everyone on board. Rather than hold  two survivors detained by the US Navy  after one of those strikes, the US  repatriated the survivors  back to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  The situation was potentially going to set up a legal and policy dilemma for the administration because it was unclear what legal authority the US military would be able to cite to detain them indefinitely.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/middleeast/analysis-trump-bibisitting-netanyahu-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s babysitting of Netanyahu puts the US in charge on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant shift from traditional diplomacy, the United States, under the Trump administration, has taken an active and hands-on role in managing the implementation of a Gaza ceasefire agreement with Israel.

Meanwhile, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff have conducted multiple missions to Israel, shaping and forging the agreement into a diplomatic reality.\n \n\n   \n  High-level American visits to Israel during times of crisis are not unprecedented – President Joe Biden rushed to Tel Aviv days after October 7, 2023, in a powerful solidarity visit, warning Israel’s enemies not to get involved, with his Secretary of State Antony Blinken following multiple times. But those visits were more about solidarity and deterrence; Trump’s are about management and compliance. This United States is not merely mediating the Gaza ceasefire – it is actively managing it.\n \n\n   \n  “We intend to stay engaged every single day to make sure peace takes hold,” Vance said at a news conference on Tuesday, unveiling a new US coordination center to monitor and assess real-time developments of the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n \n\n   \n  “The event is being managed by an external entity, by the Americans, and this is a very problematic matter,” former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen Gadi Eisenkot told Israel’s Kan Radio on Tuesday. “As we progress with the agreement, more international forces will enter, and this will limit the IDF.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington’s micromanagement of the deal’s implementation underscores its determination for the ceasefire to succeed. The Trump administration is spending an incredible amount of political capital to force the ceasefire to survive its first few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  But it also reflects concern about the intent of Netanyahu’s political partners. His far-right allies have opposed an end to the war and called for a complete occupation of Gaza. Netanyahu was able to get the first phase of the deal through, including the return of the hostages in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n \n\n   \n  The second phase is far more challenging: defining post-war governance and security forces in Gaza, as well as establishing what roles the Palestinian Authority, Arab states and other international stakeholders will play.\n \n\n   \n  The fragility of the truce was exposed earlier this week, after a military clash in Rafah in which two Israeli soldiers were killed. Jerusalem was quick to declare this a ceasefire violation. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich tweeted one word: “War.” Israel carried out strikes across Gaza that killed more than 40 Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday afternoon, Netanyahu announced a suspension of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. But he reversed course two hours later under American pressure, according to an Israeli source with knowledge of the matter. Three days later, Vance said there would be “inevitable skirmishes,” but that the ceasefire would last.\n \n\n   \n  The post‑war phase also marks a recalibration of regional roles. Despite deep Israeli skepticism, Turkey and Qatar are central to Washington’s framework for reconstruction and mediation in Gaza. Vance stated pointedly in Jerusalem that “what troops are on the ground in Israel – or Gaza – is for Israelis to approve,” even as he praised Ankara and Doha for their “constructive” influence.\n \n\n   \n  “The rules of the game are being written while we speak, but it’s already clear that the US is calling the shots and Israel is playing by its rules,” Amos Harel, Haaretz’s senior military analyst, told CNN. “Netanyahu will never admit it, but to a large extent, Israel mortgaged some of its independence, with US generals controlling the wheel.”\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military is accustomed to incredibly close cooperation with the US, which has been on full display repeatedly throughout the war. But Harel says this is more than cooperation – it is management. “The Israeli military leadership does not necessarily like to have another authority hovering over their head,” he told CNN. But the military, whose chief of staff pushed to accept an earlier ceasefire, understands it’s the only way to end the war.\n \n\n   \n  “The US track, even if it’s full of holes, is the way to get there,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This dynamic is reflected in the Trump administration’s repeated interventions in Israel’s strategic decisions over the past several months. In June, Trump ordered the Israeli Air Force to recall jets en route to a strike on Iranian targets. In September, he forced an apology to Qatar after a failed strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Days later, he publicly instructed Israel to halt aerial operations in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  For some Israeli observers and politicians, the magnitude of American involvement could entrench the perception that Israel is dependent on US permission, eroding its sovereignty and freedom to apply force. “Netanyahu has single-handedly turned us into a protectorate, which accepts dictates regarding its security,” opposition leader Yair Lapid charged on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu rejected the criticism. Standing alongside Vance in Jerusalem on Wednesday, he said the idea that Israel is an American client state is “hogwash.”\n \n\n   \n  “One week they say Israel controls the US, a week later they say the US controls Israel,” he said sarcastically. Vance echoed his position, saying, “We don’t want a vassal state, and that’s not what Israel is. We don’t want a client state and that’s not what Israel is. We want a partnership, we want an ally here.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Trump and Netanyahu have repeatedly declared they intend to push the Middle East beyond conflict management toward a renewed Abraham Accords expansion. It is the carrot that Trump has dangled in front of Netanyahu, and the White House is trying its best to will it into existence.\n \n\n   \n  But the main Israeli political barrier persists: how to reconcile the demand for a viable pathway for Palestinian statehood with Netanyahu’s hardline coalition. Here, the American babysitting might play to Netanyahu’s advantage – Trump’s pressure can provide him with domestic political cover and an excuse for concessions his coalition would never otherwise accept.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-potential-230-million-doj-payment-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:34:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s potential $230 million DOJ payment would be astonishing — even for him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the reported claim by former President Donald Trump that the Department of Justice (DOJ) wrongfully investigated him during his first term, resulting in a $230 million demand for damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

astonishing — even for him \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:34 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The idea of a president convincing his own Justice Department to furnish him with nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in taxpayer cash seems too absurd to take seriously.\n \n\n   \n  Putting aside unfathomable ethical implications, such a move would be one of the most glaring examples of a political tin ear in modern times, as many Americans struggle to pay rent or buy groceries.\n \n\n   \n  For this reason, there must be a good chance that  Donald Trump’s reported claims for damages  over the DOJ’s past investigations into his conduct is a step too far even for him.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has often fashioned a new normality with his outlandish moves. His life in business and politics has been one long and lucrative attempt to apply leverage for personal or financial gain and to sate his thirst for payback. In an inverted political world, where he’s destroyed curbs that constrain presidents and turned the DOJ into a boutique personal law firm, the notion of a bumper personal payout cannot be immediately dismissed as a fantasy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump declined the chance to do so himself in the Oval Office Tuesday after  the New York Times  reported on the claims. While he initially seemed hazy on details of the two claims, he didn’t rule anything out,  saying they “could be”  something he’d pursue.\n \n\n   \n  And in his unique way, in which he sometimes seems more like a commentator on his own presidency than its perpetrator, he put his finger on what makes this situation so bizarre — without apparently computing why people are worried about the idea. “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself,” the president mused before his political antennae kicked in and he pledged to donate any money he might get to charity.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has often described himself as the nation’s top legal officer, he wouldn’t in theory have the final say on the matter. That would fall to officials including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. But since Blanche is Trump’s former personal lawyer, that distinction may not matter very much.\n \n\n   \n  A full 24 hours after the Times story broke, there was still no full on-the-record denial from the White House. The complaints were filed as an administrative claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act — a first step to see whether a settlement is possible before someone can sue for damages. The Times reported Trump was seeking $230 million in total compensation in claims filed before his reelection over alleged rights violations in the Russia investigation during his first term and the probe into his alleged hoarding of classified documents.  CNN previously reported on that claim , which sought $100 million. Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump or his 2016 campaign conspired with Russia. The classified documents case was dropped when Trump won the 2024 election on the grounds that presidents cannot be prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n    One word that rarely worries the White House: ethics\n \n\n   \n  Trump would face multiple political and ethical hurdles if he decided to push his claims to a conclusion. The role of Blanche — who acted for the president and presumably billed him for his services in the classified documents case — is only one of the concerns.\n \n\n   \n  To begin with, the symbolism of a billionaire president lining his pockets with taxpayer money would be jarring, especially when  the government is shut down , thousands of essential workers are showing up without pay and  nutrition benefits for needy Americans  are in danger of running out.\n \n\n   \n  “Particularly right now, we’re talking about a quarter of a billion dollars transferring, maybe, to the president when we’re in a shutdown posture, so it’s at very best bad timing, but I think it’s horrible optics,” said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who is more prone to speaking out than many of his Trump-fearing colleagues since he’s not seeking reelection.\n \n\n   \n  Even a Democratic Party that has struggled to pin down Trump with an effective counteroffensive could surely make hay with such a spectacle, especially amid a shutdown they triggered  over high health care costs . Trump would risk a voter backlash in testing economic times. A CBS News poll earlier this month found that the economy, jobs and inflation were top concerns. Some 75% thought Trump wasn’t focusing enough on the price of goods and services at a time when he’s threatening to send troops into US cities, conducting  lethal strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats  on the oceans, and pursuing personal vanity  architectural projects .\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump has never shown great concern about reaching beyond his political base. And many of his voters share his view that he was persecuted by the Justice Department, despite substantial evidence of wrongdoing — which the president denied — and two grand jury indictments. He’s often proved he’s got more leeway than many pundits think.\n \n\n   \n  “Taxpayers pay for a lot of things … about $2 trillion more than they should every year,” Trump loyalist and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Wednesday. “But I hope they work it out. And I know the president is just trying to put pressure on the DOJ, to say, ‘Listen, this was wrongly done.’”\n \n\n   \n    An increasingly profligate administration\n \n\n   \n  Any decision to pay Trump would underscore the president’s felling of the traditional wall between the White House and Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Normally, the officials involved might be expected to recuse themselves. But the fate of Jeff Sessions, the Trump first-term attorney general who recused himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation — and bought himself  a ticket out of the administration  — offers a cautionary tale. And can there be any expectation that Blanche or Attorney General Pam Bondi would risk their jobs to defy Trump after multiple examples of Justice Department obedience to a president who is using the  machinery of government  to pursue his  political enemies ?\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s one more example where Donald Trump is using the Justice Department as his private playground, trying to fleece his pockets,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday. “He’s just going to just see if his puppets that he put in that Justice Department are going to perform for him … he doesn’t think they should conflict themselves out. Perhaps they will. But he deliberately put his personal lawyers in there.”\n \n\n   \n  If Trump did snag a big payout from the DOJ, he’d exacerbate criticisms that he’s using his post to  boost his personal and familial wealth , despite his past vows to “drain the swamp.” Democrats have complained that Trump and his clan made hundreds of millions of dollars in a  cryptocurrency boom  unleashed by his government’s friendly policies toward the industry. The US has meanwhile taken delivery of  a jumbo jet from Qatar  that he plans to use for his new Air Force One and that raised massive ethics concerns, given the Gulf nation’s role in US foreign policy. And first lady Melania Trump will feature in a  big-budget Amazon documentary .\n \n\n   \n  A DOJ award to the president would be the latest example of an administration increasingly willing to throw huge amounts of money at its pet projects while slashing government programs.  The Washington Post reported  last week that the Coast Guard plans to spend an estimated total of $200 million on two private jets to be used by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top officials. And Trump is planning a  $20 billion bailout of Argentina , conditional on voters supporting his populist friend and MAGA hero President Javier Milei.\n \n\n   \n  A huge Justice Department payout to Trump might top all that. But surely, given all the political liabilities and ethical nightmares, he wouldn’t go ahead.\n \n\n   \n  Or would he? Before this week, no one can have imagined that the wrecking-ball president would have demolished a beloved part of the White House, without consulting the people, the true owners of the home where he’s just a temporary resident.\n \n\n   \n  But the historic ghosts of elegant quarters once graced by Jacqueline Kennedy now lay buried in the  rubble of the East Wing , before Trump’s vast new ballroom rises — a kind of Mar-a-Lago on the Potomac.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/asia/south-korea-president-lee-jae-myung-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-04:00","title":"South Korea’s President Downplays US Trade Rift and Welcomes Trump as ‘Peacemaker’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung downplayed recent U.S. trade tensions and welcomed incoming U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential 'peacemaker' in efforts to facilitate dialogue between the United States and North Korea.

downplays US trade rift and welcomes Trump as ‘peacemaker’ \n       \n  By Will Ripley, Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae, Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:05 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   South Korea’s  President Lee Jae Myung   hailed his nation’s relationship with the United States in a CNN interview on Wednesday, pushing aside lingering trade concerns and welcoming US President Donald Trump ,  who is about to visit Asia, as a “peacemaker.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee acknowledged tensions in the Korean Peninsula had “gotten worse” in recent years,   speaking several hours after North Korea  test fired ballistic missiles  in its first such military show of force   since he took office in June.\n \n\n   \n  But he played down the risk, reiterating the need to pursue peace and dialogue – and raised the possibility of Trump bridging the gap between the two Koreas.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope that (Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un) will be able to engage in dialogue,” he said. “I also believe that President Trump wants to achieve world peace, and that is why I have made the recommendation for him to take on the role of a peacemaker.”\n \n\n   \n  While the chances that  Trump will meet Kim  during his multi-stop visit to Asia later this month remain low, Lee said it would be “a good thing” if the “leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump met Kim  several times during his first term , holding landmark summits that ultimately failed to produce a meaningful breakthrough. But earlier this summer in a White House meeting with Lee, the US president said he was  willing to meet Kim again .\n \n\n   \n  Trump is also expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping next week when South Korea hosts the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit  in Gyeongju, attended by leaders and delegations from across the region.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said as recently as Friday that he intends to meet Xi on the sidelines of the key summit, though it’s not clear where or when this will happen. Tensions remain high between  the two rival powers , after another trade spat and slew of tariff threats.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea has always walked a fine line in navigating its relationships with the US and China. Seoul and Washington have been staunch allies for more than seven decades – drawing closer in recent years in a joint effort to combat growing Chinese influence in the Asia-Pacific region. South Korea is also home to the US military’s largest overseas base, which houses 41,000 people including troops and their families.\n \n\n   \n  But South Korea and China have also maintained a strong trading relationship.\n \n\n   \n  “We have different ideologies and also a different system of government … (but) we cannot shut out China,” Lee said, adding that the “vital” US alliance made managing the China relationship “a bit delicate.”\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to relationships between countries, you cannot cut it clean with a knife and say: ‘This country is our friend, and this country is not.’ It’s just not that simple – it’s much more complicated and complex,” said Lee.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambitions and growing capabilities in high-tech industries present a challenge to South Korea, long seen as a global leader in such critical sectors.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that Chinese companies were catching up with (and in some cases overtaking) South Korean ones, Lee said there remained “many areas where Korean firms can win,” such as semiconductors and automobiles.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea is   committed to sharing this expertise with the US too, Lee said, emphasizing their bilateral relationship included economic, technological, and military cooperation.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past we have received a lot of assistance from the United States, and so we are willing to provide assistance for the US’ efforts to  revamp its manufacturing industry  to the extent possible,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  His tone was notably warm, despite the US-South Korea relationship being strained in recent months by Trump’s immigration crackdown. Nearly  500 people , mostly Korean nationals, were arrested and detained during an ICE raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia last month, sparking outrage back home. The car maker is one of South Korea’s largest companies.\n \n\n   \n  After the detainees were flown back to South Korea, Trump posted online that he didn’t want to “frighten off or disincentivize investment into America by outside countries or companies.”\n \n\n   \n  South Korea has also had to contend with Trump’s tariff demands, which came as the country was dealing with the fallout from Lee’s predecessor  briefly declaring martial law , then cycling through a revolving door of interim leaders as the economy spluttered.\n \n\n   \n  In late July, barely a month into his tenure, Lee  negotiated a trade deal  with the Trump administration to avert high tariffs on Korean exports, including a $350 billion investment flow from South Korea to the US. But detailed negotiations have dragged out, leaving the country’s key auto making industry at a disadvantage – subject to 25% US tariffs while its rivals in Japan and Europe have already secured much lower rates.\n \n\n   \n  Lee acknowledged there are “differences in opinion” between South Korea and the US in the ongoing talks, but said he believed “that eventually we will get there because the United States is the leading country when it comes to the values of democracy and the free market system.”\n \n\n   \n  Some critics have slammed Trump’s tariff demands as extortionate – especially for longtime allies and friends like South Korea. When asked what he thought of this, Lee simply laughed.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that we will, in the end, be able to reach a rational result that can be acceptable,” he said, smiling.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94389","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:15.423Z","title":"Government Announces New Immigration Policy to Address Asylum Seeker Surge","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government has announced a new immigration policy aimed at managing the increasing number of asylum seekers.

Here's what that means in your community \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:24 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's Day 23 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it. Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid tomorrow, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. The Senate on Thursday  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal workers. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but  the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.   The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . Read the latest on a case brought by some federal employee unions to stop the latest wave of layoffs during the shutdown. As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down?   A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer.  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.  In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.  Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.   Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR Will active duty military receive their next paycheck?    The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members , according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month., but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.  Some workers are fighting back in court ; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees. Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order    What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? Tens of millions of people are at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November. That includes 7 million for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and nearly 42 million who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will  run out of money Nov. 1 . In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift  money from its contingency fund and other places  to keep SNAP at least partially funded. Meanwhile, WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration  shifted $300 million in tariff revenue  to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's  calling for an additional $300 million  to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some  states  could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR And what about school lunches? Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals. Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown. \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\" According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.  —  Kadin Mills,  NPR USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.  —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler ,  NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Monday, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.  According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\"  Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.  At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.  This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.  In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support   WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.  Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue.  But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.  In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late.  Read more on  how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown  from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, also according to a post last week  from Noem , from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country .  Air traffic controllers  helped to end the last government shutdown , and could help end this one as well. A \"slight increase\" in  sick leave at two facilities  on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos. Read more on  what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown  from NPR's Joel Rose. The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region. Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country: Alaska The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [ Alaska Public Media ] About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's  threat that federal employees could receive termination notices  increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected.

[ KJZZ ] California Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh,  according to state data . [ LAist ] The shutdown of the federal government  has brought  the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites  across California:  Muir Woods is fully closed . Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they  didn't learn the plan  until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down.  Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors . [ KQED ] Colorado Sites and lands in Colorado  operated by the National Park Service are open , but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website.

[ Colorado Public Radio ] Coloradans: Been impacted by the federal government shutdown?  Colorado Public Radio wants to hear from you. Connecticut Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont  said on Wednesday . But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [ WSHU ] Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are  asking Lamont to consider using it  to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [ WSHU ] Georgia For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance,  Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said.  The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [ GPB ] Georgia farmers could also face delays in  block grant funding and commodity data  they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [ NPR ] Hawaii University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees  out of pocket during shutdown . Over 830 University of Hawaiʻi employees are at least partially paid through federal dollars, with thousands more in positions that are fully federally funded.

[ KCUR ] For more on the impact in Kansas City,  head to KCUR . Kentucky Funding for food assistance benefits next month isn't coming, Gov. Andy Beshear said, due to the federal government shutdown. Funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program is also delayed. [ LPM ] Louisiana The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely.  It covers nearly half a million Louisianans.  Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [ WWNO/WRKF ] For more on the impact in Louisiana,  head to WWNO/WRKF.

[ OPB ] Pennsylvania Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown  may be eligible for unemployment  compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [ WITF ] Tennessee On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [ WLPN ] Texas U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at  the 32 other official ports of entry  are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [ Houston Public Media ] Utah In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly.

Jeff Merkley delivers 3rd longest Senate floor speech in modern history to protest Trump \n       \n  By Morgan Rimmer, Ted  Barrett and Rashard Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:38 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley now holds the record for third longest Senate floor speech in modern history, after delivering remarks for more than 22 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Merkley began speaking on the Senate floor after announcing he would protest what he called  President Donald Trump ’s “grave threats to democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We’re in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” the Oregon Democrat, who turns 69 on Friday, said after kicking off his remarks at 6:24 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  In total, the senator spoke for 22 hours and 36 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after his remarks came to an end, Merkley told CNN’s Manu Raju that he almost fainted at one point and noted that he had been dehydrating himself since Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “It is about dehydration. My last sip of anything — well, I might have had a micro-sip – was breakfast on Monday morning on the plane. That was my last food too. And I wasn’t really sure that was going to work out, and I said, ‘I hope I’m not fasting for no reason.’ I love to eat,” said Merkley, later adding that he had a slice of pizza just off the floor.\n \n\n   \n  He said “there was one moment” where he thought he might faint, and noted that he had injured his back while running a few weeks ago. “My back hurt the whole damn time,” said Merkley.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about gallery staff and Capitol Police, who are working without pay during the shutdown, being forced to work through the night during his speech, Merkley said it was “outrageous” that there are no negotiations happening to end the shutdown, and noted, “having this speech tonight or not having this tonight isn’t going to speed up paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added that after he finished speaking, “I went around and thanked everybody who had been on the floor, including the pages, including the floor staff, including everybody, because I do realize it was such an imposition.” He said that he also thanked the Republicans in the chair for presiding over his speech.\n \n\n   \n   Senate rules do not permit lawmakers to take bathroom breaks or sit down without yielding their time – though there was a short interruption Wednesday at noon for the daily prayer and pledge before the senator began speaking again.\n \n\n   \n  Merkley’s marathon speech stands as a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as his party remains in a standoff with Republicans over health care subsidies amid the government shutdown. The shutdown is expected to drag on with the impasse entering a fourth week Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have so far held their position, blocking the GOP stopgap bill to reopen the government 12 times until their demands are met.\n \n\n   \n  The senator in his speech pointed to the Trump administration’s previous  halting of research grants  for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the  recent indictments  of several of the president’s political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there’s a rebellion. And if there’s a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Early Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  His comments on the situation in Oregon come after  an appeals court  on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court’s permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Democratic  Sen. Cory Booker  of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, warning against the harms he said the administration was inflicting on the American public. The effort broke the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  This was also not Merkley’s first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017  against Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court .\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris  Murphy  on gun control in 2016;  Rand Paul  over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and  Ted Cruz  against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This headline and story have been updated to reflect the record held by Sen. Jeff Merkley. He delivered the third longest floor remarks in modern Senate history. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/ncaa-college-athletes-pro-sports-betting","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-04:00","title":"NCAA Allows College Athletes to Bet on Professional Sports Starting November 1","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA has approved a rule change allowing college athletes and athletic department staff to place bets on professional sports, effective November 1, 2025.

control exercise,” Putin said in a video conference with the top military brass.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s Ministry of Defense said the drills involved all three components of the nuclear triad: land, sea and air.\n \n\n   \n   Videos shared by the state-owned military TV channel Zvezda showed the launch of a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia’s north and a

said.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin said the drills tested the readiness of military command-and-control systems and the operational skills of the staff, adding that all objectives were met.\n \n\n   \n  Russia holds routine readiness exercises as part of its nuclear deterrent. During a similar exercise last October, Putin said Russia’s nuclear arsenal “enables us to achieve strategic deterrence objectives and uphold nuclear parity and the balance of power globally.”\n \n\n   \n  The following month, Putin  updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine , two days after then-President Joe Biden  gave Ukraine approval  to strike targets deep inside Russia with American-made weapons.\n \n\n   \n  In comments on Wednesday, Russia’s deputy foreign minister mentioned the  New START treaty , an agreement that came into force in 2011, in which the US and Russia pledged to limit their arsenals of nuclear arms.\n \n\n   \n  Under the treaty, both countries had seven years to meet defined limits on the number of deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons they can have. It is due to expire in February 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “If the US rejects the New START proposal, there will be a total vacuum in the area of nuclear weapons limitations and a growing nuclear threat,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, according to state media RIA Novosti.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia must be convinced of the US administration’s sustainability in abandoning its hostile course,” the outlet cited Ryabkov as saying.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian comments on the US come as plans for a meeting between Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump have stalled, with  multiple officials telling CNN  that an expected diplomatic engagement in Budapest, Hungary is no longer happening — at least for the time being.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Tuesday he didn’t want the meeting to be “a waste of time.” He may still meet with the Russian leader, he implied, but he indicated it was no longer a top priority.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian drills also come just over a week after NATO held its own nuclear deterrence exercise called  Steadfast Noon .\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the alliance said that the drill was “not linked to any current world events.”\n \n\n   \n  Around 70 aircraft from 14 allied nations took part in the exercise, the statement said, operating out of airbases in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Denmark.\n \n\n   \n  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that the exercise was carried out “because it helps us make sure that our nuclear deterrent remains as credible, safe, secure, and effective as possible.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/east-room-demolition-white-house-ballroom","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"19:03:00Z","title":"Trump plows past concerns over East Wing demolition — and envisions an even bigger ballroom than initially planned","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is proceeding with the demolition of the White House East Wing to construct a larger, $300 million ballroom, bypassing required approvals from the National Capital Planning Commission.

The president has shown visitors two flat tabletop models, at times quizzing the room on which version they preferred: the smaller one or the larger one. Most answered that the bigger one was better, to which Trump agreed.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s not clear how much larger, Trump did say Wednesday that the ballroom is expected to cost a projected $300 million, seemingly in line with a larger structure. Previously, the administration had  put the cost at $200 million .\n \n\n   \n  The project has  drawn outcry  and led to questions about whether the president was within his legal authority to dismantle entire sections of the executive mansion. Not all of Trump’s own team was set on the project at the start, one source familiar with the internal conversations told CNN. At the beginning, some aides and advisers thought it was too big of a task to undertake, and attempted to explain how difficult and lengthy the process was likely to be. But once it became clear the president wasn’t going to give up on the idea — which he’s been musing about for the better part of 15 years — everyone quickly got onboard.\n \n\n   \n  The White House says it will submit plans for the ballroom construction to the National Capital Planning Commission, but insists the body doesn’t have purview over the decision to knock down the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  Some former members of the panel have questioned that assessment. And one of the nation’s premier historic preservation organizations is calling for an immediate halt to the leveling of the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  But there appeared little standing in the way of the president’s decision to move ahead with the audacious, multi-year project. Now  the demolition  is well underway, it seemed unlikely the plans would be reversed.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure,” Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office when questioned about the project. A scale model of the White House grounds — with the ballroom prominently jutting out from the East Colonnade — sat on the table in front of him.\n \n\n   \n  He said after a “tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world,” the determination was made of the East Wing that “really knocking it down” would be necessary.\n \n\n   \n  “It was never thought of as being much,” he said. “It was a very small building.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, track excavators continued their work ripping into the former home of the office of the first lady, the White House calligrapher and some military aides. The demolition was proceeding quickly, with roughly half the structure now reduced to a grey pile of cement and twisted rebar. Staffers in those departments have been relocated to other areas on the complex.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing’s wood-paneled foyer has long been the main point of entry for visitors attending social events at the White House, as well as those going on tours of the building. The section emerged in its current form in 1942.\n \n\n   \n  The rest of the East Wing is likely to be demolished by the end of the week, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways, the cries of disapproval are coming too late. Renderings released by the White House in July showed the ballroom sitting atop where the East Wing used to sit, and an  official press release  at the time stated it would sit “where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said anyone outraged or concerned he was taking steps without being frank about his intentions were misplaced.\n \n\n   \n  “I haven’t been transparent? I’ve shown this to everybody that would listen,” he said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Still, images of the building torn to pieces this week have caused shock, particularly as Trump tests his authority in nearly all aspects of the presidency — not least of which is the building he lives and works in.\n \n\n   \n  The project began ramping up over the summer, one source said, and weekly meetings to discuss the project began. The president himself has been involved in these meetings, which also have included Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, the White House Military Office, the Secret Service, an architecture team and other staffers internally who have been tasked with helping move the project along quickly, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House said in late July that McCrery Architects and its CEO James McCrery would take the lead in the design of the addition. A few days later, McCrery was spotted alongside Trump on the White House roof surveying the area on the South Grounds where the ballroom will go.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s aides were prepared for pushback on the ballroom and sought to review what was legally required to complete the project, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, administration officials determined the White House would only need approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal construction projects in Washington and its neighboring states, Virginia and Maryland. But officials said the commission has jurisdiction only when “vertical” construction begins, and does not oversee demolition.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently  appointed White House staff secretary and loyalist Will Scharf to chair the commission . White House deputy Chief of Staff James Blair and another Trump aide were also appointed to the commission at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  Scharf said during a meeting of the commission last month the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The commission, which is closed amid the ongoing government shutdown, was created by Congress in 1924 and is comprised of 12 members. Three are appointed by the president, along with the chairman, with the rest of the seats reserved for federal agencies, such as the National Park Service, and representatives from the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  Projects reviewed by the NCPC in recent years include changing the perimeter fence around the White House grounds and a tennis pavilion Trump installed during his first term. The fence, in particular, took several years before it was ultimately approved; officials said it was a necessary change because people kept jumping over the previous one and running toward the North Portico.\n \n\n   \n  L. Preston Bryant Jr., who served as chairman of the NCPC for nearly a decade, described a three-stage process that typically unfolds for federal projects, beginning with early consultations that he described as collaborative.\n \n\n   \n  “The Commission staff very much wants a potential project to get started on the right foot. This early consultation stage is very important,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The project goes through subsequent phases — conceptional, preliminary approval and final approval — before the process is complete.\n \n\n   \n  Bryant said he couldn’t remember a time when demolition was separated from the approval process in the way the Trump White House has done.\n \n\n   \n  “That was not my experience during my time at NCPC,” Bryant said. “If there’s to be demolition, that’s part of the project. The demolition element is inherent in the overall project. Demo is not separated from construction. It’s part of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Rebecca Miller, the executive director of the DC Preservation League, said demolishing the East Wing before a formal submission of the ballroom plans essentially starts the project before a formal review process.\n \n\n   \n  “Most concerning is that they’re just tearing down the East Wing without any public submission as to what is going to be built in its place,” she said. “And that’s where the National Capital Planning Commission, or the Commission on Fine Arts, or the public, would have their input into the design of the property, its compatibility with the White House, and how to mitigate or minimize the impact on the current historic resource.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this kind of zone where there’s nothing that prevents the demolition, but we’ve also not seen what the submission is,” Miller added.\n \n\n   \n  Other laws and rules also appear not to apply to the White House. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the  National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 , which details the process by which stakeholders should be brought in for large public projects. But the law excludes the three pillars of US government – the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the White House — from its provisions.\n \n\n   \n  The  Shipstead-Luce Act of 1930  also requires that alterations to buildings in the national capital area, including the White House, must be presented to the Commission of Fine Arts. The language, however, refers to buildings facing the White House and not the White House itself.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the concerns about the new ballroom appear unconvincing. Sitting in the newly gilded Oval Office as the machines were working away outside, he held up a pile of paper renderings showing the plans, including the Louis XIV-style interior that closely resembles the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “You see it goes beautifully with the White House,” Trump proclaimed. “I mean, the mix is beautiful.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/cars/gm-self-driving-tech","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"GM to Introduce 'Eyes-Off' Driving Technology in 2028","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"General Motors, facing financial strain from policy changes and declining EV demand, is launching a bold initiative to offer hands-free, 'eyes-off' driving technology in its Cadillac Escalade IQ SUV starting in 2028.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  General Motors, the 100-year-old car company that has struggled with its expensive modernization efforts, plans to offer Americans hands-free driving and the freedom to watch a movie on the go.\n \n\n   \n  The company unveiled new “eyes-off” driving technology that will be available starting in 2028, part of a new technology initiative revealed by GM executives in New York Wednesday. The automaker said the initiative includes a conversational AI technology that will be introduced into   vehicles next year.\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine you step into your vehicle, you push a button, and it drives you to the office. You catch up on work, send emails, or watch an episode of your favorite show,”   said GM CEO Mary Barra. “The car drops you off … then it goes to get your dry cleaning, take out for dinner, and it comes back in time so you can drive your kids to their soccer game.”\n \n\n   \n  The version of the future imagined and described by Barra is years away, but in three years GM is promising the “eyes-off” driving experience will be available in their Cadillac Escalade IQ SUV.\n \n\n   \n  This year GM will take a $1.6 billion hit to their electric vehicle business because of government policy changes and the termination of consumer EV tax credits. GM has poured tens of billions of dollars into their EV fleets but has struggled attracting like-minded consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “Customers want immersive tech in their vehicles and to stay connected wherever they go. We’re drawing from our rich heritage, our design, our engineering, our manufacturing expertise, and we’re doing something entirely new,” said Barra.\n \n\n   \n  This technology may be new for General Motors, but it’s far from the first car company to release this type of tech. Stellantis, Tesla, and Waymo already have driverless cars on the road. (Stellantis – along with Mercedes and Volkswagen – also have conversational AI capabilities.)\n \n\n   \n  No company has yet achieved wide-scale commercialization of self-driving cars, so GM believes an opportunity for leadership still exists. But it has a tremendous amount of ground to make up.\n \n\n   \n  “When we launch this, we’ll see what happens. We may be the first to have a personally owned self-driving vehicle that works, that’s safe and that’s important. I don’t view it as catchup. I view it as leapfrog,” said Sterling Anderson, Chief Product Officer at GM.\n \n\n   \n  Barra and GM’s President Mark Reuss, who both began their careers at General Motors in the 1980’s, presided over Wednesday’s unveiling. They were joined by Anderson, who started six months ago and previously worked at Tesla, and Dave Richardson, the company’s SVP of Software Engineering, who joined almost two years ago from Apple.\n \n\n   \n  “The juxtaposition on stage is not an accident, (it’s) stark,” Anderson said of his Tesla background.\n \n\n   \n  Both hirings reflect that General Motors – the car company – must be a technology-first company to compete.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just sort of a recognition that the company does need to get more technology forward and focused. But that just takes a little bit of time for people to get on the same page,” Richardson said.\n \n\n   \n  Time is not on GM’s side. Cars from Chinese companies like BYD and Zeekr are rapidly gaining market share in Europe due to their lower prices and technology-forward designs. A 100% US tariff on Chinese cars has kept them out of the US market.\n \n\n   \n  But if that changes, those companies could present a real challenge for GM. But Reuss thinks GMs offerings can compete.\n \n\n   \n   “It’s not going to be taking apart Chinese cars and copying Chinese cars,” said Reuss. ”We went through technology investment and R&D and we’ll continue to do that and we have got to be the best, period. I think that wins with the customer.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5583624","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:29:00-04:00","title":"A slap in the face: Ranchers feel betrayed by Trump's plan to buy Argentine beef","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has proposed increasing beef imports from Argentina to lower U.S. grocery prices amid a surge in domestic beef costs driven by a drought-induced decline in cattle inventory.

face': Ranchers feel betrayed by Trump's plan to buy Argentine beef \n         By Juliana Kim \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 4:29 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         This year, Destinee Weeks and her husband, who manage a herd of about 250 cattle in northern Oklahoma, began to see a profit for the first time in a decade. So Weeks was shocked and dismayed when she learned President Trump was looking to import more beef from another country. \" It feels like a slap in the face to rural America,\" she said. \"It makes you feel invisible and overlooked.\" Beef prices have been  soaring  in the U.S. as a result of a shrunken cattle supply. On Sunday, Trump suggested buying beef from Argentina could be one way to lower costs. It comes as the president already agreed to a  $20 billion currency swap  to boost the South American ally's struggling economy. American cattle ranchers and agricultural groups swiftly opposed the possible deal, arguing that it would hurt ranchers. But Trump defended the move while talking to reporters on Sunday, asserting that \"Argentina is fighting for its life.\" He also claimed on Truth Social that his global tariffs have helped ranchers. \"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" Trump wrote in  his Wednesday post . Despite days of verbal clashes between president and ranchers, the White House on Wednesday confirmed plans to quadruple the tariff-rate quota for beef imports from Argentina. The same day, the Department of Agriculture announced  an action plan  to support domestic cattle ranchers. The United States Cattlemen's Association  said  the USDA's initiative was a positive step forward, but the group was still \"deeply concerned\" about the move to purchase more foreign beef. \"A deal of this magnitude with Argentina would undercut the very foundation of our cattle industry,\" USCA president Justin Tupper said in a statement. Cattle ranchers say it's not their fault that prices are high The U.S. cattle inventory is at its  lowest levels in decades  — a trend driven by drought and rising operation costs, which has forced many ranchers to  shrink their herds . In August, the cost of ground beef per pound was about $6.63 — about two dollars more than it was four years ago, according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics . At the same time, higher prices have offered a path to recovery for some ranchers like Weeks. \"I wanna make it very clear, when we say it's profitable, no one's riding off into the sunset in a yacht,\" she said. \"We're healing up.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Meanwhile, some ranchers argue there's another key player shaping beef prices: the four meatpacking firms that control over 80% of U.S. beef processing. \" The American rancher is not in control of the price of beef in this country,\" said Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle producer and senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan advocacy group. Recently, two of those companies — Tyson Foods and Cargill — agreed to pay a combined $87.5 million to settle  a class-action lawsuit  accusing them of fixing beef prices. It's a big reason why Lovell called the cattle market \"broken.\" \"Importing more beef is not going to fix that problem,\" he said. Some are skeptical that importing Argentine beef will lower prices The U.S. already imports a record amount of beef from other countries, including Argentina, according to David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University. The challenge with relying on foreign meat to bring down prices is that the U.S. is the world's largest consumer of beef. Anderson said it's unlikely that Argentina has nearly enough supply to satisfy America's appetite. \"They just don't have the kind of supplies that they could export to us that would make much of a noticeable impact on U.S. beef prices to consumers,\" he said. Anderson added that ultimately, it will take time for beef prices to stabilize. \"There's no easy solution to bringing down prices — particularly an easy, quick solution,\" he said. The moves comes after a fallout with other farmers  John Boyd Jr., a cattle and crop farmer in Virginia and the founder of the National Black Farmers Association, has already been reeling from Trump's trade war with China, which has caused it to stop buying U.S. soybeans. Now, Boyd is concerned about his cattle business. \"Everything that the president is messing with and interfering with affects my farming operation,\" he said. The USDA on Wednesday responded to the ranchers' concerns by laying out a slew of plans to strengthen the country's beef industry. That includes expanding grazing access and bolstering natural disaster relief. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Still, Boyd said purchasing more meat from Argentina does not sit right with him. \"I'm opposed to Argentina getting anything else from the United States,\" he said. These clashes are particularly notable because farmers and ranchers  are a major voting bloc  for Trump. Weeks, from Oklahoma, said she simply wants the president to stick to his agenda of putting America first. \"I think that we should always choose to support our domestic producers,\" she said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   President Trump is in another clash with American farmers. First, it was over soybeans. Now it's beef. It comes after Trump suggested that buying meat from Argentina would lower grocery store prices here in the U.S. But cattle ranchers in the U.S. say that move would hurt them. NPR's Juliana Kim has been covering all of this and joins us now. Hi, Juliana. JULIANA KIM, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: So tell us what is going on. Like, what's all this beefing about beef (laughter)? KIM: Yeah. So Trump says this is all about lowering beef prices for American consumers. You know, prices have been soaring, and it's because of a decline in the country's cattle inventory. So on Sunday, Trump told reporters that he was considering buying more beef from another country, specifically Argentina. And that really alarmed cattle ranchers. I mean, they say they're just starting to get on their feet after years of drought and expensive operation costs. And the truth is, these higher beef prices have actually offered a pathway to recovery for a lot of these ranchers. CHANG: OK. Well, what has President Trump said in response to those concerns? KIM: Trump's defended the move by saying Argentina needs our help. You know, the country's economy is spiraling, and it's why earlier this month, Trump agreed to essentially loan them $20 billion. Trump also made comments on Truth Social yesterday, saying ranchers don't understand that they're recovering because of his global tariffs. Now, I do want to mention that the president has repeatedly underscored that he cares about ranchers. And yesterday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture did release an action plan to expand America's cattle herds, alongside importing more foreign beef. CHANG: An action plan - well, what about the ranchers? What are they saying about all of this? KIM: Yeah. I spoke to a couple of them this week, and I think Destinee Weeks from rural Oklahoma summed it up best. DESTINEE WEEKS: It feels like a slap in the face to rural America, quite frankly. KIM: She says this year, her family's ranch finally began to generate a modest profit for the first time in a decade. Something else to remember is that all of this beef talk is happening in the backdrop of Trump's trade war with China. And among its effects on the U.S. economy, China's no longer buying U.S. soybeans, which is a big blow to American farmers. CHANG: Exactly. OK, well, Juliana, if the U.S. imported more foreign beef, what impact would that actually have on prices here? KIM: I posed this question to agricultural economist David Anderson from Texas A&MU (ph) University. He's skeptical that importing more beef from Argentina is going to make any difference on grocery store prices. DAVID ANDERSON: They just don't have the kind of supplies that they can export to us that would make much of a noticeable impact. KIM: Anderson says the U.S. is already importing a lot of beef from other countries - Argentina included - and still prices are high. He says it might not be the answer consumers want to hear, but there's just no quick fix. And it's going to take time for ranchers to recover. CHANG: Well, how do you think all of this is going to play out politically for Trump? KIM: I mean, the move has angered some Republican lawmakers, including Senator Pete Ricketts from Nebraska, which is a major beef-producing state. And this is on top of poor approval ratings on the economy. Ranchers and farmers are a key voting bloc for Trump. CHANG: Yeah. KIM: And the sentiment I'm hearing from them is that they just want the president to stick to his agenda of keeping America first, and that includes our beef. CHANG: That is NPR's Juliana Kim. Thank you, Juliana. KIM: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581354","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-04:00","title":"Ongoing shutdown threatens food aid for 42 million people","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An ongoing federal shutdown threatens to end critical food assistance programs, most notably SNAP and WIC, for nearly 42 million Americans.

About 1 in 8 U.S. residents get an average of $187 a month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. One of those people is Shari Jablonowski. The 66-year-old widow, who lives outside Pittsburgh, is bracing to lose the $291 in food aid her disabled nephew gets each month. She raised her now-adult nephew and two nieces as her own, and even without this looming crisis, her budget is a tightrope. \"This month, I could not afford to pay … anything, gas or electric,\" she says. Instead she paid her monthly car payment, since she needs to drive to doctors' appointments, visit her mother, and one niece uses the car to get to work. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If her nephew's food benefit disappears in November? \"I am very concerned I will not have heat,\" she says. It would also ruin Thanksgiving. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the country's largest anti-hunger program. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities,\" Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, says of food stamp recipients. \"If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression.\" For most people, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was dramatically reduced in the 1990s, Berg notes, and Medicaid payments go directly to doctors, hospitals and drug companies.\"The only thing that really helps moderate income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program. And that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month,\" he says. In addition, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents is also at risk of  running out of money . The Trump administration  tapped $300 million in tariff funds  to keep WIC — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — afloat, but it's expected to run out within a few weeks. Some states say they'll  help fill that funding gap , but not all have the resources for that. There's pressure on USDA to keep funding SNAP Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has warned that SNAP funding will run out on Nov. 1, and USDA has told states that payments are on hold \"until further notice.\" The agency blames Democrats, who say they won't vote to end the shutdown unless Republicans agree  to extend tax credits for the Affordable Care Act  to keep health insurance premiums from skyrocketing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a statement to NPR a USDA spokesperson said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\" Undocumented immigrants  are not eligible  for the Affordable Care Act. Food aid advocates say USDA can and should keep funding SNAP. \"SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called  contingency reserves ,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research and policy institute. That wouldn't cover the entire amount, but she says the agency could legally transfer additional funds, as they've done for the WIC nutrition program. In fact, Bergh argues USDA has a legal obligation to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program. Department officials did not respond to an NPR query about whether there is such a legal obligation. The origins of U.S. food benefits go back to the Great Depression. If funding does lapse next month, Bergh says, \"We would be in uncharted territory.\" And for some SNAP recipients it could be double whammy. That's because many will be subject to  new work requirements  tied to the benefit   starting November 1 – the same day their benefits might end. The work requirements, passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this year, are expected to  push 2.4 million people off the program  over the next decade. States and food banks are scrambling to help In a  letter Thursday ,  the U.S. Conference of Mayors also urged USDA not to let SNAP benefits be disrupted, saying the program helps stabilize local economies.Each month, the federal government pays $8 billion in SNAP benefits. The money is automatically added to a debit-like card that recipients can then use at groceries, farmers markets and other places. More than  250,000 food retailers  count on that income, says Berg with Hunger Free America. It's not clear whether the government will act in time to prevent SNAP benefits from ending. And if it does – but waits until the last minute – it would take days to get the benefits distributed to states and then onto people's spending cards. Meanwhile, states are  preparing for a spike  in demand at  food banks . Virginia, for example, declared a  state of emergency  and said it would provide food benefits. Colorado's governor  urged people to donate  to food banks, and California said it would  send National Guard troops  to help out at food banks, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic. But advocates say even expanded food charity will nowhere near make up for the loss of billions in federal funding. Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she'll cope with a major hole in her budget. She already visits food pantries and plans to step that up. But \"there's nothing I can do to make money,\" she says. \"I'm not in the greatest of health.\" For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing some for later. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94658","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:47:00-04:00","title":"Effort to pay at least some federal workers fails in Senate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate failed to advance either of two competing bills aimed at addressing pay for federal workers during a 23-day government shutdown, the second-longest in U.S. history.

federal employees during the government shutdown, a day before more than a million workers are set to miss a paycheck. One of the failed bills was a Republican-backed measure to allow employees who are deemed essential to receive a paycheck during a shutdown. Those workers, including troops, TSA agents and federal law enforcement like  the Capitol Police , are currently working without pay. An alternate version introduced by Democrats called for paying all federal employees – and blocking more mass layoffs by the Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget during the shutdown. \"We certainly shouldn't set up a system where the president of the United States gets to decide what agencies to shut down, who to pay and who not to pay, who to punish, who not to punish,\" said the sponsor of that bill, Sen.

Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., who introduced the GOP funding measure. The Republican-backed measure did not receive the 60 votes needed to pass. Republicans blocked the Democrats' version from a vote.

Many Republican lawmakers think Thanksgiving travel headaches will be a tipping point for Democrats. Democrats are also under pressure as states are beginning to announce that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, will run out soon. Democrats have also said that premium spikes during the open enrollment period beginning Nov. 1 for health plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace will push Republicans to budge. The Senate has now voted 12 times on the Republican-backed funding bill. The House has not held votes for several weeks, and senators are preparing to leave town for the weekend.

supposed to be payday for many federal workers. Instead, they're getting nothing \n         By Jenny Abamu, Andrea Hsu \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 5:01 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The sight was staggering in Prince George's County, Md., home to more than 60,000 federal workers:  middle-class professionals lined up  for boxes of pasta, protein and produce to feed their families. After a two-hour wait, Wanda Bright had finally reached the front of the line — just as the first batch of supplies ran out. The Capital Area Food Bank had started the day with 300 boxes, enough for 150 government employees to receive two boxes each. It turned out that the need was even greater. Fortunately, reinforcements had been called in, and cheers erupted as a second truck backed into the shopping center parking lot. Bright sighed with relief as volunteers handed over bread and other provisions to help get her family through the week. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"A lot of us are stressed, and it takes a toll on our mental health,\" says Bright, one of an estimated 700,000 federal workers across the U.S. now furloughed, meaning they are not working at the moment. \"Some people can handle this. A lot of people cannot.\" For many federal workers, Friday is supposed to be payday. Instead, they are getting nothing. No partial pay. No sign of  when their paychecks might resume . Meanwhile, the Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, particularly those doing work deemed critical to President Trump's priorities. \"We got the people that we want paid, paid, OK?\" Trump said at the White House last week. 1.4 million going without pay Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay,  according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a think tank in Washington, D.C. Roughly half of them are furloughed. The other half has been deemed essential and so is continuing to work. For many people in both groups, the lapse in congressional appropriations has brought on new financial strain in a year that has already been tough. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This whole fiscal year — 2025 — I was worried about my job, worried about getting RIF'd,\" says Jay, a furloughed worker from the National Institutes of Health, referring to the  reductions in force, or layoffs , that have already hit a number of agencies. \"It was draining, emotionally draining. Now the reality is setting in when you're not getting checks and you need to provide for your family.\" Jay, who asked to be identified by only his first name out of fear of losing his job, carried his two boxes away from the food distribution site in a stroller. He has a 1-year-old and a 5-year-old waiting for him at home. In Tampa, Fla., Tierra Carter is  still going to work , answering calls placed to the Social Security Administration's 1-800 number. Carter, who serves as a union representative with the American Federation of Government Employees, says the lack of a paycheck has forced her to take out loans and seek a hardship withdrawal from her 401(k). \"I kind of feel like I'm in a pool and I'm trying to swim to the top, but every time I get to the middle, I'm getting knocked back down,\" she says. Offering help to pay the bills Many federal workers earn less than $90,000 a year — 43%, according to an analysis of March 2024 government data by the  Pew Research Center . Even those earning more could see bills pile up quickly. Credit unions, where many federal workers do their banking, have started providing some financial relief. By Wednesday, Iowa-based Veridian Credit Union had already approved more than $55,000 in \"Government Advance Loans\" — short-term, interest-free loans — for 32 members affected by the shutdown. It had also processed 80 no-fee \"Delay-a-Pays\" for members. Similarly, Denver-based Westerra Credit Union and Redwood Credit Union in Northern California have each already provided nearly $100,000 in short-term, interest-free loans to members, with more applications coming in every day. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia, the Community Services Agency of the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, has been providing emergency financial support through its Federal Worker Solidarity Fund since February. But in recent days, requests for help with groceries, rent, mortgage payments and utility bills have soared, says Sig Meilus, the organization's director. Thursday morning, Meilus woke up to 20 new applications for assistance that had come into her inbox overnight. With no end to the shutdown in sight, she expects the trend to continue. \"Which also means that, unfortunately, our funds are dwindling quickly,\" she says. Shutdown begins to impact communities Because roughly two-thirds of the civilian federal workforce is still working despite the lapse in annual appropriations, the shutdown may not be all that apparent to a lot of Americans. But the longer it drags on, the more the public will begin to feel its economic effects, says Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Already, Akabas says, there might be a grocery store next to a federal building that's not getting as much foot traffic, or a day care that's seeing fewer children show up because their parents are furloughed. Over time, communities that have  higher densities of federal workers  could see less spending overall. \"Not everybody feels it yet, but it's actually affecting the broader economy,\" Akabas says. While Congress passed a law in 2019 ensuring back pay for federal employees after a shutdown ends, Trump suggested recently that furloughed workers shouldn't count on it. \"We're going to see,\" Trump said a week into the shutdown. \"Most of them are going to get back pay, and we're going to try and make sure of that. But some of them are being hurt very badly by the Democrats and they therefore won't qualify.\" Trump administration finds ways to pay some federal workers Across the government, many federal workers are still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has also engaged in what the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, called \"budgetary twister\" in an  interview on  The Charlie Kirk Show . Active-duty military personnel got their paychecks on schedule last week, after the Defense Department dipped into its  unused research and development funds  to find the money. Some 70,000 law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security are also now being paid from funds allocated to the department in Trump's tax-and-spending bill last summer. Yet many of their own colleagues are not getting paid — and likely won't be until the shutdown is over — creating an unequal playing field among federal employees that grows more slanted as the shutdown continues. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5584890","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"13:07:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he's ending trade talks with Canada over TV ads","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, citing a Canadian television ad that he claims falsely portrays a speech by former President Ronald Reagan as a tool to influence U.S. judicial decisions.

trade negotiations\" with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs that he said misstated the facts and called \"egregious behavior\" aimed at influencing U.S. court decisions. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The post on Trump's social media site came after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he aims to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations could further inflame trade tensions that already have been building between the two neighboring countries for months. Trump posted, \"The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.\" \"The ad was for $75,000. They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,\" Trump wrote on his social media site. \"TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\" Carney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The prime minister was set to leave Friday morning for a summit in Asia, while Trump is set to do the same Friday evening. Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that an ad created by the government of Ontario \"misrepresents the 'Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.\" It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission \"to use and edit the remarks.\" The foundation said it is \"reviewing legal options in this matter\" and invited the public to watch the unedited video of Reagan's address. Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term, but has since soured on. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Trump said earlier this week that he had seen the ad on television and said that it showed that his tariffs were having an impact. \"I saw an ad last night from Canada. If I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also,\" he said then. In his own post on X last week, Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, posted a link to the ad and the message: \"It's official: Ontario's new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched.\" He continued, \"Using every tool we have, we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.\" A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. But Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs. The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario.

Because they know it won’t last \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:30 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  You’d think after a tumultuous year for Elon Musk’s car company, Wall Street would be cheering Tesla’s record quarterly sales. They’re not.\n \n\n   \n  That’s for two main reasons: First, Tesla’s profit fell from a year ago and missed analysts’ estimates.\n \n\n   \n  Second, Tesla’s sales were largely booming last quarter because customers scrambled to nab electric cars before a US tax credit expired.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of Tesla ( TSLA ) fell 2% in after-market trading following the report, but ahead of a call for investors scheduled for 5:30 pm ET.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla has a difficult road ahead, and investors know that. The ones still cheering and buying Tesla shares are those who aren’t focused on car sales. Instead, they believe in Musk’s promise of a future based on self-driving cars and robotics.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, neither Musk nor CFO Vaibhav Taneja spent significant time talking about car sales or profits during an hour-long call with investors and analysts on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Instead they spent most of the time talking about the promise of self-driving vehicles, robotaxis and humanoid robots, without much insight on when those thing will contribute to Tesla’s bottom line.\n \n\n   \n  Judging by after-market stock trading, investors were not impressed. Shares were down a bit less than 2% as the call got underway but fell steadily during the first half, hitting a low of down   about 5%. While shares climbed back, they were still down more than 3% when the hour concluded.\n \n\n   \n  As for the barely discussed financial results, the company earned adjusted income of $1.8 billion in the third quarter, down 29% from a year ago. That was a slightly bigger drop in earnings than analysts had forecast, and net income tumbled 37%.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the earnings miss, it was still the company’s best quarter so far this year.\n \n\n   \n  The drop in earnings came even after Tesla reported  record sales  of nearly 500,000 cars during the quarter, as Americans rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  But electric vehicle sales in the US are widely expected to plunge in the fourth quarter. That’s because people who would have normally bought EVs later in the year flocked to buy cars early to lock in the tax break. The loss of the tax credit is expected to hurt demand among American buyers going forward. Tesla gets nearly half of its revenue from US customers.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla is also facing increased competition for EV sales globally, particularly from Chinese automakers. Those automakers not only dominate their own domestic market, but are also moving into Europe. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs this year, despite the fact that it does not sell any cars in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla sales worldwide fell 13% during the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier both due to increased competition, as well as backlash to Musk’s political activity.\n \n\n   \n    Drop in key source of profits\n \n\n   \n  But the removal of the EV tax credit is only part of Tesla’s problem. The Trump administration also eliminated what has been a key profit driver throughout the company’s history – the  sale of regulatory credits .\n \n\n   \n  In years past, the federal government set emissions limits on the total greenhouse gases that came out of all the cars a company sold in a given year. If a car company sold too many gas-guzzling pickups, as opposed to economical hatchbacks or cars with no emissions at all, it would have to buy “credits” from companies like Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration’s massive tax and spending bill passed in July eliminated the federal penalties for violating emissions rules, and thus the need for automakers to buy regulatory credits.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the change in the law, the company still reported $417 million in regulatory credit sales in the third quarter. But that was $322 million less than a year ago, and the revenue loss caused a direct hit to the company’s bottom line. CFO Taneja did say the company entered into new regulatory credit contracts in the quarter, but did not give any details on those contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Regulatory credit sales have brought in $11.4 billion for Tesla since 2019. Sometimes they were   the only thing keeping the company profitable at all – including in the first three months of this year.\n \n\n   \n    Robots and robotaxis\n \n\n   \n  Tesla launched the company’s long-promised  robotaxi  offering with limited service in late June, with Musk promising much grander things to come.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Musk said he thinks the robotaxi service would be operating in eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. But that’s a long step back from the last earnings call in July ,  when he said the service would be available to half the US population by the year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  Musk said Tesla is still set to start production of the Cybercab, a vehicle for the robotaxi service that does not have a steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, by the second quarter next year. ﻿But the service now requires has a human safety driver sitting in the driver’s seat during each ride.\n \n\n   \n  “So so our goal is to be actually paranoid about deployment because obviously even one accident will be frontpage headline news worldwide,” he said. “So it’s better for us to take a cautious approach here. But we do expect to have no safety drivers in the car in Austin… within a few months.”\n \n\n   \n  It also said production lines for the first generation of its planned Optimus humanoid robots are being installed in anticipation of volume production. But it did not give details of when production might begin.\n \n\n   \n    Vote on Musk’s $1 trillion pay package\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s call was also Musk’s first time talking to investors since the company unveiled a new proposed pay package for the CEO, which could award him stock worth  $1 trillion . Shareholders are set to vote on that pay package at Tesla’s annual meeting next month. CFO Taneja took time at the end of the call to urge shareholders to support the pay package.\n \n\n   \n  Musk didn’t get into much detail about the compensation package, characterizing it as necessary for him to be able to keep control of the company.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” he said. “It’s just, you know, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?”\n \n\n   \n  “I just think that there needs to be enough voting control to give us strong influence,” he said near the end of the call, “but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-republicans-redistricting-battle-map-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00-04:00","title":"North Carolina Legislature Gives Final Approval to New Congressional Map That Could Give GOP One More Seat in US House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The North Carolina legislature has passed a new congressional map, Senate Bill 249, on a 66-48 vote, which shifts the state’s representation in the U.S. House to give Republicans one additional seat, bringing their total to 11 out of 14.

gives final approval to new congressional map that could give GOP one more seat in US House \n       \n  By Fredreka Schouten, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:31 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The North Carolina House on Wednesday gave final approval to a new congressional map aimed at helping Republicans eke out an additional GOP seat to help shore up the party’s majority in the US House after next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Bill 249 passed on a 66-48 vote. Members of the public were escorted out of the chamber after protests broke out shortly before the vote.\n \n\n   \n  State law does not give Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.\n \n\n   \n  Stein on Wednesday called the move a “disgraceful” abuse of power.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re afraid that they will lose in the midterms and afraid to say no to the president. So, they’ve turned their backs on you to silence your vote in the 2026 election. It’s outrageous,” Stein said in a video message posted after the vote. “When a candidate or a party loses an election, you’re supposed to work like hell to connect better with voters so that you can win the next time. You do not rig the rules of the game to guarantee your victory, the voters be damned.”\n \n\n   \n  The new map targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines are explicitly drawn to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina. Under the map used in last year’s elections, Republicans control 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  “While families in eastern North Carolina face real struggles and concerns, our state has prioritized passing a new congressional map that affects only our region, with the intention of predetermining the outcome of an election 377 days away,” said Davis in a statement released Wednesday evening. “It is not only one of the darkest moments in our state’s history, but the way it was done—offering limited public participation by those affected and ignoring the voices of those who did participate—is morally wrong on all fronts. Still, I remain committed to ensuring every voice in eastern North Carolina is heard, no matter how the lines are drawn.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now here we are in North Carolina, doing a fifth redistricting in five years. It’s not because of the census. It’s not because of a court order. It’s because of a command from a president. Unprecedented in U.S. history,” state Rep. Marcia Morey, a Democrat from Durham, noted, calling the process “map warfare.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans acknowledged the motivation behind the new map was helping President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Please support this legal proposal to help North Carolina help President Donald J. Trump make America great again,” said Rep. Jimmy Dixon from Warsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The final vote came just two days after Republican lawmakers, who control North Carolina’s legislature, formally opened debate on the map.\n \n\n   \n  The state joined  Texas  and  Missouri  in drawing new lines to benefit the GOP, bringing to seven the total number of new Republican-friendly districts created this year.\n \n\n   \n  The Tar Heel State was the latest state to begin work on a once-rare, mid-decade redistricting. The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip just a handful of seats to take control of the House after next year’s congressional elections.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican who helped oversee the map-drawing, described the high stakes in stark terms.\n \n\n   \n  “The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular: draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the congressional delegation,” he said. If Democrats take control of the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” Hise added.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans in North Carolina acted swiftly to accede to Trump’s wishes. State lawmakers held the first open meeting about the new map on Monday morning and approved it in the state Senate the following day – despite sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the public who showed up at the state Capitol in Raleigh to protest the move.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is a politically competitive state. And Democrats such as Stein and his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, have captured statewide offices in recent election cycles. But Republican leaders this week framed the lopsided congressional map as an outcome Trump deserved given his electoral success in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times,” the state Sen. Phil Berger, the top Republican in the Senate, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    State-by-state battle\n \n\n   \n  Legislators in deep-red Texas kicked off the political arms race this year with a  map that seeks to send five more Republicans  to Congress. Missouri Republicans also have drawn new lines aimed at adding  an additional GOP member  to the state’s congressional delegation. Both face court challenges, and activists in Missouri are seeking to overturn the map through a petition drive.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the biggest pushback from Democrats comes from  California, which launched a redistricting effort in response to Texas . A multimillion-dollar advertising and get-out-the vote campaign now is underway to persuade voters to temporarily override congressional maps drawn by an independent commission next month and create as many as five new US House seats for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have a clear advantage over Democrats in the number of states that could redraw maps. The GOP holds control of the governor’s office and both chambers of the legislature in 23 states, compared to Democrats’ 15.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in other Republican states also are contemplating new maps, including Kansas, where legislators have  approved  $460,000 to fund a special session that would target the lone Democrat representing the state in Washington, four-term Rep. Sharice Davids. Two-thirds of the state House and Senate must agree to call a special session.\n \n\n   \n  In Indiana, where Republicans hold a 7-2 edge in the US House, the White House has repeatedly urged the GOP lawmakers in the majority in the state legislature to target at least one of the Democratic-held seats. Vice President JD Vance has twice visited the state to lobby legislators.\n \n\n   \n  Two other Republican-controlled states, Ohio and Utah, also are in throes of redistricting battles that began before Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  In Utah, a judge found that an existing map hadn’t followed guidelines imposed by a citizen ballot measure. Earlier this month, the GOP-dominated legislature passed a new congressional map that could give Democrats a slim chance of breaking the GOP’s monopoly on the state’s congressional delegation.\n \n\n   \n  That map needs to go back before the judge for her approval, with a final decision expected in early November. At the same time, Republicans in the state have launched a signature-gathering petition in the hopes of blocking the new map.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, the redrawing of its congressional districts is an outgrowth of a state law that requires maps approved without bipartisan support be redrawn after four years. Crafting new maps will ultimately fall to the Republican-controlled General Assembly, likely next month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are vowing to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrat in the US House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is weighing an effort to counter Republicans in Ohio. If the map is passed along partisan lines, state law allows a voter referendum that could invalidate the map, and Jeffries is prepared to go all-in to support that effort — including raising money, according to a person familiar with his planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose internal deliberations.\n \n\n   \n  John Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Democrats will mount lawsuits, protests and citizen-led ballot initiatives to push back on the actions in GOP-dominated states.\n \n\n   \n  “Republicans are openly stating that they need to take away the voting power of the American people through gerrymandering in order to win the 2026 midterms,” Bisognano said in a statement. “That alone is a sign of incredible weakness. The fact that they are taking the gerrymandering crisis to even more states beyond Texas and Missouri underscores just how scared they are of the opposition they are facing from the American people – even in deep red states.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic fury in North Carolina\n \n\n   \n  Trump has praised the new lines, writing last week on Truth Social that it “would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ district representing a swath of eastern North Carolina is the only competitive US House seat remaining in North Carolina after previous rounds of redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump won the district last November even as Davis won a second term by less than two percentage points. The new map makes the district more favorable to Republicans by swapping out several counties with more conservative communities on the coast.\n \n\n   \n  Some North Carolina Republicans argued that actions in California – and other deep-blue states – required them to respond. “This is a political arms race that Republicans did not start,” Hise said, pointing for former President  Barack Obama ’s support of the California redistricting initiative.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic state lawmakers along with multiple members of the public who spoke during the elections committee meeting denounced the map as a brazen power grab.\n \n\n   \n  “California hasn’t redistricted a thing,” Mark Swallow of Democracy Out Loud, a liberal activist group, said during the public comment period in a Senate committee meeting. “What they’ve done is respond to Texas, which started this fiasco for our country, and put an initiative on the ballot to ask Californians if they should be redistricted.”\n \n\n   \n  “You should do the same,” he told legislators, “but I doubt that you will because you know that North Carolinians will never approve this scheme. So, you are liars and cheats. That’s what this boils down to. You’re liars and cheats.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic state Sen.

Survivors have advice \n         By Marielle Segarra \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When I was in middle school, I'd spend hours sitting in a dark closet in my bedroom on the phone with my cousin. We'd gab about our crushes, using their secret code names. We'd share funny stories about our families. She was someone who I could rely on to make me laugh. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last year, my cousin was that person for me again. But this time, I was sitting in a chemo chair with an IV in my arm and a freezing cold cap strapped to my head to preserve my hair follicles. My diagnosis of breast cancer hit me like a rogue wave. But my cousin was there with me, holding my hand and making me smile. Getting cancer at 34 was shocking and life-changing. But through it all, I never felt alone. The people in my life were there for me in so many different ways. Their steady support kept me going. It can be hard to know how to show up for someone with cancer. But from my own experience, and from talking to other cancer survivors, I've learned that the best thing you can do is think about what you're good at, and what you, in particular, might offer your person at this moment. Even if you don't know anyone with cancer now, it will probably affect someone you love.   The National Cancer Institute  estimates that 39% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives. Here are four specific roles that friends and family members can play for a loved one with cancer. They each meet a critical need that cancer patients often have. Role No. 1: Doctor's appointment buddy In the early days of my cancer diagnosis, I was meeting with lots of doctors, getting second and third opinions. I wanted someone there who could take notes and ask follow-up questions. I asked my friend Zoe Saunders to come with me to meet my surgeon. She's an audio producer, so she has a lot of experience supporting hosts and reporters during interviews and summarizing what was said. We prepared a list of questions ahead of time, and then during the appointment, she let me take the lead. She checked off questions as we went along, then wrote up notes from the visit in a shared document. ⭐  This role might be for you if  … you're organized, detail-oriented and comfortable in medical environments. This is also a great role for someone with a medical background. NPR listener Rich Coker, whose wife Maya was diagnosed with cancer in 2024, says that having a couple of doctor friends accompany them to early appointments was invaluable. \"They asked questions we wouldn't know to ask in our shock at the news and newness to these systems,\" he says. Role No. 2: Procedure pal and patient advocate You can also go with your loved one to their scans, surgeries, and radiation and chemotherapy appointments. These will be a bit different from a standard doctor's appointment because they're less about asking questions and taking notes and more about providing emotional and physical support, and advocating for the person as needed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When I did chemo, I was at the hospital for seven hours. The cold cap felt like having a frozen bowling ball strapped to my head. I was in pain — and I was cold — so it was important to have someone there who was comfortable cuddling with me to warm me up, and who wasn't afraid to talk to a nurse and be a little pushy if I wasn't getting the medication I needed. I also wanted someone who could make me laugh and who wouldn't think it was weird when I started praying the rosary. I had four infusions, and I brought one person per visit: my dad, my mom, my godmother, then my cousin. ⭐  This role might be for you if …  you're the kind of person who is comfortable with physical touch, sitting in silence, praying or even bringing your best comedy routine (depending on the person's mood). You should also be willing to advocate for your loved one if needed. Role No. 3: Companion after surgeries or infusions I did chemo on Fridays, and the Mondays after were always the hardest for me. My friend would come by and bring me lentil soup because I was craving it — and because it was creamy. After chemo, people often develop mouth sores and lose their sense of taste, and the creamy texture can feel comforting. She also brought me little presents, like a headscarf with pasta shapes on it, to cover up my head as I was losing my hair. As I lay on the couch, she sat on the floor and held my hand. ⭐  This role might be for you if …  you have a strong stomach (you might see blood, burns or healing incisions) and if you're able to be mentally strong despite seeing your loved one at a low point. Role No. 4: Household helper and meal planner  One of the biggest gifts you can give to someone who's going through cancer treatment is to take on some of their day-to-day mental load. Here are some ways to do that: \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Offer to bring over dinner.  That saves them a trip to the grocery store and the energy of cooking. It also saves them having to think about what they're going to eat tonight. Instead of asking, \"What can I do?\", make a specific offer.  Don't give your friend the extra task of assigning  you  a task. Say:  Hey, can I come do a load of laundry for you? Walk the dog? Bring you a smoothie?  Coordinate friends who want to help.  Coker says when his wife Maya got sick, a friend created a calendar \"where people could sign up to take our kids to their activities or accompany my wife to appointments and chemotherapy treatments.\" That took some of the planning of day-to-day life off their plate. Take initiative.  NPR listener Indira White, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, says a friend would come over and \"just start doing the dishes or tidying something up. That was really helpful.\"   ⭐  This role might be for you if …  you're good at organizing and planning, and willing to take initiative. A last tip No matter what role you end up fulfilling, remember that you don't have to be the person who makes this all better for someone or who offers them the perfect pearl of wisdom. Debra Jarvis, host of the podcast  The Final Say: Conversations with People Facing Death , a hospital chaplain and a breast cancer survivor, says you might ask this simple question to your loved one when you talk to them: \"Where are you with all this today?\" she says. \"Then just wait. They may give you an answer. Then I would say wait a little more, and then the real answer might come out,\" she says. You may not always know what to say to your friend, but curiosity is a good start. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib, with art direction by Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

pristine Alaska wildlife refuge to oil and gas drilling \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 12:26 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         JUNEAU, Alaska — The Trump administration on Thursday finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to potential oil and gas drilling, renewing a long-simmering debate over whether to drill in one of the nation's environmental jewels. U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the decision Thursday that paves the way for future lease sales within the refuge's 1.5 million-acre ( 631,309 hectare) coastal plain, an area that's considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich'in. The plan fulfills pledges made by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to reopen this portion of the refuge to possible development. Trump's bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, passed during the summer, called for at least four lease sales within the refuge over a 10-year period. Burgum was joined in Washington, D.C., by Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state's congressional delegation for this and other lands-related announcements, including the department's decision to restore oil and gas leases in the refuge that had been canceled by the prior administration. A federal judge in March said the Biden administration lacked authority to cancel the leases, which were held by a state corporation that was the major bidder in the first-ever lease sale for the refuge held at the end of Trump's first term. Leaders in Indigenous Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and they oppose drilling there. Leaders of Kaktovik, an Iñupiaq community within the refuge, support drilling and consider responsible oil development to be key to their region's economic well-being. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It is encouraging to see decisionmakers in Washington advancing policies that respect our voice and support Kaktovik's long term success,\" Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp. President Charles \"CC\" Lampe said in a statement. A second lease sale in the refuge, held near the end of President Joe Biden's term, yielded no bidders but critics of the sale argued it was too restrictive in scope. Meda DeWitt, Alaska senior manager with The Wilderness Society, said that with Thursday's announcement the administration \"is placing corporate interests above the lives, cultures and spiritual responsibilities of the people whose survival depends on the Porcupine caribou herd, the freedom to live from this land and the health of the Arctic Refuge.\" The actions detailed Thursday are consistent with those laid out by Trump on his return to office in January, which also included calls to speed the building of a road to connect the communities of King Cove and Cold Bay. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Burgum on Thursday announced completion of a land exchange deal aimed at building the road that would run through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through the refuge to the all-weather airport at Cold Bay, seeing it as vital to accessing emergency medical care. Dunleavy and the congressional delegation have supported the effort, calling it a life and safety issue. Conservationists vowed a legal challenge to the agreement, with some tribal leaders worried a road will drive away migratory birds they rely on. The refuge, near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. Past land exchange proposals have been met with controversy and litigation. The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said the latest land agreement would exchange about 500 acres (202 hectares) of \"ecologically irreplaceable wilderness lands\" within the refuge for up to 1,739 acres (703.7 hectares) of King Cove Corp. lands outside the refuge. Tribal leaders in some communities further north, in Yup'ik communities in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, have expressed concerns that development of a road would harm the migratory birds important to their subsistence ways of life. \"Along with the Native villages of Hooper Bay and Paimiut, we absolutely plan to challenge this decision in court,\" said Cooper Freeman, the center's Alaska director. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, told reporters she has been fighting for the land access for King Cove throughout her tenure and has been to both the community and the refuge. She called the refuge a \"literal bread basket\" for many waterfowl and said it was in everyone's interest to ensure that a road is built with minimal disturbance. \"I think it's important to remember that nobody's talking about a multi-lane paved road moving lots of big trucks back and forth,\" she said. \"It is still an 11-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1171741599","dateOfPublication":"2025-02-18","timeOfPublication":"06:18:00.000-05:00","title":"Watch NPR's News Roundup","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article highlights NPR's daily visual newscast, NPR News Now, which airs from 7 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. ET and is accessible through smart speaker devices such as Amazon Alexa and Google Nest.

Behind them stood a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime partner of the late Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein himself took the photo. Her name was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the most public accusers of abuse by Epstein and the many powerful men Giuffre says she was trafficked to in the early 2000s. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida on charges related to soliciting prostitution. His 2019 federal sex-trafficking charges were dismissed after his death by suicide while awaiting trial in New York. Maxwell was later convicted of crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors and is serving a 20-year sentence in Texas. Days before the publication of Giuffre's memoir,  Nobody's Girl,  Buckingham Palace released a statement from Prince Andrew. It said he had agreed to give up his title as Duke of York amid fresh scrutiny of the allegations. In  Nobody's Girl , Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in 2001 and that he guessed correctly she was then 17 years old. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying. \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled — as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. Prince Andrew has consistently denied Giuffre's accusations. Epstein  reached a financial settlement  with Giuffre in 2009. Prince Andrew  later settled  with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide in April, at age 41, just months before her book's release. Her collaborator on  Nobody's Girl , author and journalist Amy Wallace, and Giuffre's younger brother, Sky Roberts, spoke about the memoir with  Morning Edition's  Leila Fadel. Here are five takeaways from the conversation.  1. Giuffre called her father \"the original betrayer\" The memoir begins with the abuse Giuffre said started when she was about 7 years old. Before calling out Epstein, Maxwell and their wealthy friends, Wallace said Giuffre wanted to name her \"original betrayer.\" \"When we began unpacking all of that, she had always said 'I was abused by a family friend,' and that was true as far as it went, but she had also been abused by her own father,\" Wallace said. \"You have to understand Virginia's history… victims of sexual trafficking are not born, they are made, and they are made by terrible experiences that they have over years.\" Giuffre was 16 when she met Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago resort, where she worked as a locker room attendant in the spa. \"And up to that point, the world that had been revealed to her, was a world in which adult men had sex with young girls, children, and didn't pay the price for it,\" Wallace added. Giuffre's father denies these accusations. 2. Her \"toughest battle\" came at home  Giuffre was married for over 20 years and had three children. Near the end of her life, she was estranged from her husband. Her brother said she had begun to speak openly about the domestic abuse she had allegedly experienced over the years. \"She fought off Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and she was very proud of that with her survivor sister. She wanted to continue that advocacy work. But I would say, the hardest fight of her battle was in her backyard with her husband, and she was a little embarrassed about that, as anybody would be coming forward,\" Roberts said. Giuffre's husband denies these allegations. 3. Her brothers were by her side before her death in Australia Earlier this year, Giuffre was recovering from a car crash and renal failure. Her brothers traveled to Australia to help care for her. \"At one point, we had a jet lined up for her on a tarmac ready to bring her home so she could get medical treatment,\" Roberts shared. \"We were with her in her final couple of weeks. And, you know, I was, I was, I was the one that found my sister.\" Having displayed so much strength facing the legal and public battles against Epstein and others, her brother says they thought she \"would make it through because she'd pulled through so many times before.\" 4. Giuffre wanted the Epstein files released President Trump has not ruled out a pardon for Maxwell. \"Well, I'll take a look at it. I'll speak to the DOJ,\" Trump  said earlier this month  to a CNN reporter regarding a possible pardon for Maxwell. \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider — I don't know anything about it. I will speak to the DOJ.\" Wallace said those who doubt Maxwell's involvement in the abuse, \"will get their answers in this book.\" \"She was not on the sidelines,\" Wallace said. \"She was sexually abusing herself. She was telling girls to sexually service her. She was hurting some of those girls when she was angry at them in a sexual way.\" Roberts said he was astounded to hear the president's stance on a possible pardon for Maxwell. \"At one point he ran his campaign on the fact that he would release these [Epstein] files,\" Roberts said. \"My sister had hope that he would. She was hopeful.\" 5. Giuffre's story is larger than the narrative of sex abuse Wallace said Epstein was not an anomaly or \"some super apex predator,\" but rather a sign of our times. \"This is part of our culture,\" she said. \"Wealthy people, powerful people get to treat people less wealthy terribly,\" she said. \"And I think that's why it resonates beyond sexual abuse. I think people are sick of it.\" This article discusses suicide.

It's of now-disgraced Prince Andrew with his hand around the waist of a teen girl in a pink top and jeans. That was Virginia Roberts Giuffre. As an adult, she was one of the most outspoken survivors of abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell. Prince Andrew was one of many powerful men that Giuffre says she was trafficked to by the wealthy pair. On Friday, Buckingham Palace released a statement from Prince Andrew. It said he had given up his title as Duke of York amid fresh scrutiny of the allegations, which he has consistently denied. Virginia wrote about this and all she endured in a book called \"Nobody's Girl.\" But before it was published, she died by suicide in the spring. I spoke to Amy Wallace, her collaborator on the book, along with her brother Sky Roberts. And a warning - sexual abuse and suicide come up in our conversation. The book opens with the last email Wallace received from Virginia. AMY WALLACE: She basically just said, in the case of my passing, I need and want this book to be published - not just for me, but for all survivors. FADEL: Sky, you're written about so lovingly. You were her baby brother. You were with her in Australia near the end of her life. What do you want the world to know about your sister? SKY ROBERTS: I look at my sister as a hero. But at a very fundamental level, like, you can tell in that book, like, how loving she was and how much she wanted to kind of protect me in a lot of ways. But then, as she progressed and she got older and became a mother, you know, there's even circumstances where she was protecting her own daughter. And then I think that expanded to her protecting your daughters, because when she held her daughter for the first time, it was like, this can never happen again. FADEL: Amy, I want to talk more about the beginning of the book and her childhood. The book goes back much further, to abuses that she first encountered at - what? - 7 years old? If you could just talk about what it was like for Virginia to write in such detail. WALLACE: Well, I mean, the entire book is an exercise in trying to show her in all her complexity. FADEL: Yes. WALLACE: And when we began unpacking all of that, she had always said, I was abused by a family friend. And that was... FADEL: Yeah. WALLACE: ...True, as far as it went. But she had also been abused by her own father. As we worked on the book, she said, how can I be calling out all these people who came later - Epstein, Maxwell, all of their wealthy and influential friends who she was trafficked to - and not acknowledge or name the original betrayer of me, the original abuser of me? You have to understand Virginia's history, which is a lot of the victims have tragedy in their pasts, to understand that victims of sexual trafficking are not born. They are made. And they are made by a terrible experience that they have over years. And when you understand that Virginia was just 16 years old when she met Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago, where she was working as a $9-an-hour towel girl in the spa. And up to that point, the world that had been revealed to her was a world in which adult men had sex with young girls - children - and didn't pay the price for it. FADEL: Yeah. And when you say her original betrayer, you're referring to her father? WALLACE: Her father. So you have to understand - she didn't believe that if she walked out the door of Epstein's Manhattan townhouse that the world outside was going to be any better to her. FADEL: Yeah. And you note in the book that you reached out to her father. Actually, there's a lot of meticulous reporting done in this, reaching out to everybody she's accused, and he's continued to deny that. Throughout Virginia's pages, she writes about not being believed - about how it made her feel worthless as a child and teen, about the way she was broken down and used. What Virginia didn't write and what came to light later was that she says her husband was physically abusing her. It's something he denies. ROBERTS: Our sister was very transparent with us, especially towards the end of her relationship, about the abuse that she was incurring for 22 years throughout her marriage, on and off. She fought off Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and she was very proud of that with her survivor sisters. She wanted to continue that advocacy work. But, like, I would say the hardest fight of her battle was in her backyard with her husband. And she was a little embarrassed about that, as anybody would be coming forward. She's a strong figure. FADEL: At the end of her life, Sky was with her. ROBERTS: She was laughing when we were there 'cause the chickens would chase me around, and we nicknamed one Raptor at one point. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: But, yes. We were with her in her final couple of weeks, and... FADEL: Yeah. ROBERTS: You know, I was the one that found my sister. And... FADEL: I'm so sorry, Sky. I didn't know that. ROBERTS: Yeah. It was - you know, I think we all thought she would make it through because she'd pulled through so many times before. FADEL: You know, I've been thinking a lot. The fight around Epstein is not over. Right now there is a battle over the release of more Epstein documents. And then there's the question of whether Ghislaine Maxwell might get a pardon, which is something President Trump has not ruled out. I mean, what are you thinking, Sky, as you see what's happening around Epstein and Maxwell even today and what she would think? ROBERTS: I think it's very important to first start with the fact that this is the president of the United States. And at one point, he ran his campaign on the fact that he would release these files. My sister had hope that he would. WALLACE: Yeah, and I would add to that. Anyone who has any questions about how involved Ghislaine Maxwell was in the actual sexual abuse of girls will get their answers in this book. She was involved. She was not on the sidelines. This is a woman who has never offered any solace or empathy to the people that she hurt or that Epstein hurt. Jeffrey Epstein has been dead for years, but the specter of him lives on. And I'm so grateful for that, frankly, because this didn't die with him. He's not just some super apex predator who was an anomaly. This is part of our culture. Wealthy people, powerful people get to treat people less wealthy terribly. And I think that's why it resonates beyond sexual abuse. I think people are sick of it. FADEL: Amy Wallace and Sky Roberts, thank you so much for speaking with us. WALLACE: Thank you for having us. ROBERTS: Thank you. FADEL: The book \"Nobody's Girl\" is out this week. It's Virginia Roberts Giuffre's story. If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

\n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON, D.C. — Even before the No Kings rallies kicked off last weekend, some Republicans cast the protests in a sinister light. House Speaker Mike Johnson called them \" Hate America \" rallies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that they would attract \"the most unhinged in the Democratic party.\" Instead, the rallies were most notable for a funhouse Noah's Ark of frogs, pandas, koalas, woodchucks, sharks and lobsters. Taking a page from the protest playbook in Portland, people showed up in inflatable animal costumes. In Washington, a poodle and a chicken danced to drum music with three dinosaurs next to the National Gallery, a short walk from the U.S. Capitol. Scott Rohrbach, a senior optical engineer at NASA, came dressed as a unicorn. It was not his first choice. \"I would have come as a frog, but I couldn't find a frog,\" said Rohrbach, disappointed that all the frog costumes were sold out. Rohrbach said he came to protest because he fears that under President Trump, future elections may not be fair. He wore the costume to counter the Republican narrative that protesters like him are hate-filled, anti-American radicals. Inspiration from a frog suit \"One of the things fascists can't handle is humor,\" said Rohrbach, who added that fellow protesters posed with him for selfies and kids gave him high-fives. President Trump has said repeatedly that he is neither a fascist nor a king and dismissed the rallies. \"I think it's a joke,\" he told reporters. \"I looked at the people. They're not representative of this country.\" The president answered the demonstrations with his own brand of humor, posting  an AI-generated video  of him wearing a crown while flying a jet and dumping what looked like excrement on protesters. So what inspired Rohrbach and so many others to dress up like animals and mythical creatures last weekend? It all started earlier this month in Portland. A man in a frog suit was trying to help a fellow protester at an anti-ICE rally. A law enforcement officer responded by spraying the suit's air valve with a chemical agent as  captured on video . The image of the officer in a black helmet and shield going after the protester in the frog costume caught the eye of many, including Jordy Lybeck, a political streamer. Lybeck began brainstorming in real time with his viewers. \"How much are those outfits?\" Lybeck wondered aloud. \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What if somebody bought a lot of them and distributed them at the facility?\" That's exactly what Lybeck and Brooks Brown, who streams about philosophy, did. They raised money online, bought more costumes and drove them to the ICE facility in Portland. They call it \"Operation Inflation.\" The goal: Undermine Trump's argument that he had to deploy troops because Portland was, as he put it, a \"war zone.\" Absurdist humor as an effective tactic \"People who were watching at home saw that we were mocking the lies about how Portland is a wasteland of burning nightmares,\" Brown told NPR. He also said the costumes make protesters seem less threatening — it's hard to see out of or move quickly in an inflatable suit. Brown said he spoke to a police officer on the scene who thought the same. \"He said he knows anyone in these costumes isn't going to be doing something that they've got to run from,\" said Brown, \"which is fair, because if you haven't been in one of these costumes, you cannot run in them.\" Kim Lane Scheppele is a Princeton professor who studies democracy and authoritarianism. She says absurdist humor can be an effective tactic against autocrats, which is how she views Trump. Scheppele recalled a case in the Siberian city of Barnaul in 2012. Critics of Vladimir Putin, who was running for a third term as Russian president, put dozens of children's toys in the main square. The toys, which included teddy bears and Transformers, held signs criticizing corruption and calling for fair elections. Toys in Siberia  City officials in Barnaul determined the demonstration was unsanctioned. When demonstrators petitioned to hold a second protest, officials rejected it on the grounds that the toys were \"inanimate objects\" and not \"citizens of Russia,\" according to Britain's  Guardian newspaper  and the U.S. government's  Radio Free Europe .

      In  Hedda , an   intoxicating headrush of a film written and directed by Nia DaCosta, party guests are descending upon an English estate when the 1951 Betty Hutton song \" It's A Man! \" begins playing. The needle drop is brief, but the lyrics you don't hear in the film reveal the song to be a pointed insertion. \"If it acts just like it's the boss / When it knows that  you  are, of course … It's a man!\" \"It's A Man!\" is a cheeky ode to the ineptitude of manhood, poking fun at patriarchy's trappings while imploring women to half-heartedly accept them. How fitting for it to soundtrack this spirited take on  Hedda Gabler , about a woman seeking to escape boredom with her bland academic husband by manipulating the affections and interests of everyone in her orbit. Henrik Ibsen's 19th century   play has been adapted for stage and screen many times, providing generations of powerhouse actresses (Ingrid Bergman, Glenda Jackson, Cate Blanchett) with a dastardly title role to play. With DaCosta's interpretation, a slinky and mischievous Tessa Thompson comfortably sashays into that lineage, and the result is a dazzling rendering of caste, lust and ambition in 1950s England. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This  Hedda's  Hedda stands out from her predecessors, as a mixed-race woman born out of wedlock to the renowned General Gabler. All her father left her when he died were his prized guns and a scant proximity to high society, which will hardly do for someone like Hedda — who, as one character puts it, possesses an \"insatiable appetite.\" To maintain a foothold in the upper echelons, she's married handsome scholar and \"dull fool\" George Tesman (Tom Bateman), convincing him to go into debt to purchase a grand countryside estate they cannot afford. Naturally, the occasion calls for a fabulous party they cannot afford. DaCosta confines  Hedda  to a roughly 24-hour period, including said party, during which unfolds a wickedly absorbing chain of events. As guests pour into the decadent digs (the film was  shot on the grounds of Flintham Hall  in Nottinghamshire), the married hosts' many worlds — professional, personal, or as is often the case, both — collide consequentially throughout the evening. Hedda's \"bohemian\" friends mix and mingle with George's stuffy academic cohort; Thea (Imogen Poots), an old schoolmate of Hedda's, crashes the party and finds herself unwittingly ensnared in Hedda's web of machinations. But the most crucial visitor is the formidable Eileen Lövborg (Nina Hoss, a force), Hedda's one-time paramour, and George's present rival for a university position. The women have plenty of unfinished business between them that Hedda is more than eager to exploit, to the most extreme ends. As Hedda, Thompson has a ball being the agent of chaos, asserting her dominance through calculated mannerisms: an affected way of speaking that's vaguely Brit- ish  and calls to mind the Transatlantic accents of classic Hollywood stars like Katharine Hepburn; curt remarks accompanied by her gentle yet potent guiding touch of an arm or shoulder with those white-gloved fingers. The actress understands Hedda is herself doing a  performance , a putting on of airs that seems to have been perfected through years of being an outsider, an act she envisions as a necessary tool for survival. Very rarely does that mask slip and reveal vulnerability, but when it does — it  goes.  Though this façade is apparent to pretty much everyone except the clueless George, her natural magnetism nevertheless allows her to impulsively scheme and play her party guests like a fiddle to get what she wants — to a point. DaCosta's most significant alterations to Ibsen's text serve  Hedda  well. Bending Eileen's gender (previously Ejlert) while setting the events post-World War II but pre-Swinging '60s lends that character's professional aspirations added heft, and puts her in tension with Hedda for reasons stretching beyond that of a mere scorned lover. (The best scenes involve the two women verbally sparring over the life choices each has made.) And Hedda's race is integral to the interplay. Though hardly overstated and rarely commented upon directly, the viewer can infer and understand plenty about her twisted relationship with the acerbic family friend Judge Brack (Nicholas Pinnock). As her closest confidante and another Black person who's managed to accrue some standing among the white elite, he's the only one who truly \"gets\" Hedda as much as she can be \"gotten\" — the  Addison DeWitt to her Margo Channing  via dry, scathing observations of Hedda's diabolical behavior, who sometimes, even, goads her on. To choreograph this bumpy night, DaCosta assembles a stellar team that includes cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, production designer Cara Brower, and editor Jacob Secher Schulsinger. They find the beat and make the film dance, sometimes literally: a standout moment finds the revelers swinging in the golden-hued ballroom to a live band playing another Betty Hutton number, \" It's Oh So Quiet ,\" a song that oscillates between a whispered, serene waltz and the explosion of a big, strutting brass band, not unlike the structure and cadence of  Hedda . Suddenly, the music fades to a dim echo but DaCosta's camera keeps swirling close-up on Hedda letting loose, her exerted gasps and breaths amplified. (Those sonic exhalations echo throughout composer Hildur Guðnadóttir's evocative score.) This sequence sets the stage for the seamless transition into the pivotal next act – and presents a visually effective moment which struck me as a possible homage to Spike Lee. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The filmmaking industry's progress being as slow and nonlinear as it is, DaCosta occupies a rare space as a Black woman filmmaker. Unlike many of her peers and forebears, she's had the opportunity to helm five features in less than a decade, and each has been a totally different vibe: her feature debut  Little Woods , for one, is a quiet and very good indie about a parolee hustling to survive and support her sister in North Dakota (also starring Thompson); her next film is the zombie franchise installment  28 Years Later: The Bone Temple . But  Hedda  suggests DaCosta's at her most creatively free, at least thus far, in this mode. For the viewer, she excavates the pleasures in watching an antiheroine meddle maniacally and unabashedly, spinning a spectacular mess that's impossible to look away from. Hedda may or may not possess any real, tangible power in her day-to-day life. But for a few hours at least, she is the boss.

24, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The U.S. military carried out two more strikes on alleged drug boats this week. The attacks were not in the Caribbean Sea but in the eastern Pacific Ocean, signaling an expansion of the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking from South America. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a video on X of a blue speedboat skipping along the ocean waters before being hit and then bursting into flames. \"Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,\" Hegseth wrote in the Wednesday message. \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness — only justice.\" The strikes represented the eighth and ninth known boat attacks, which have killed at least 37 people. The Trump administration has yet to provide public evidence to support its assertions that the individuals on the boats were cartel members and that the vessels were transporting drugs, raising concerns about the legality of the strikes and the real goals of the White House campaign. Prior to the strikes in the Pacific, the U.S. military had been ramping up the number of troops and naval ships in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela. International law experts say it's an unprecedented amount of military hardware to confront suspected drug boats, which has fueled questions about whether the operation is about countering narcotics trafficking or instead toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's such overkill in this naval deployment that there could be no justification if all the United States is trying to do is to attack a couple of small boats and intimidate drug traffickers,\" said Benjamin Gedan, who led the Venezuela portfolio at the Obama White House. \"It's either a bluff meant to scare the pants off the Venezuelan generals and encourage them to rise up and remove the president … or actual preparations for some sort of war with Venezuela.\" Trump has insisted that he has the legal authority to launch the attacks in international waters, calling it a national security issue to save American lives. During a meeting on Wednesday with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump boasted about expanded use of force. \"They had one today in the Pacific. And the way I look at it, every time I look because it is violent and it is very — it's amazing, the weaponry,\" he said. \"They have these boats that go 45, 50 miles an hour in the water, and when you look at the accuracy and the power. Look, we have the greatest military in the world.\" He asserted that his actions are saving the lives of tens of thousands of Americans without providing evidence. He also said the U.S. may likely conduct strikes on land next. \"We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,\" he said. \"We're totally prepared to do that. And we'll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we're doing when we come to the land.\" Some lawmakers are raising concerns  The power to declare war rests with Congress, not the White House. After the al-Qaida attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress passed an authorization for use of military force, granting the president the ability to use the U.S. military against the terrorist group responsible for the attacks. The Trump administration has designated several South and Central American drug cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, but Congress has not authorized the use of force against them. Lawmakers — Democrats and some Republicans — have expressed concerns that the strikes on suspected drug boats violate domestic and international laws. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky charged that Trump has set a new precedent of shoot first, ask questions later. \"The idea of indiscriminately killing people without knowing their names, without seeing any evidence, without making a formal accusation or without collecting evidence,\" he said. \"It's kind of ironic that we think these people are so dangerous, we're going to kill them without any information.\" At the White House on Thursday, Trump said he thinks lawmakers will support his administration's efforts, but when asked why he wouldn't just ask Congress for a declaration of war, he said: \"I don't think we're going necessarily to ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK. We're going to kill them. They're going to be, like, dead.\" The Trump administration has given few specifics about its legal justification for the military strikes other than that the president is taking action under his Article II powers as commander in chief and as a defensive measure. In a notification to Congress last month, the administration said the president has determined that unspecified cartels are nonstate armed groups and that their actions amount to an \"armed attack\" on the United States. The administration also said Trump has determined that the U.S. is in an armed conflict with nonstate actors — cartels in South America — and that the Defense Department is conducting operations against them pursuant to the laws of armed conflict. Questions about the legality of the strikes  But legal experts say the administration's justification is full of holes. \"What this boils down to is the president of the United States asserting a prerogative to kill people based solely on his own say-so,\" said Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser for the State Department. Finucane, who is now with the International Crisis Group, says the pivotal legal conclusions \"are simply reached by executive fiat,\" thus \"making it permissible for the president to engage in premeditated killing.\" \"Outside of armed conflict, there is a word for the premeditated killing of people, and that word is 'murder,'\" he said. \"And just because the administration puts together this fig leaf of a legal justification does not legitimize these premeditated killings in the Caribbean.\" It's not just Venezuela that feels targeted. The latest strikes raised particular concerns in Colombia, which has coastlines on both the Caribbean and Pacific. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of murder and charged that some of the strikes killed Colombians. Trump responded by announcing that he would stop aid payments to Colombia. \"They're not going to get away with it much longer,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"We're not going to put up with it much longer. Colombia is very bad.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This week, a group of independent United Nations experts said even if the boats are transporting drugs, as the White House asserts, \"the use of lethal force in international waters without proper legal basis violates international law of the sea and amounts to extrajudicial executions.\" \"These moves are an extremely dangerous escalation with grave implications for peace and security in the Caribbean region,\" wrote the experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio largely listened as Trump sparred with reporters about his legal authority and allowing Congress to weigh in. When Trump turned to his top adviser on foreign policy for his thoughts, Rubio was blunt. \"Bottom line, these are drug boats,\" he said. \"If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.\" Claudia Grisales contributed reporting.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581463","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:14:00-20:00","title":"A Few Things to Consider Before Committing a Museum Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the motivations behind high-profile museum art heists, such as the recent theft of over $100 million in jewelry from the Louvre. While some speculate it was orchestrated by a distant criminal mastermind, experts like Christopher Marinello and veteran thief Myles Connor argue that such a scenario is unlikely. Instead, the real incentive lies in the economic potential of stealing jewelry—particularly diamond tiaras and emerald necklaces—because these can be broken up and resold as individual gems in cities like Tel Aviv or Antwerp. The relatively low penalties in both the U.S. and France, combined with weak museum security—especially for non-ticket-driving exhibits—make such thefts appealing.

October 23, 2025 • 4:14 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The glamorous image of art heists often conjures up Bond-villain masterminds orchestrating elaborate schemes. Laure Beccuau, the lead prosecutor in the recent Louvre case involving the theft of more than $100 million worth of historic jewelry, suggested in an  interview  on French news channel BFMTV this week that the job could be the work of organized crime or commissioned by a major \"sponsor.\" But lawyer Christopher Marinello, founder and CEO of  Art Recovery International , a London and Venice-based group specializing in tracking down stolen works of art, dismisses the latter Hollywood scenario. \"There have been questions about some sort of slippery Dr. No-type character who's ordering these thefts from afar for his personal collection in his underwater lair,\" said Marinello. \"But in 39 years of working on art recovery cases, I have never seen a theft-to-order case.\" Stealing art can, in fact, be far from lucrative. No reputable buyer will touch recognizable stolen pieces, which typically sell for just a fraction of their true value on the black market. \"If you steal a Picasso, you have to keep it a Picasso,\" Marinello said. \"It has to stay in one piece.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       However, Marinello said there's a much bigger upside to stealing diamond tiaras and emerald necklaces because they can be broken up and sold off as individual gems. \"That can be done as simply as sewing the stones inside a jacket, driving outside of France and going to a place like Tel Aviv or Antwerp where they have jewelry centers and experts who will recut larger stones into smaller stones,\" Marinello said. \"And then you've gotten away with the crime of the decade.\" Relatively light penalties add to the temptation. Stealing a major artwork from a U.S. museum carries a maximum 10-year sentence under  federal law  and a potential fine, with  similar penalties  in France. And many museums are also easy targets. \"For well-known pieces of artwork, because their black market value is so low, there's already very little incentive for criminals to go after those pieces,\" said  Frederick Chen , an economics professor at Wake Forest University who has co-authored a  paper  on the economics of art heists. \"And so there's less incentive for museums to invest in security.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Chen said museums are even less likely to protect artifacts that don't drive ticket sales. \"From the thieves' perspective, you already know the museum isn't going to have security that's going to be as strong as going to, say, a Tiffany's,\" Chen said. Myles Connor, an 82-year-old veteran  art thief  who stole a Rembrandt from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts in 1975 among other crimes and served substantial prison time, agrees museums are vulnerable. \"Most museums don't have armed guards,\" he said. \"And so if you're armed and determined, you can grab almost any painting out of almost any museum. And you can also do that with jewelry.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Connor says it's a bad idea to break up valuable jewelry, like pieces found in museums. \"If you break them up, you destroy the value of the items and you'd kind of be low-balling yourself,\" he said. Connor said there's a better way to cash out. \"When I stole paintings from museums, it was always with the intention of returning the painting and getting a reward.\" Connor said he received $50,000—about $300,000 in today's money—for returning the Rembrandt. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said he hopes the Louvre thieves will follow his playbook, adding \"I'm sure the reward will be substantial.\" The French government hasn't yet announced any reward – though some experts, including  Anthony Amore , the head of security and chief investigator at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, itself a  target  of art theft, have publicly  called  for it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Thieves stole more than a hundred million dollars in jewels from the Louvre a few days ago, but here's the thing - high-value museum pieces don't sell, like, loose diamonds from a jewelry shop. So why go through with it? NPR's Chloe Veltman explores why thieves still might take the risk. CHLOE VELTMAN, BYLINE: There's a glamorous notion that behind high-profile heists lies a nefarious master villain of the Dr. No variety. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DR. NO\") JOSEPH WISEMAN: (As Dr. Julius No) I escaped to America with 10 million of their dollars in gold. VELTMAN: Indeed, the lead prosecutor in the recent Louvre case, Laure Beccuau, said in an interview on the French news channel BFMTV this week the job could be the work of organized crime or done at the behest of a major sponsor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAURE BECCUAU: (Speaking French). VELTMAN: Christopher Marinello says this scenario seems unlikely. CHRISTOPHER MARINELLO: In 39 years of working on art recovery cases, I have never seen a theft-to-order case. VELTMAN: Marinello is a lawyer and the founder of Art Recovery International. The London- and Venice-based group specializes in tracking down stolen works of art. He says no reputable buyer will touch recognizable pieces, and they are likely to sell for a fraction of their true value on the black market. MARINELLO: If you steal a Picasso, you have to keep it a Picasso. It has to stay in one piece. VELTMAN: But Marinello says there's a much bigger upside to stealing diamond tiaras and emerald necklaces because you can break them up and sell off the gems individually. MARINELLO: That can be done as simply as sewing the stones inside a jacket and driving outside of France and going to a place like Tel Aviv or Antwerp. VELTMAN: ...Where there are experts who will recut the stones. MARINELLO: And then you've gotten away with the crime of the decade. VELTMAN: It also helps that penalties for stealing art can be pretty low. Theft of a major artwork from a U.S. museum carries a maximum 10-year sentence under federal law and a potential fine. Cases in France carry roughly similar penalties. And many museums are easy targets. Frederick Chen is a professor of economics at Wake Forest University. He's written a paper about the economics of art heists. FREDERICK CHEN: For well-known pieces of artwork, because their black market value is so low, there's already very little incentive for criminals to go after those pieces, and so that means there's less incentive for museums to invest in security. VELTMAN: Chen says museums are even less likely to protect artifacts that aren't key to ticket sales. CHEN: From the thieves' perspective, you already know the museum isn't going to have security that's going to be as strong as going to, like, a Tiffany's MYLES CONNOR: Most museums don't have armed guards. VELTMAN: This is veteran art thief Myles Connor. CONNOR: And so if you're armed and determined, you can grab most any painting out of almost any museum. And you can also do that with jewelry. VELTMAN: The 82-year-old, who stole a Rembrandt from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts in 1975, among other crimes for which he served substantial prison time, says it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the perpetrators of the Louvre heist to pick apart the items they stole. CONNOR: If you break them up, you'd destroy the value of the items. You'd kind of be lowballing yourself. VELTMAN: Connor says there's a better way to cash out. CONNOR: When I stole paintings from museums, it was always with the intention of returning the painting and getting a reward. VELTMAN: He says he got $50,000 for the return of the Rembrandts - that's about 300,000 in today's money - and hopes the Louvre thieves will follow his lead. The French government hasn't said anything about a reward yet. Chloe Veltman, NPR News.

It's the year of chewy, fruity Halloween treats \n         By Alina Selyukh \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 6:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Candy How has the price changed since before the pandemic? The price of chewing gum and candy has risen 38%   since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Why has the price gone up?  The cost of chocolate's main ingredient — cocoa — has nearly doubled since the beginning of last year, hitting historic records  again  and  again . That's because harvests of cocoa have come up short for three years straight. The vast majority of the world's cocoa beans grow in West Africa, where farmers have dealt with  extreme weather , changing climate patterns and disease in their aging trees. What are people doing about it?  All the major chocolate brands have raised their prices, including Nestlé, Lindt, Hershey and Mars, which makes M&Ms, Snickers and Twix. And they're resorting to tricks to make their treats, says David Branch, who tracks the cocoa market at Wells Fargo's Agri-Food Institute. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We're seeing a lot more fillers going in,\" Branch says. \"They're putting more nuts, less chocolate, keeping the price the same, just reducing the amount of cocoa cost.\" Reese's makes a Halloween-themed peanut butter cup called \"White Ghost\" that's dipped in \"white creme\" instead of chocolate. KitKat's Halloween flavors include cinnamony \"Ghost Toast\" and marshmallowy green-colored \"Witch's Brew,\" both very light on cocoa. And shoppers like Stephanie Espinosa are noticing another tactic. \"The bags for chocolate are definitely smaller now and there's less pieces,\" says Espinosa, whose town of Babcock Ranch, Fla., takes Halloween  very  seriously, with palm trees sprouting glowing eyeballs and ghosts haunting yards and porches. Shrinkflation has taken a gnarly bite out of Espinosa's budget, as she and her husband — in their best pirate chic — expect to \"Ahoy!\" at hundreds of trick-or-treaters. At that scale, chocolate prices hit with much more of a fright. And many shoppers feel that way. Enter: gummy, sour, fruity options. \"The mixed bags are definitely — you can see that there's less of the chocolate pieces in the mixes and more like SweeTARTS or gummies or things like that,\" says Espinosa, who begrudgingly switched to more affordable Tootsie Roll bags for this Halloween. Sales of non-chocolate candy have been growing  much faster  than those of chocolate in recent years. Retail data firm Circana finds that people are still spending more dollars on chocolate treats, but they're buying fewer of them. Overall, Halloween is still a splurgy holiday. The National Retail Federation  forecasts  that spending might surpass the 2023 record with an estimated $114.45 per shopper, as people see the higher prices but choose to let the ghoul times roll. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94586","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:12:00-20:00","title":"Vance Slams Israel's Parliament Vote on West Bank Annexation, Calling It an 'Insult'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Vice President JD Vance criticized Israel's Knesset vote on West Bank annexation, calling it an 'insult' and reaffirming the Trump administration’s opposition to the move.

     Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 8:12 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         JERUSALEM — U.S. Vice President JD Vance criticized Thursday Israel's parliament vote on West Bank annexation, saying it amounted to an \"insult.\" Vance's scathing remark came as his visit wrapped up Thursday and after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would now be traveling to Israel. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Vance's words and the intense diplomacy indicate that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was intent on keeping up the momentum on the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Speaking on the tarmac of Tel Aviv's international airport before departing Israel, Vance said that if the Knesset vote was a \"political stunt, then it is a very stupid political stunt.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I personally take some insult to it,\" Vance said. \"The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.\" An intense U.S. push toward peace Earlier this week, Vance announced the opening of a civilian military coordination center in southern Israel where some 200 U.S. troops are working alongside the Israeli military and delegations from other countries planning the stabilization and reconstruction of Gaza. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Rubio told journalists at Joint Base Andrews late Wednesday that he plans to visit the center and appoint a Foreign Service official to work alongside the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper. The U.S. is seeking support from other allies, especially Gulf Arab nations, to create an international stabilization force to be deployed to Gaza and train a Palestinian force. \"We'd like to see Palestinian police forces in Gaza that are not Hamas and that are going to do a good job, but those still have to be trained and equipped,\" he said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Rubio also criticized efforts by far-right politicians in the Israeli parliament who on Wednesday took the symbolic step of giving preliminary approval to a bill that would give Israel authority to annex the occupied West Bank — a move the U.S. opposes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump \"has made clear that's not something we'd be supportive of right now, and we think it's potentially threatening to the peace deal,\" he said. The bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether the bill has support to win a majority in the 120-seat parliament, and Netanyahu has tools to delay or defeat it. Vance visits Holy Sepulcher Meanwhile, Vance visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the sprawling 12th century basilica where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, died and rose again, in Jerusalem's Old City. He is then expected to meet Israel's Defense Minister, Israeli military leaders and other officials at the army's headquarters in Tel Aviv. On Wednesday, Vance sought to ease concerns that the Trump administration was dictating terms to its closest ally in the Middle East. \"We don't want in Israel a vassal state, and that's not what Israel is. We want a partnership, we want an ally,\" Vance said, speaking beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in response to a reporter's question about whether Israel was becoming a \"protectorate\" of the U.S. Netanyahu, who will meet with Rubio as well, expressed similar sentiments while acknowledging differences of opinion as they push forward the U.S.-proposed ceasefire agreement. Israeli media referred to the nonstop parade of American officials visiting to ensure Israel holds up its side of the fragile ceasefire as \"Bibi-sitting.\" The term, utilizing Netanyahu's nickname of Bibi, refers to an old campaign ad when Netanyahu positioned himself as the \"Bibi-sitter\" whom voters could trust with their kids. Palestinians in Gaza in dire need of medical care In the first medical evacuation since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, the head of the World Health Organization said Thursday they had evacuated 41 critical patients and 145 companions out of the Gaza strip. In a statement posted to X, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on nations to show solidarity and help some 15,000 patients who are still waiting for approval to receive medical care outside Gaza. His calls were echoed by an official with the U.N. Population Fund who, on Wednesday, described the \"sheer devastation\" that he witnessed on his most recent travel to Gaza, saying that there is no such thing as a \"normal birth in Gaza now.\" Andrew Saberton, an executive director at UNFPA, told reporters how difficult the agency's work has become due to the lack of functioning or even standing health care facilities. \"I was not fully prepared for what I saw. One can't be. The sheer extent of the devastation looked like the set of a dystopian film. Unfortunately, it is not fiction,\" he said. Saberton added that Palestinian women cannot get access to a hospital. \"They often don't even have access to a private space in a tent. We have stories of women giving birth actually in the rubble, beside the road,\" he said. Court hearing on journalists' access to Gaza Separately on Thursday, Israel's Supreme Court held a hearing into whether to open the Gaza Strip to the international media and gave the state 30 days to present a new position in light of the new situation under the ceasefire. Israel has blocked reporters from entering Gaza since the war erupted on Oct 7, 2023. The Foreign Press Association, which represents dozens of international news organizations including The Associated Press, had asked the court to order the government to open the border. In a statement after Thursday's decision, the FPA expressed its \"disappointment\" and called the Israeli government's position to deny journalists access \"unacceptable.\" The court rejected a request from the FPA early in the war, due to objections by the government on security grounds. The group filed a second request for access in September 2024. The government has repeatedly delayed the case. Palestinian journalists have covered the two-year war for international media. But like all Palestinians, they have been subject to tough restrictions on movement and shortages of food, repeatedly displaced and operated under great danger. Some 200 Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israeli fire, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. \"It is time for Israel to lift the closure and let us do our work alongside our Palestinian colleagues,\" said Tania Kraemer, chairperson of the FPA. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/miami-heat-terry-rozier-gambling-probe-de98ecb76bb8f13b85f4c5ac62f66221","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:31:26+00:00","title":"Arrests of Trail Blazers Coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat’s Terry Rozier in Sports Betting Case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NBA is at the center of a massive federal investigation into alleged sports betting fraud involving insider information and Mafia-linked gambling.

latest updates on  the arrests of Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and the Miami Heat’s Terry Rozier in a sports betting case \n    \n \n NEW YORK (AP) — The head coach of the  Portland Trail Blazers  and a player for the  Miami Heat  were arrested Thursday along with more than 30 other people in a takedown of two sprawling gambling operations that authorities said leaked inside information about NBA athletes and rigged poker games backed by Mafia families. Portland coach  Chauncey Billups  was charged with participating in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games tied to La Cosa Nostra organized crime families that cheated unsuspecting gamblers out of at least $7 million. Heat guard  Terry Rozier  was accused in a separate scheme of  exploiting private information  about players to win bets on NBA games. The two indictments unsealed in New York create a massive cloud for the NBA — which opened its season this week — and show how certain types of wagers are  vulnerable to massive fraud  in the growing, multibillion-dollar  legal sports-betting industry . Joseph Nocella, the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of New York, called it “one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalized in the United States.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “My message to the defendants who’ve been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,” Nocella said. “Your luck has run out.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Stephen Curry’s heroics overshadow Aaron Gordon’s 50-point night in Warriors’ OT win \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Stephen Curry’s 42 points lift Warriors over Nuggets in thrilling 137-131 OT win \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Sports betting is a booming business.

Billups, who was inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame  last year, had about $106 million in earnings over his 17-year career. Rozier made about $160 million in his stops in Boston, Miami and Charlotte. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Billups and Rozier have been placed on leave from their teams, according to the NBA, which said it is cooperating with authorities. “We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,” the NBA said in a statement. Hours after his arrest, Rozier appeared in a federal court in Orlando, Florida, wearing a Charlotte Hornets sweatshirt, handcuffs and shackles. Billups appeared before a judge in Portland, Oregon. Both men were ordered released from custody on certain conditions.  Billups’ attorney, Chris Heywood, issued a statement Thursday evening denying the allegations, calling his client a “man of integrity.” “To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his Hall-of-Fame legacy, his reputation and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game,” Heywood said. Rozier’s lawyer, Jim Trusty, said in a statement that his client is “not a gambler” and “looks forward to winning this fight.” Trusty criticized authorities for not allowing his client to surrender on his own and accused officials of wanting “the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Messages were left Thursday at a phone number and email address listed in public records for Jones. Roughly 20 other defendants appeared in federal court in Brooklyn, where most of them pleaded not guilty. Many of those charged with violent crimes or with lengthy criminal records and ties to organized crime were detained. Mafia families profited off gambling scheme, officials say The poker scheme lured unwitting players into rigged games with the chance to compete against former professional basketball players like Billups and Jones. The games were fixed using sophisticated cheating technology, such as altered card-shuffling machines, hidden cameras in poker chip trays, special sunglasses and even X-ray equipment built into the table to read cards, authorities allege. The scheme often made use of illegal poker games run by New York crime families that required them to share a portion of their proceeds with the Gambino, Genovese and Bonnano crime families, according to court papers. Members of those families, in turn, also helped commit violent acts, including assault, extortion and robbery, to ensure repayment of debts and the continued success of the operation, officials said in court documents. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Athletes accused of leaving games early In the sports betting scheme, Rozier and other defendants are accused of accessing private information from NBA players or coaches that could affect a player’s performance and giving that information to others so they could place wagers. Players sometimes altered their performance or took themselves out of games early to rig prop bets — a type of wager that allows gamblers to bet on whether a player will exceed a certain statistic, such as a total number of points, rebounds or assists, according to the indictment. In one instance, Rozier, while playing for the  Charlotte Hornets  in 2023, told people he was planning to leave the game early with a supposed injury, allowing gamblers to place wagers earning them tens of thousands of dollars, authorities said. That game against the  New Orleans Pelicans  raised eyebrows at the time. Rozier played the first 9 minutes and 36 seconds of the game before leaving, citing a foot issue. He did not play again that season. Posts still online from March 23, 2023, show that some bettors were furious with sportsbooks that evening when it became evident that Rozier was not going to return to the game after the first quarter, with many turning to social media to say that something “shady” had happened regarding the prop bets involving his stats for that night. The indictments contain the descriptions of several unnamed NBA players whose injury status and availability for certain games were the source of betting activity. Those players are not accused of any wrongdoing, and there is no indication that they would have even known what was being said about their status for those games. Those players include  LeBron James ,  Anthony Davis  and  Damian Lillard . Their identities are clear based on a review of corresponding injury reports surrounding games mentioned in the indictment. The indictments show that certain defendants shared information about the availability of those players in a game on March 24, 2023, involving the Portland Trail Blazers, and two games in 2023 and 2024 involving the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA had investigated Rozier previously. He was in uniform as  the Heat played the Magic  on Wednesday in Orlando, Florida, in the season opener for both teams, though he did not play in the game. ___ Durkin Richer reported from Washington, and Reynolds reported from Miami.

(AP) — President  Donald Trump  said Thursday that he’s backing off a planned surge of  federal agents into San Francisco  to quell crime after speaking to the mayor and several prominent business leaders who said they’re working hard to clean up the city. Trump had been threatening to send the National Guard to San Francisco, a move Mayor Daniel Lurie and Gov. Gavin Newsom said was unnecessary because crime is on the decline. Separately, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at a Coast Guard base in the region earlier Thursday for a possible ramp up of immigration enforcement, a move that drew several hundred protesters. It was not clear if the president was canceling a National Guard deployment or calling off  immigration enforcement  by CBP agents. At his news conference, Lurie said he could not clarify and could only repeat what the president had told him. Lurie said Homeland Security Secretary  Kristi Noem  “reaffirmed” Trump’s commitment on Thursday morning. DHS oversees CBP agents as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The Federal Government was preparing to ‘surge’ San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump posted on social media. “I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump says tech leaders and mayor changed his mind about using federal force in San Francisco \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 California union proposes taxing billionaires to offset Medicaid cuts \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Deadly semitrailer crash in California renews federal criticism of immigrant truck drivers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Specifically, Trump said he heard from Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

Several hundred people stood outside the facility, with many singing hymns and carrying signs saying, “Protect our neighbors” and “No ICE or troops in the Bay.”  Police used at least one flash-bang grenade to clear a handful of demonstrators from the entrance as CBP vehicles drove onto the base.

The island is owned by the federal government and is not open to the general public, so escorts or specific government ID cards are required for visitors. The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Trump has deployed the Guard to  Washington, D.C. , and  Memphis ,  Tennessee , to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against immigration arrests. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}(); \n\n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He has also said they are needed in  Chicago  and  Portland , Oregon.

Instead of mirrors or guys in the corner peeking over shoulders, there were X-ray tables and high-tech contact lenses. Low-tech signals between players and old-fashioned beatings for debtors allegedly were used too.  Here’s a look at how the alleged fraudsters rigged the games, according to an unsealed indictment and the announcement from federal officials.  The poker  The underground games were illegal by their very existence, and operated by mafia families. So the indictments go out of their way to emphasize that these were extra illegal — as opposed to “straight” illegal games where at least the poker itself is legit.  Texas Hold ’em  was the poker they played, like most games these days. It involves very few cards — just five face-up public cards and two for each player. That potentially simplifies the scamming.  \n    \n     ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n The victims and the ‘face cards’  Rich targets known as “fish” were brought in by the allure of playing for high stakes in posh secret spots in Manhattan with names like “The Lexington Avenue Game,” the indictment said. They were also attracted by the prospect of playing with pro athletes and coaches, including  Portland Trail Blazers  coach and Hall-of-Fame NBA player Chauncey Billups. The operators called these “face cards.”  Billups  was charged with participating in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games tied to La Cosa Nostra organized crime families that cheated unsuspecting gamblers out of at least $7 million. Also charged was former NBA assistant coach and player Damon Jones. Authorities gave no hints about the identity of the victims other than to say they were usually wealthy people who lost tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cheaters. The “face cards” and everyone else at the table who was not a target was in on the scam.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The cheating tactics  The shuffling machine did most of the work. Using machines is common, but the advanced tech on these ones could determine the exact order of cards after a shuffle, and who was holding what once they were dealt. That information was transmitted wirelessly to someone off-site, who would send the identity of the player with the winning hand to the phone of a player at the table, known as “the quarterback.”  Then it got low-tech. The “quarterback” would use classic subtle signals like touching certain chips to pass the information to the fellow cheaters. They’d all bet accordingly.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The other cheating methods  The shuffling machine con was apparently the main tactic, but the conspirators supposedly tried other gadgetry, some of it similar to the tech used to identify players’ hands on poker telecasts. Authorities didn’t go into detail about them, but they included:  -An X-ray table that could identify the face-down cards used in Texas Hold ‘em from underneath.  -Hidden cameras built into the trays that hold players’ chips that could identify cards.  -Customized contact lenses and glasses that could detect special marks on cards.  The postgame  The cheating winners would share a percentage of their take with the game operators. The victims were often told to wire money to shell companies that laundered it. And the organizers sometimes used robbery, extortion and assault to get debtors to pay. Authorities said two game operators used their fists to extract payment from one cheated player.  Also charged was former NBA assistant coach and player Damon Jones, who stands accused of participating in a  separate scheme of exploiting private information  about players to win bets on NBA games.  Billups made his first court appearance Thursday before a judge in Portland, Oregon. His attorney, Chris Heywood, declined to comment after the hearing.  A message was left at a phone number and email address listed in public records for Jones. ___ This story has been corrected to show the public cards in Texas Hold ‘em are dealt face-up, not face-down."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5583614","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:32:00-20:32","title":"NBA Coach Chauncey Billups, Player Terry Rozier Arrested in FBI Gambling Probe","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NBA figures Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier, and former player Damon Jones were arrested by the FBI in connection with two major illegal gambling schemes.

Sullivan \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 10:32 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones were arrested Thursday over their alleged participation in two major illegal gambling schemes — one involving bets placed on NBA games, the other involving underground poker games — investigated  by the FBI . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Federal prosecutors say the two schemes were organized in part by New York crime families and involved hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal, fraudulent wagers. More than 30 people were arrested in eleven states on Thursday, and more are expected to surrender themselves later, Justice Department officials said. \"This is an illegal gambling operation and sports-rigging operation that spanned the course of years,\" said  FBI director Kash Patel  at a Thursday press conference. \"The fraud is mind-boggling. It's not hundreds of dollars. It's not thousands of dollars. It's not even millions of dollars. We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation.\" One indictment —  United States vs. Earnest, et al.  — involved a scheme to place bets on NBA games based on non-public information, such as when a player planned to pull himself out of a game due to injury or illness. Working with organized crime groups, NBA \"insiders\" such as Rozier and Jones would pass along confidential information in exchange for some of the proceeds, said Joseph Nocella, the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. \"They relied on corrupt individuals, including Jones and Rozier. They also used misused information obtained during long-standing friendships they had with NBA players and coaches,\" he said. The indictment highlights seven games in 2023 and 2024 on which hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of illegal bets were allegedly placed. Insider tips came to gamblers from connections on five teams, including two then-active players: Rozier, who at the time played for the Charlotte Hornets, and Jontay Porter, then a player with the Toronto Raptors who was  banned for life  from the NBA last year due to his involvement in gambling.  Other tips came from Jones, the former Cavaliers player and coach who was serving as an \"unofficial\" assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers during the spring of 2023, the indictment says. Jones allegedly sold or attempted to sell non-public information about player injuries to gamblers.   Other insiders, including a Trail Blazers coach and an Orlando Magic player, allegedly provided information to gamblers but were not named in the indictment. The second indictment, called  United States vs. Aiello , involved a series of rigged poker games arranged by organized crime groups in New York. Victims were induced to participate in the games with the promise of playing against prominent former athletes, including Billups and Jones, Nocella said. Then, using a variety of cheating technology — including rigged shuffling machines and an x-ray poker table designed to reveal the victims' hidden cards — the crime groups would cheat the victims out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game, the indictment alleges. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Victims lost at least $7 million in the rigged games, officials say. Other defendants include the games' organizers, suppliers of the cheating equipment and others who allegedly played in the rigged games — including Billups, who participated in a series of games in 2019 in Las Vegas, according to the indictment.  Billups and Rozier each face one count of wire fraud conspiracy and one count of money laundering conspiracy. Jones, who allegedly participated in both schemes, faces two counts of each charge. Billups, 49, played in the NBA for 17 years, winning a title with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. He was  named coach  of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2021 and was elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame last year. Jones, also 49, played for ten different teams over the course of his NBA career from 1998 through 2009, including three seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Billups and Rozier, 31, are expected to appear in federal court later Thursday, Billups in Portland and Rozier in Orlando. They will be arraigned in New York at a future date, said DOJ spokesperson John Marzulli. James Trusty, a lawyer representing Rozier, told NPR in a statement that the player's arrest on Thursday had come as a surprise, as prosecutors had previously communicated to them that Rozier was \"a subject, not a target\" of their investigation. \"It is unfortunate that instead of allowing him to self surrender they opted for a photo op. They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case,\" Trusty said. \"Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2023, when Rozier played for the Charlotte Hornets, the NBA was alerted to \"unusual betting activity\" related to his performance in a March game against the New Orleans Pelicans, the NBA said  in a statement earlier this year . Rozier logged five points, four rebounds and two assists in the first quarter of that game before exiting with what the team described as \"foot discomfort.\" All those totals were well below his season averages, and all of them were under the betting lines set by sportsbooks for proposition wagers. Rozier did not play again that season. He was later traded to the Miami Heat. At the time, the NBA conducted an investigation and did not find any wrongdoing, the league said this year. Meanwhile, the federal investigation had proceeded separately. In the unsealed indictment, Rozier is accused of telling a friend, Deniro Laster, ahead of time that he planned to exit the game early so that Laster could place a bet on the game. Laster then sold that information to other gamblers for $100,000, the indictment alleges, leading to more than a quarter-million dollars worth of bets being placed on the \"under\" in proposition bets involving Rozier's performance. Federal officials said Thursday that the NBA had cooperated with the investigation. In  a statement , the NBA said the league \"will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities\" and that Billups and Rozier had been placed on leave. \"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains a top priority,\" the statement said. Chris Heywood who represented Billups during his Thursday court appearance released a statement Thursday saying that Chauncey Billups would never risk doing what the US government is accusing him of doing, that it would \"risk his hall of fame legacy, his reputation and his freedom\".  The statement concluded:  \"Chauncey Billups has never backed down. He does not plan to do so now. He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court.\"    It was not immediately clear who was representing Jones. Prosecutors said another former NBA player, Jontay Porter, had been involved in the organized gambling operation. Porter was banned for life by the NBA in 2024 after an investigation revealed he had manipulated his performances for the Toronto Raptors in two games that year. Later that year, he pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the scheme. Porter is set to be sentenced in December. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Three current and former NBA players, including the Hall of Famer and current head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, Chauncey Billups, were arrested today in connection with a major illegal gambling investigation by the FBI. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KASH PATEL: Look, let's not, you know, minced words. This is the insider trading saga for the NBA. That's what this is. CHANG: At a press conference, FBI Director Kash Patel described two major gambling schemes. One involved bets on NBA games using confidential information about player health, and the other involved underground poker games organized by the mob who allegedly used former NBA stars to attract people who were then cheated out of their money. NPR sports correspondent Becky Sullivan is here to explain these alleged schemes. Hi, Becky. BECKY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Hey there. CHANG: OK. So let's start with the NBA betting scheme. What are the allegations exactly? SULLIVAN: Yeah. I mean, basically, according to the indictment, this involved - they named seven NBA games from a couple seasons ago in which an NBA insider, they say, gave nonpublic information to gamblers to gamble on them, basically. So in the case of one of the current, active player - his name is Terry Rozier. He plays for the Heat - Miami Heat now, but at the time he played for the Charlotte Hornets. According to the indictment, he told a friend that he had planned to pull out of a game in March 2023 - planned to pull out early due to an injury. That friend allegedly sold the information to gamblers for $100,000. And here is New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch speaking at this morning's press conference, describing what happened next. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JESSICA TISCH: Using that information, members of the group placed more than $200,000 in wagers on his under statistics. Rozier exited the game after just nine minutes, and those bets paid out, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profit. The proceeds were later delivered to his home, where the group counted their cash. CHANG: Wow. How many others were involved in that scheme... SULLIVAN: Well... CHANG: ...Allegedly? SULLIVAN: Yeah. I mean, over the two schemes, officials say that more than 30 people were arrested. That includes gamblers, includes members of organized crime groups. In terms of people involved with the NBA, another person who was arrested was Damon Jones. He's a former NBA player and coach who, at the time, in 2023, was working as an unofficial coach for the Los Angeles Lakers. He leaked info that LeBron James was going to sit out with a sore ankle. Some other games included a Toronto Raptors player named Jontay Porter, who was banned for life from the league last year over his involvement in gambling. There are a couple other coconspirators described as NBA insiders who are not named in the indictment. It appears that one could be Chauncey Billups, which means that I think maybe more fallout could be coming. CHANG: But Becky, hadn't the NBA investigated some of this before? SULLIVAN: Yeah. That's why Porter was banned last year. For Rozier, the NBA investigated when this happened back in 2023 and actually cleared him then, which is something that his lawyer pointed out to me today. His lawyer says that Terry's not a gambler, said, quote, \"he is not afraid of a fight,\" looks forward to winning this one. Billups and Jones don't yet, by the way - I should say - have lawyers filed with the case information just yet. CHANG: OK. What about the other investigation, the poker games? SULLIVAN: Yeah. This was related to these - yeah - underground poker games that were organized by crime families. The prosecutors say that, you know, in terms of the former NBA players, like Chauncey Billups, who was explicitly named in this one, they were recruited to play as basically, as you say, a way to lure in victims. Of course, then the games were rigged. They actually used some crazy high tech to do that, rigged shuffling machines. X-ray poker tables were named in the indictment. In total, the victims here lost more than $7 million. CHANG: Can you just put all of this in perspective for us? Like, how big a deal are these different alleged schemes? SULLIVAN: I mean, the NBA stuff is a very big deal. Pro leagues used to be very outspoken against gambling, but the Supreme Court effectively legalized sports gambling nationwide back in 2018. Since then, it's become infused in every part of the sports ecosystem. You can't watch a game now without hearing analysts talking about how to bet, so on. CHANG: Yeah. SULLIVAN: It's everywhere. I think everybody in sports has been waiting for a big scandal like this to drop, and now here we are. CHANG: That is NPR's Becky Sullivan. Thank you, Becky. SULLIVAN: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/lithuania-russia-military-planes-airspace-f9d31aa920ee91c95103d902967d3b24","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:06:20Z","title":"Russian military planes briefly violate Lithuanian airspace, Lithuania says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On 2025-10-23, Russian military aircraft, including a Su-30 fighter jet and an IL-78 refueling aircraft, briefly entered Lithuanian airspace near the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, prompting President Gitanas Nausėda to condemn the action as a clear violation of international law and territorial integrity.

Lithuanian president said, condemning what he called a blatant breach of the territorial integrity of his European Union and NATO-member country.

It said in a statement that Su-30 fighter jets on Thursday conducted training flights over the Kaliningrad region in strict compliance with the rules. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The aircraft did not deviate from their flight route or violate the borders of other states, as confirmed by objective monitoring means,” the ministry said.

part of its effort to support federal efforts to track down immigrants in the country illegally and provide border and maritime security. The San Francisco Chronicle,  citing an anonymous source with knowledge of the operation, reported more than 100 CBP and other federal agents will begin arriving Thursday at the base in Alameda, a move immediately condemned by San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and California Gov.

Trump recently renewed his musings about sending the Guard to San Francisco, saying in a Fox News interview Sunday that the city “was truly one of the great cities of the world” before it went “wrong” and “woke.”  His assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 has baffled local and state leaders who  point to statistics  showing that many crimes are at record lows. Newsom’s administration said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the guard into Los Angeles against the governor’s wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to “be in court within hours, if not minutes” if there is a federal deployment, and San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu has promised the same. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n At a news conference Wednesday, Newsom held up what he said was a lawsuit the state would file if Trump sends troops to San Francisco. “We’re going to be fierce in terms of our response,” said Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco. “This is the lawsuit that I will file within a nanosecond of any efforts to send the military to one of America’s great cities.” The Coast Guard base in Alameda that is hosting the CBP agents is between Oakland and San Francisco, both sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the federal government on civil immigration operations. A Homeland Security statement said the agency is “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.” Lurie urged the public to protest peacefully. He said he had just signed an executive directive to coordinate the city’s response to a potential federal deployment and provide support for immigrants. Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee issued a statement saying: “Real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.” ___ Associated Press writer Sophie Austin contributed from Sacramento, California"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5583959","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-04:00","title":"Trump plows ahead with East Wing demolition despite calls for caution","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald J.

A White House official not authorized to speak on the record tells NPR the demolition phase of President Trump's project to build a 90,000 square foot ballroom, is ahead of schedule. Although Trump initially said the project wouldn't \"interfere with the current building\" and would be \"near it but not touching it,\" he explained Wednesday that \"in order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure.\" The East Wing demolition, the White House official said, is going directly up to the edge of the residence and includes tearing down the East Garden Room, Family Theater and East Colonnade, as well as the complex of offices. The sight of excavators tearing into the East Wing set off alarms among preservationists, but the White House is doubling down, insisting the demolition is necessary. \"The plans changed, and the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this Phase 1 that we're now in was necessary,\" said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, in a briefing on Thursday. \"The president wants to do right by the People's House.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The offices and other facilities that were in the East Wing will be rebuilt and modernized, said Leavitt. There will also be security enhancements involving the underground bunker built under the East Wing during World War II, known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. The East Wing will \"be more beautiful and modern than ever before,\" said Leavitt. \"And in addition, there will be a big, beautiful ballroom that can hold big parties and state visits for generations to come.\" Going back at least to the year 2010, Trump has complained that the White House doesn't have an appropriate space for State Dinners and other large gatherings, often requiring large tents to be set up on the South Lawn. When it was first announced over the summer, the White House said the project would cost $200 million. Costs have already ballooned, with the president now describing it as a $300 million project, which the White House says will all still be funded by private donors. In a letter earlier this week, The National Trust for Historic Preservation called on the Trump administration to pause demolition until the ballroom plans go through \"the legally required public review processes,\" which includes input and approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. \"We are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,\" the letter said. In  a social media post by Steven Cheung , White House director of communications, said The National Trust for Historic Preservation is \"run by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games.\" A fact sheet released by the White House slammed criticisms as \"manufactured outrage\" by \"unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies\" who are \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House.\" In a statement to NPR, the White House Historical Association said it created a historic record of the East Wing prior to the demolition through digital scans and photographs. \"The East Wing and gardens have been captured in detail for the benefit of our nation and historic artifacts from the East Wing have been preserved and stored,\" the statement read. But the White House has not yet submitted construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the agency tasked with approving major renovations and construction projects on federal grounds in Washington, D.C. The White House official said they do not have a timeline for submitting the plans, but do intend to seek approval before the construction phase begins. Will Scharff, a top Trump aide and chair of the commission, said during a public commission meeting in September that the commission doesn't have jurisdiction over demolition, therefore it did not need to approve Trump's plan to tear down the East Wing to make way for the ballroom. \"Any assertion that this commission should have been consulted earlier than it has been or that it will be is simply false and represents a misunderstanding of this commission's role in that project,\" Scharff said. \"When we are submitted a plan, we will review that plan.\" The commission is currently closed due to the government shutdown and their October meeting has been canceled. Preston Bryant, the former chair of the commission for nine years and appointed by then-President Barack Obama and Trump during his first term, doesn't agree with Scharff's assertion over jurisdiction. In an email to NPR, Bryant said the commission's review and approval process includes the entire project design. \"In that process, what's demolished would be part of the project plan to be reviewed and approved. What's demolished is inherent in the design. Site preparation also is inherent in the design,\" he said. The ballroom has a hefty price tag attached to it. Trump said during a meeting on Wednesday that the project will cost around $300 million. That's up from previous estimates of $200 to $250 million. But Trump claims the ballroom is exclusively paid for by himself and private donors. The White House official said the project has secured $200 million in donations so far and provided a list of donors to NPR. The donors include big names like Amazon, Google, Meta and Lockheed Martin. Here's the full list of donors, provided by the official:  Altria Group Inc. Amazon Apple Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.

Charles III and Queen Camilla prayed Thursday with Pope Leo XIV in an historic visit to the Vatican to  forge closer relations  between the Church of England and the Catholic Church, a welcome spiritual respite for the royals from the turmoil at home over  sexual misconduct allegations against Prince Andrew . Charles, who is the titular head of the Church of England, and Camilla sat in golden thrones on the raised altar of the Sistine Chapel, in front of Michelangelo’s “Last Judgment,” while Leo and the Anglican archbishop of York presided over an ecumenical service. The event marked the first time since the Reformation that the heads of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests, have prayed together. The accompanying music reflected the Catholic and Anglican musical heritage: Hymns were sung by members of both the Sistine Chapel choir and visiting members of two royal choirs: the St. George’s Chapel choir of Windsor Castle and the children’s choir of the Chapel Royal of St. James’s Palace. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Author Michael Wolff sues Melania Trump, saying she threatened $1B suit over Epstein-related claims \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Lawsuit seeks to force swearing in of US Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump-endorsed candidate enters race to challenge Republican Rep.

The scandal that has long dogged the king’s brother was reignited this week after a memoir by Epstein and Andrew accuser  Virginia Giuffre  was published. The 65-year-old prince has said he will  stop using his titles , including Duke of York, but has “vigorously” denied Giuffre’s claims. Buckingham Palace and the U.K. government are under pressure to formally strip Andrew of his dukedom and princely title, and kick him out of the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he lives. Charles’ and Camilla’s visit had actually been planned for earlier this year, but was rescheduled after Pope Francis got sick and then died. Charles had strongly wanted to visit the Vatican during the 2025 Holy Year, a once-every-quarter-century celebration of Christianity. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Step toward unity Anglicans split from the Catholic Church in 1534 when English King Henry VIII was refused a marriage annulment. While popes for decades have forged warm relations with the Church of England and the broader Anglican Communion on a path toward greater unity, the two churches remain divided. The Sistine Chapel service, though, marked a historic new step toward unity and included readings and prayers focused on the unifying theme of God the creator.  Later Thursday, Charles traveled to a pontifical basilica that has strong, traditional ties to the Church of England, St. Paul’s Outside the Walls, to receive a new formal recognition. The title “Royal Confrater” is a sign of spiritual fellowship and was reciprocated by Charles: Leo was given the title of “Papal Confrater of St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.” At the basilica, Charles sat in a special chair decorated with his coat of arms, bearing the Latin exhortation “Ut Unum Sint” (That they may be one), the mantra for Christian unity. The chair was given to him and will remain in the basilica for Charles and his heirs to use, officials said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, said that the king’s visit strengthens the relationship forged by Queen Elizabeth II, who came to Rome six times during her reign, including during the 2000 Holy Year. “Pope Leo and King Charles coming together before God in prayer is an example of a genuine and profound cooperation,” he told The Associated Press. He recalled that Charles accepted his constitutional role as supreme governor of the Church of England, “but also his role in protecting freedom of religion and the important role of faith in society across his kingdom.” The visit comes just weeks after the election of the first female  archbishop of Canterbury , Sarah Mullally. She didn’t join the king and queen at the Vatican, since she hasn’t been formally installed as the Church of England’s spiritual leader. In her place was the archbishop of York, the Most Rev. Stephen Cottrell. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Anglican Communion strains While the king copes with tensions over the Epstein scandal at home, Mullally’s election has heightened tensions within the Anglican Communion abroad. The archbishop of Canterbury is considered the “first among equals” in the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members spread across 165 countries. But following Mullally’s appointment, a long-building schism in the Anglican Communion appears close to a final rupture. An organization of conservative Anglican primates — representing a majority of the communion’s membership, primarily in Africa — announced that it’s rejecting all of the bureaucratic links that have historically connected the Anglican Communion. The Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans, known as Gafcon, says it’s forming a new structure, although it claims it represents the historic Anglican Communion in a “reordered” form. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Its statement denounced the LGBTQ-affirming stances of some parts of the Anglican Communion as precipitating the break, a reference to positions taken by the Church of England and the Episcopal Church in the United States. But it closely followed another Gafcon statement lamenting Mullally’s appointment, saying that many believe that only men can be bishops and rejecting her office as a defining point of Anglican unity. ___ Peter B.

killing three people in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, expanding the Trump administration’s  campaign against drug trafficking in South America . It followed another strike Tuesday night, also in the eastern Pacific, that killed two people, Hegseth posted on social media hours earlier. The attacks were departures from the seven previous U.S. strikes that  had targeted vessels  in the Caribbean Sea. They bring the death toll to at least 37 from attacks that began last month. The strikes represent an expansion of the military’s targeting area as well as a shift to the waters off South America where much of the cocaine from the world’s largest producers is smuggled. Hegseth’s social media posts also drew a  direct comparison between the war on terrorism  that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration’s crackdown. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding “there will be no refuge or forgiveness — only justice.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 EU accuses Meta and TikTok of breaching transparency rules \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump’s favorability has fallen among Hispanics since January, a new AP-NORC poll finds \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Turkey in talks with Qatar and Oman to buy used Eurofighter jets, Erdogan says \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Later Wednesday, he referred to the alleged drug-runners as “the ‘Al Qaeda’ of our hemisphere.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Republican President Donald Trump has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in  an “armed conflict” with drug cartels  and proclaiming the criminal organizations unlawful combatants, relying on the same legal authority used by President George W.

And we’ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we’re doing when we come to the land.” Lawmakers from both political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details.  Appearing alongside Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended such strikes, saying, “If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump said the strikes he is ordering are meant to save Americans and “the only way you can’t feel bad about it ... is that you realize that every time you see that happen, you’re saving 25,000 lives.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen as Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025, in Washington.

Several seconds into the video, the boat explodes and is seen floating motionless on the water in flames. The second video shows another boat moving quickly before being struck by an explosion. Video apparently recorded after the explosion shows packages floating in the water. The U.S. military has built up an unusually large  force in the Caribbean Sea  and the waters off the coast of Venezuela since this summer, raising speculation that Trump  could try to topple  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Maduro faces  charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S. In his posts on the strikes, Trump has repeatedly argued that illegal narcotics and the drug fentanyl carried by the vessels have been poisoning Americans. While the bulk of American overdose deaths are from fentanyl, the drug is transported by land from Mexico. Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, but the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean, is the primary area for smuggling cocaine. Colombia  and Peru, countries with coastlines on the eastern Pacific, are the world’s top cocaine producers.  Wedged between them is Ecuador , whose world-class ports and myriad maritime shipping containers filled with bananas have become the perfect vehicle for drug traffickers to move their product. The administration has  sidestepped prosecuting any occupants  of alleged drug-running vessels after returning two survivors of an earlier strike to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ecuadorian officials later said  they released the man who was returned because they had no evidence he committed a crime in their country. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listens as President Donald Trump speaks before a lunch with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Washington.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was alarmed and angry about a lack of information on the strikes. “Expanding the geography simply expands the lawlessness and the recklessness in the use of the American military without seeming legal or practical justification,” Blumenthal said. He said the way to target trafficking would be stopping the boats and interrogating those aboard to find the source of the drugs, “not just destroy the smugglers who are likely to be at the bottom of the smuggling chain.” The Republican-controlled Senate recently  voted down  a Democratic-sponsored  war powers  resolution, mostly along party lines, that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes. Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he’s met with Rubio. “He has researched the legal ramifications carefully and he believes we’re on solid ground in attacking these narcoterrorists,” Kennedy said. “I trust his judgment.” ___ Associated Press writers Will Weissert and Kevin Freking in Washington and Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/maine-platner-senate-trump-mills-tattoo-collins-fa8328a3c8aa5d5e0f34adb379e977b8","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-22","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00Z","title":"Digital Transformation in Education: Progress, Challenges, and the Future of Learning","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article discusses the ongoing digital transformation in education, highlighting the launch of Project Horizon, a nationwide initiative to integrate digital tools into classrooms.

The unfolding drama has so far included a sweep of old internet posts, a drunken video of Platner in his underwear, and now the urgently edited tattoo.  Amid the frenzy, another Democratic candidate released his own shirtless photo to show off his arm tattoo of former President Barack Obama’s presidential campaign logo.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n A Senate race intensifies quickly Platner launched his campaign in August, but the intensity of the race ratcheted up last Monday when Gov. Janet Mills announced her entry into a race Democrats feel they must have if they are going to reclaim a Senate majority. Her entry had the backing of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who has held the Senate seat for nearly 30 years. \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n     \n     \n \n     \n         \n                 \n             \n         \n                 \n             \n     \n     \n         \n         \n     \n     \n \n    \n    \n        \n             \n                 \n                    AP AUDIO: Maine Senate candidate Platner says tattoo recognized as Nazi symbol has been covered\n                 \n             \n        \n    \n    \n     In an AP interview, Graham Platner, a Maine Democrat running for U.S. Senate, says after the military, he had to get off the internet and rebuild his life. \n    \n Shortly after Mills jumped in, news began trickling out from Platner’s past. Platner, an oyster farmer who is running as a progressive, pushed back, saying the onslaught demonstrated that he wasn’t the preferred candidate of establishment Democrats.

A Celtic knot and a dog-like creature The new tattoo, completed late Tuesday, now is a Celtic knot with a dog-like creature splayed in the middle of it. The animal has four gangly legs and an elongated head with a curly tongue spiraling out.

More old Reddit posts surfaced Wednesday, with The Advocate reporting that Platner used homophobic slurs and made anti-LGBTQ+ jokes between 2018 and 2021. Platner has apologized for those comments, saying they were made after he left the Army in 2012, when he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.  He has resisted calls to  drop out of the race  and has the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills. Another primary rival, Jordan Wood, a onetime chief of staff to former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., said Wednesday that Platner should drop out because “Democrats need to be able to condemn Trump’s actions with moral clarity” and Platner “no longer can.” The National Republican Senate Committee, meanwhile, was fundraising off the controversy on Collins’ behalf. Platner said he was not ashamed to confront his past comments and actions because it reflects the lessons he needed to take to get where he is today. “I don’t look at this as a liability,” he told the AP, adding he sees it as “a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today. And I’m very proud of who I am.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Rally draws a raucous crowd During a rally in the southern Maine town of Ogunquit on Wednesday night, Platner again addressed his regret about the tattoo and the recent concerns about his history on social media. His mother, Leslie Harlow, who introduced him, also acknowledged it has been a rough week for her son, but that she has faith in his campaign to get through it. The event packed a 500 person-capacity theater and included frequent raucous applause. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A crowd watches as Democratic Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner speaks at a town hall in Ogunquit, Maine, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025.

I feel like I kind of understand where he was coming from,” Tufts said, adding that it “doesn’t increase my faith in him,” but he’s still on board with the campaign. ___ Kruesi reported from Providence, Rhode Island."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/naroditsky-death-chess-kramnik-cheating-allegations-396c3609a805ffb18da094aa65c9755b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"01:11:49+00:00","title":"American chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky dies at 29","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Chess Federation (FIDE) has initiated a formal review of Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik’s public accusations of cheating against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died at age 29.

international governing body said Wednesday it’s considering disciplinary action against a Russian former world champion who persistently leveled unproven cheating allegations at  Daniel Naroditsky  in the year leading up to the American grandmaster’s death. The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced  his death  Monday. He was 29. The cause of death has not been made public. Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online  chess  last October. He continued to share his suspicions on social media over the past year without providing substantial evidence.  Naroditsky, who at 18 became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from world chess champion, had denied the cheating allegations and accused Kramnik of trying to ruin his life. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, said Wednesday he has formally referred all relevant public statements made by Kramnik before and after Naroditsky’s death to the body’s Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for review.

Five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen called Kramnik’s relentless pursuit of Naroditsky “appalling.” During his last livestream Saturday, Naroditsky told his massive online following that Kramnik’s cheating claims had taken a toll on him.  “Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,” Naroditsky said, adding that Kramnik used to be one of his “heroes.” A history of cheating claims It’s not the first time Kramnik has been accused of harassment. The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik’s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless allegations about “many dozens of players.” The following year, Kramnik published a list of players on social media with the title “Cheating Tuesdays” that included Czech grandmaster David Navara. Navara later shared on his blog that Kramnik’s public accusations had pushed him to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In June, the federation responded to the players’ public spat, saying the way Kramnik presents his arguments “brings a lot of harm to the chess community,” and “could be ruinous for the careers and well-being of certain players.” The group invited Kramnik to present the details of his approach and statistical data for official evaluation. Kramnik’s anti-cheating crusade exploded with the game’s shift online during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many elite players traded the physical chess board for a keyboard to continue playing through lockdown, creating a surge in popularity for streaming content and fast-paced online games in which Naroditsky excelled.  Players of the cerebral sport are known to value respectful conduct over the board. But in the digital arena, a new level of toxicity has developed, with cheating allegations growing rampant and becoming much more difficult to prove. Players now have sophisticated computer schemes at their fingertips that could give them an unfair advantage, and new ways to profit off their success online. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Naroditsky’s impact on the speed game In blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches, experts say top talents often move with speed and precision on par with a computer. Naroditsky was among the world’s top 25 blitz players and won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich acknowledged Wednesday. “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Dvorkovich said the federation will establish a prize in Naroditsky’s memory.  Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause. Kramnik wrote on the social platform X that the death “should be investigated by police.” He wrote Wednesday that he received threats after revealing “public information about the ‘dark side’ of modern chess.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/east-wing-white-house-ballroom-demolition-b60fcfb6dae74bea1654ccd3baad188b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:05:56Z","title":"Trump Proposes Demolishing East Wing of White House to Build a 90,000-Square-Foot Ballroom, Sparking Bipartisan Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is pushing to demolish the East Wing of the White House to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom, citing the need for a larger entertaining space.

He has frowned on the past practice of presidents hosting state dinners and other large events in tents on the South Lawn.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The White House has said the ballroom will be ready for use well before Trump’s term ends in January 2029, an ambitious timeline. Trump said “me and some friends of mine” will pay for the ballroom, at no cost to taxpayers. The White House saw the addition of the East Wing in 1942 to house additional staff and offices. The  White House Historical Association  says the construction was controversial due to its timing during wartime. Congressional Republicans labeled the expenditure as wasteful, with some accusing Roosevelt of using the project to bolster his presidency’s image.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s opening remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday sought to tie the president’s work on the East Wing to the current government shutdown, saying that Trump was not focused on dealing with the issue of threatened health care coverage for millions of Americans but on “vanity projects like this one that don’t do anything to benefit the American people. They only benefit Trump and his ego.” Republican senators were dismissive at times of questions about the East Wing teardown. Asked whether he welcomed the renovations, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., replied: “I’m not much into architecture. I’m not a very good architect.” Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said the difference between Trump’s ballroom and a litany of prior construction projects that he recounted for reporters was that taxpayers wouldn’t be funding this one.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I mean, you’ve got a builder who has any eye for construction and for excellence. What better person would you want to renovate the White House?” Mullin said.  Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut took issue with Republicans comparing the ballroom to other renovation projects over the years. “They filled in the pool. They may have taken out a bowling alley. They haven’t destroyed an entire wing of the White House in a way that is irreversible,” Blumenthal said. “... I think it is just heartbreaking.” __ An earlier version of this story identified Chuck Schumer as Senate Majority Leader.

The Trump administration dismissed widespread criticism as \"manufactured outrage\" in  a fact sheet  released Tuesday, which outlines the various renovations that presidents have made to the property over the last century and suggests this one is no different. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House — a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence,\" the White House said. The White House has undergone renovations both large and small since its creation in 1792. But this would be the biggest addition — in scope and size — since the 1940s, Priya Jain, the chair of the Society of Architectural Historians' Heritage Conservation Committee,  told NPR . \"In the list that was issued yesterday, if you look at it closely, all the changes after 1942 have been limited to the interior,\" Jain said. \"And the ones on the exterior either involved simple restoration or minor site additions like the tennis court and the pavilion, which are limited by their scope, size and visibility to have any negative impact on the historic building.\" Here's a look at how presidents have changed the White House. 1700s and 1800s: The White House is built and rebuilt The cornerstone for the White House was laid in the newly designated nation's capital in  October 1792 , a year after President George Washington selected the site himself. The neoclassical building was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban and constructed by a team of  enslaved and freed Black Americans  and European immigrants over the course of eight years. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, were the first to inhabit the residence, which was  still unfinished  by the time they moved in toward the end of his term in November 1800. President Thomas Jefferson moved in the following year and went on to decorate the \"president's house\" with  furnishings he had inherited  from all of his presidential predecessors. But almost all of it was lost in 1814, when British troops  set fire to the building  during the War of 1812. President James Madison and first lady Dolley Madison both  fled Washington, D.C., to safety , the latter managing to  bring a full-size portrait of former President George Washington  with her. Both returned to a temporary residence to finish out his presidency. Hoban oversaw the rebuilding of the White House. Its second incarnation, which closely resembled the first, officially reopened with President James Monroe's arrival in 1817. Monroe later tasked Hoban with the building's first major addition,  the South Portico  — the iconic rounded entrance lined with Ionic columns — was completed in 1824. Construction of the  North Portico  was completed in 1830, under President Andrew Jackson. Early 20th century: The creation and expansion of the West Wing The next big changes happened under President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1901,  he renamed it  the \"White House\" in all formal communications, making its  longtime nickname  official. (It was originally called the \"president's house\" or \"executive mansion\", but most people started referring to it by its limestone white-wash coloring in the early 1800s.) In 1902, Roosevelt began a major renovation of the physical building that \"transformed it from a crazy quilt of alterations over time into a cohesive statement of modern times,\" the late author and historian  William Seale wrote . The biggest change was the relocation of his office from the second floor to the West Wing, originally called the Executive Office Building. The separate, one-story structure was accessible by walkway and housed the offices of presidential staff and secretaries as well as a Cabinet meeting room. The project expanded the first family's living quarters (necessary, since the Roosevelts had six young kids) and modernized the building's heating and plumbing systems. It also created the East Terrace — a new entryway for guests that would later become the East Wing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Subsequent presidents continued to build on Roosevelt's renovations. President William Taft remodeled and expanded the West Wing in 1909 to create the Oval Office. President Calvin Coolidge  had the roof rebuilt  and a third floor added in 1927, after an engineering report showed that the roof trusses were weakened and unsafe. The  West Wing was remodeled  after a 1929 fire and further  expanded in 1934 , when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt relocated the Oval Office to its current location for more privacy, built more offices underground and installed an  indoor swimming pool  for his polio therapy (financed by private donations). Mid-20th century: Controversial additions and a major renovation FDR also had the East Wing created in 1942, primarily to cover up  an underground bunker  and to house more staff and offices during the war. According to the  White House Historical Association , the wartime construction of the East Wing was highly controversial. Republicans criticized it as wasteful and accused Roosevelt of \"using the project to bolster his presidency's image.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The secretive nature of the construction, tied to military purposes, further fueled suspicions,\" wrote association president Stewart McLaurin. \"However, the East Wing's utility in supporting the modern presidency eventually quieted critics.\" The next major renovation, and perhaps the biggest one, happened under President Harry Truman in the late 1940s. In response to structural deficiencies, his architects decided to gut the entire interior, leaving only the exterior walls intact, between 1948 and 1952. The project cost the equivalent of $60 million —  funded and authorized  by Congress — and drew intense scrutiny from preservationists and the public. One of the most controversial changes was the addition of a balcony to the second floor of the South Portico. While opposed by some architectural purists and Truman's opponents in Congress for both aesthetic and financial reasons, the Truman Balcony has become a hallmark of both first family leisure and official White House events ( think: Easter Egg roll ). \"The Truman Balcony was something that was really controversial at the time, and now it's one of the most beloved parts of the White House for the president and their family to be sitting outside looking out on the South Lawn,\" Kate Andersen Brower, author of  The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House ,  told NPR 's  Here & Now. Truman  funded the balcony  himself, using money from his allocated household account. Brower said Trump's ballroom is the biggest renovation since then — but is different in key ways. \"[Truman] wasn't going to take no for an answer, but he did go through the channels to get approval for this renovation. And we're not seeing President Trump do the same thing,\" she added. Late 20th century onward: Presidents personalize the grounds  Recent decades have seen frequent but relatively minor changes to White House grounds. President John F. Kennedy created the  modern Rose Garden  in 1963 — and it remained relatively unchanged until this August, when  Trump had it paved over  and turned into a patio. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon  converted the indoor swimming pool  into the White House Press Room and installed a  one-lane bowling alley , while President Gerald Ford had a swimming pool (also privately funded)  built outdoors . In the early 2000s, President George W.  Bush modernized  the press briefing room and the Situation Room and installed the first-ever  solar electric system  on White House grounds (President  Jimmy Carter  first installed solar heating panels on the White House roof in 1979, but they were removed in the 1980s). President Barack Obama  adapted a tennis court  so it could also be used for basketball, and First Lady Michelle Obama planted the  White House Kitchen Garden  on the South Lawn. Trump has changed the grounds already Trump himself has made a slew of renovations since his second term began in January, and not just to the Rose Garden. He's also bedecked the  Oval Office with gilded frames  and golden details, and added a  Presidential Walk of Fame  to the walkway between the West Wing and executive residence. It features portraits of every previous president except for President Joe Biden. Instead of a headshot, Biden's frame features a picture  of an autopen , which Trump has repeatedly accused him of using (despite the fact that the practice is not prohibited). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The White House says Trump is carrying on a \"proud presidential legacy\" of making upgrades to the building, in this case increasing its capacity to host major functions. The East Room currently seats about 200 people for dinner, meaning many large White House events are hosted outside in fancy tents with floors and chandeliers. Brower, the author, says there is a case to be made for expanding the entertaining space at the White House, with caveats: \"I don't think that it has to be of this size and scope, two football fields big and larger than the White House itself.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-pardon-binance-changpeng-zhao-crypto-exchange-e1cb3fe516bc42b4c7ce5c107a280dc7","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:41:14+00:00","title":"Trump Pardons Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Amid Crypto Policy Shift","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, who served four months in prison for enabling money laundering tied to child sex abuse, drug trafficking, and terrorism under the Bank Security Act.

Donald Trump  has pardoned  Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , who created the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and served prison time for failing to stop criminals from using the platform to move money connected to child sex abuse, drug trafficking and terrorism. The pardon caps a monthslong effort by Zhao, a billionaire commonly known as CZ in the crypto world and one of the biggest names in the industry. He and Binance have been key supporters of some of the  Trump family’s crypto enterprises .  “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,” Zhao said on  social media  Thursday.  Zhao served four months in prison after reaching a deal with the Justice Department to plead guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at Binance. But, in explaining the pardon, Trump said of Zhao, “He was recommended by a lot of people.”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “A lot of people say that he wasn’t guilty of anything,” Trump said. “He served four months in jail and they say that he was not guilty of anything.” The president added that he didn’t believe he’d ever met Zhao personally, but had “been told” he “had a lot of support, and they said that what he did is not even a crime.” He said Zhao had been “persecuted by the Biden administration.”  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump’s favorability has fallen among Hispanics since January, a new AP-NORC poll finds \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 National Guard deployments in Washington, DC, and Portland, Oregon, are focus of court hearings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump administration finalizes plan to open pristine Alaska wildlife refuge to oil and gas drilling \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people,” Trump said.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n It’s the latest move by a president who has  flexed his executive power  to bestow clemency on political allies, prominent public figures and others convicted of crimes.  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the pardon in a statement and later told reporters in a briefing that the White House counsel’s office “thoroughly reviewed” the request. She said the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden pursued “an egregious oversentencing” in the case, was “very hostile to the cryptocurrency industry” and Trump “wants to correct this overreach.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The crypto industry has also long complained it was subject to a “regulation by enforcement” ethos under the Biden administration.  Trump’s pardon of Zhao fits into a broad pattern of his taking a hands-off approach to an industry that spent heavily to help him win the election in 2024. His administration has  dropped several  enforcement actions against crypto companies that began during Biden’s term and disbanded the crypto-related  enforcement team  at the Justice Department.  Former federal prosecutor Mark Bini said Zhao went to prison for what “sounds like a regulatory offense, or at worst its kissing cousin.”  “So this pardon, while it involves the biggest name in crypto, is not very surprising,” said Bini, a white collar defense lawyer who handles crypto issues at Reed Smith.  Zhao was released from prison last year after being  sentenced  for violating the  Bank Secrecy Act . He was the first person ever sentenced to prison time for such violations of that law, which requires U.S. financial institutions to know who their customers are, to monitor transactions and to file reports of suspicious activity. Prosecutors said no one had ever violated the regulations to the extent Zhao did. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The judge in the case said he was troubled by Zhao’s decision to ignore U.S. banking requirements that would have slowed the company’s explosive growth.  “Better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” was what Zhao told his employees about the company’s approach to U.S. law, prosecutors said. Binance allowed more than 1.5 million virtual currency trades, totaling nearly $900 million, that violated U.S. sanctions, including ones involving Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades, al-Qaida and Iran, prosecutors said. “I failed here,” Zhao told the court last year during sentencing. “I deeply regret my failure, and I am sorry.” Zhao had a remarkable path to becoming a crypto billionaire. He grew up in rural China and his family immigrated to Canada after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. As a teenager, he worked at a McDonald’s and became enamored with the tech industry in college. He founded Binance in 2017. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In addition to taking pro-crypto enforcement and regulatory positions, the president and his family have  plunged headfirst  into making money in crypto.  A stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial, a crypto project founded by Trump and sons Donald Jr. and Eric, received early support and credibility  thanks to an investment fund  in the United Arab Emirates using $2 billion worth of World Liberty’s stablecoin to purchase a stake in Binance. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are typically tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. A separate World Liberty Finance token saw a huge spike in price on Thursday shortly after news of the pardon was made public, with gains that far outpaced any other major cryptocurrency, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Zhao said earlier this year that his lawyers had requested a pardon.

Sunday  massacre in Northern Ireland that saw 13 people killed in a flurry of bullets. Judge Patrick Lynch ruled at Belfast Crown Court that prosecutors failed to prove that the veteran identified only as “Soldier F” had opened fire, with intent to kill, on unarmed civilians who were running to safety. Soldier F was the only soldier ever charged in connection with the events on Jan. 20, 1972 in Londonderry, also known as Derry. It was one of the deadliest incidents of the period known as “The Troubles,” the conflict between mainly Catholic supporters of a united Ireland and predominantly Protestant forces who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. In addition to the 13 killed, 15 others were wounded on Bloody Sunday. Survivors have spoken of the confusion, chaos and terror as soldiers opened fire and bodies began falling after a large civil rights march through the city.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The verdict was a blow to families of victims who have spent more than a half-century seeking justice. While the sectarian violence largely ended with the  1998 Good Friday peace accord  and Northern Ireland has become a beacon of hope for other conflicts around the world, tensions remain. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The verdict in detail Soldier F was shrouded from view in court by a curtain throughout the five-week trial, and did not testify in his defense. It was a nonjury trial, as has been the standard in cases related to the decades-long period of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.  He had pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder for the deaths of James Wray, 22, and William McKinney, 27, and five counts of attempted murder for the shootings of Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon, Patrick O’Donnell, and for opening fire at fleeing demonstrators. The judge said the evidence presented against the veteran fell well short of what was required for conviction. But he berated the soldiers from the Parachute Regiment on duty that day for the way they responded, and how their actions sullied the memory of a unit that had a proud record in World War II. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “They had totally lost all sense of military discipline,” he said. “Shooting in the back unarmed civilians fleeing from them on the streets of a British city. Those responsible should hang their heads in shame.” However, the judge said that because there was no concept of “collective guilt” in the courts, he wasn’t able to issue a guilty ruling against Soldier F.  The sole evidence against Soldier F was from two other veterans, Soldiers G and H, one of whom is deceased while the other refused to take to the dock for fear of incriminating himself. “Their statements, the sole and decisive evidence, cannot be tested in a way that witnesses giving evidence from the witness box would be,” the judge said. “Delay has, in my view, seriously hampered the capacity of the defense to test the veracity and accuracy of the hearsay statements.” A blow to families of victims Mickey McKinney, brother of William McKinney who was shot dead on Bloody Sunday, said the failure to bring anyone to justice “lies with the British state” for failing to investigate the murders “properly, or indeed at all; and with the British Army who shielded and enabled its soldiers to continue to murder with impunity.” Over the decades since, Bloody Sunday has become a source of shame for a British government that had initially claimed that members of a parachute regiment fired in self-defense after being attacked by gunmen and others hurling firebombs.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Relief for veterans and their campaigners Supporters of army veterans complain that their losses have been downplayed and that they have been unfairly targeted in investigations. Defense lawyer Mark Mulholland attacked the prosecution’s case as “fundamentally flawed and weak” for relying on soldiers he dubbed “fabricators and liars,” and the fading memories of survivors who scrambled to avoid live gunfire that some mistakenly thought were rounds of rubber bullets. Veterans and their campaigners welcomed Thursday’s verdict.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It has become increasingly clear that the admissibility of certain types of evidence, particularly those based on decades-old recollections, remains deeply problematic,” said Northern Ireland veterans commissioner David Johnstone.  “Soldier F has faced legal scrutiny in various forms for more than a quarter of a century, and it is my hope that today’s ruling by Judge Lynch brings that long and arduous process to a close,” he added. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The long road to the case  Following the peace process that was initiated by the Good Friday Agreement, steps were taken to foster trust between Catholics and Protestants as well as between the people of Northern Ireland and the British government. An inquiry in 2010 found that the soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday had shot unarmed civilians fleeing and then lied in a cover-up that lasted for decades. Then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron apologized and said the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable.” The findings cleared the way for the eventual  prosecution of Soldier F , though delays and  setbacks kept it from coming to trial  until last month. On Thursday, a spokesman for current Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the not-guilty verdict was “an example of the complex legacy of the Troubles.” He said the government is “focused on setting out a way forward to deal with this difficult period in a fair and balanced way that allows victims to seek answers and get closure, including bereaved forces’ families.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/alaska-arctic-drilling-oil-gas-trump-burgum-b3f2e701d5bdee6f840ea1849ae6716b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"21:14:33Z","title":"Trump Administration Finalizes Plan to Open Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to Oil Drilling","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, under U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, fulfilling prior political commitments.

Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to potential oil and gas drilling, renewing a long-simmering debate over whether to drill in one of the nation’s environmental jewels. U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the decision Thursday that paves the way for  future lease sales  within the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre ( 631,309 hectare) coastal plain, an area that’s considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich’in. The plan fulfills pledges made by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to reopen this portion of the refuge to possible development. Trump’s bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, passed during the summer, called for at least four lease sales within the refuge over a 10-year period.  Burgum was joined in Washington, D.C., by Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s congressional delegation for this and other lands-related announcements, including the department’s decision to restore oil and gas leases in the refuge that had been canceled by the prior administration.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A federal judge  in March said the Biden administration lacked authority to cancel the leases, which were held by a state corporation that was the major bidder in the first-ever lease sale for the refuge held at the end of Trump’s first term. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump’s favorability has fallen among Hispanics since January, a new AP-NORC poll finds \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 National Guard deployments in Washington, DC, and Portland, Oregon, are focus of court hearings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Michigan terminates controversial EV battery plant and seeks to claw back millions in incentives \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Leaders in Indigenous Gwich’in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and they oppose drilling there.

Burgum on Thursday announced completion of a  land exchange deal  aimed at building the road that would run through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

The refuge, near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. Past land exchange proposals have been met with controversy and litigation. The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said the latest land agreement would exchange about 500 acres (202 hectares) of “ecologically irreplaceable wilderness lands” within the refuge for up to 1,739 acres (703.7 hectares) of King Cove Corp. lands outside the refuge. Tribal leaders in some communities further north, in Yup’ik communities in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, have expressed concerns that development of a road would harm the migratory birds important to their subsistence ways of life. “Along with the Native villages of Hooper Bay and Paimiut, we absolutely plan to challenge this decision in court,” said Cooper Freeman, the center’s Alaska director. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, told reporters she has been fighting for the land access for King Cove throughout her tenure and has been to both the community and the refuge.

— President  Donald Trump  announced he’s ending “all trade negotiations” with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs that he said misstated the facts and called “egregious behavior” aimed at influencing U.S. court decisions. The post on Trump’s social media site came Thursday night after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he aims to double his country’s  exports to countries outside the U.S.  because of the threat posed by Trump’s tariffs. Trump’s call for an abrupt end to negotiations could further inflame trade tensions that already have been building between the two neighboring countries for months.  Trump posted, “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.” “The ad was for $75,000.

As for the Supreme Court, Trump is referring to a case scheduled for early November in which the justices will consider the legality of his sweeping tariffs. Two lower courts have determined that Trump cannot unilaterally impose  wide-ranging tariffs  under  an emergency powers law . His administration argues otherwise, saying he can regulate importation and that includes tariff policy.  Carney  met with Trump earlier this month  to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump said earlier this week that he had seen the ad on television and said that it showed that his tariffs were having an impact. “I saw an ad last night from Canada. If I was Canada, I’d take that same ad also,” he said then. In his own post on X last week,  Doug Ford , the premier of Ontario, posted a link to the ad and the message: “It’s official: Ontario’s new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched.” He continued, “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.” A spokesperson for Ford didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. But Ford previously got Trump’s attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs. The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada’s government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas. Trump’s tariffs have especially hurt Canada’s auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would  move a production line  from Ontario to Illinois ___ Associated Press writers Seung Min Kim in Washington and Rob Gillies in Toronto, Ontario, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-white-house-ballroom-57512e0d91432f75529946fddfbfe2c5","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:55:47+00:00","title":"White House East Wing Demolished for New $300 Million Ballroom Project","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House East Wing has been completely demolished to make way for a new, expansive ballroom that would be nearly twice the size of the White House itself.

The East Wing, where first ladies created history, planned state dinners and promoted causes, is now history itself. The two-story structure of drawing rooms and offices, including workspace for first ladies and their staffs, has been  turned into rubble , demolished as part of the Republican president’s plan to build a ballroom nearly twice the size of the White House at an updated cost of $300 million. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Trump said Wednesday that keeping the East Wing as is would have “hurt a very, very expensive, beautiful building,” referring to the ballroom that he said presidents have wanted for years. He said he “and some friends of mine” will pay for the ballroom at no cost to taxpayers. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump pardons Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, high-profile cryptocurrency figure \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the $250 million ballroom Trump is adding to the White House \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 How the shutdown is affecting workers, federal programs and the economy \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Higher tab for the new ballroom The proposed ballroom was announced as a $200 million project in July, a cost Trump publicly updated to $250 million last week. On Thursday, he put the price tag “in the neighborhood” of $300 million.  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attributed the demolition and higher building cost to changes that happen with any construction.  “The plans changed when the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this phase one that we’re now in was necessary and the president wants to do right by the ‘People’s House,’” Leavitt said at her press briefing Thursday. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Trump said later Thursday that some $350 million had been raised for the project, but he remained vague about his personal contribution.  “I won’t be able to tell you until I finish,” he told reporters, “but I’ll donate whatever is needed.” White House chafes at criticism of Trump’s plan \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A worker walks through debris at a largely demolished part of the East Wing of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington, before construction of a new ballroom.

Leavitt said the public would continue to be apprised of changes but encouraged everyone to “just trust the process.” She said a more modern East Wing would be built along with the ballroom. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Demolition of the East Wing came as a surprise Trump allowed the East Wing demolition to begin without advance warning Monday and despite not having approval from the relevant government agencies with jurisdiction over construction on federal buildings. Preservationists had urged the Trump administration to halt the demolition, for which approval was not required, Leavitt said Thursday, until plans for the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) ballroom could go through the required public review process. The National Trust for Historic Preservation said the review process, which includes public comment, would “provide a crucial opportunity for transparency and broad engagement — values that have guided preservation of the White House under every administration going back to the public competition in 1792 that produced the building’s original design.” \n         \n            \n                 \n    \n\n\n     Before and after satellite images of demolition of East Wing \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n        \n            \n                 \n                     \n     \n        \n        \n            \n                \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n     \n     \n \n\n\n            \n        \n        \n         \n             \n                 \n             \n         \n     \n     \n         \n             1 of 2  |  \n             This satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows the White House in Washington, Sept. 26, 2025, with the East Wing intact before demolition began.

The Park Service manages the White House grounds and has a role in the process as several trees on the South Lawn have been cut down as part of the construction. Both agencies currently are closed because of  the government shutdown . Trump installed  top aide Will Scharf  as chairman of the planning commission.  The National Park Service said in August, after the White House announced the ballroom project, that it had provided historic preservation guidance and support as part of a broader consultation process. It said final decisions are made by the Executive Office of the President. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n East Wing history The East Wing, which is across East Executive Avenue from the Treasury Department, has been the traditional base of operations for the first lady and her staff, along with the social office, military office and the visitors office, among others. Those operations have been temporarily relocated to workspace elsewhere on the White House campus.  The East Wing is where visitors entered for public tours and to attend events, such as White House state dinners, holiday and other receptions, and events featuring the president. Tours were halted in late summer in preparation for the ballroom construction.  The wing also sat atop an emergency bunker and wrapped around the first lady’s garden, which is named after Jacqueline Kennedy.  Some tourists reacted positively to the project. “It’s his house. He can do with it, you know, he’s spending his money and not my taxpayer money. It’s OK with me,” Erich Habelt, of California, said. “And as with any old house, things need to be renovated.” The White House actually is government property, not Trump’s house.  Herb Hutchison, of Alabama, pointed out that past presidents had added to the White House. Hutchison said friends who visit Washington talk often “about the need for a bigger meeting space or a hall close to the White House, and it sounds like this is going to do it. So, I don’t see it as any more than making something better than it was before.” ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim and video journalist River Zhang contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hasina-son-wazed-joy-interview-fc2480f5583210bf293c0f40f5f0bdbd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:34:41+00:00","title":"Bangladesh Son of Ousted PM Calls for End to Party Ban Ahead of 2026 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the 2024 student-led uprising that ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, her son Sajeeb Wazed has called on Bangladesh's interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to lift the ban on the Awami League party, warning that an exclusionary election would be a sham. The ban, implemented in May 2024, has led to widespread arrests of party leaders and supporters, with Wazed accusing the Yunus-led government of political manipulation, human rights violations, and targeting religious minorities. Human rights groups including Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists have criticized the ban as a violation of democratic freedoms.

In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Sajeeb Wazed said Bangladesh would remain politically unstable if the current interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate  Muhammad Yunus , fails to hold an inclusive election. “This ban has to be lifted, the elections have to be inclusive and free and fair,” Wazed, who was a former adviser to the government headed by her mother, told the AP from Washington D.C. “What is happening now really is an attempt to keep my mother and our political leaders from running in elections. This is political manipulation disguised as justice,” he added. Bangladesh is expected to hold an election in February 2026. It will be the first polls in the South Asian nation since a student-led uprising ousted Hasina last year,  ending her 15-year rule  and forcing her to flee to India, where she has been in exile since.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Three days after her ouster, Yunus took the helm and promised to restore order and introduce  reforms. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Clashes break out near Bangladesh parliament as major parties sign a roadmap for change \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Bangladesh prosecution seeks death penalty for ex-PM Sheikh Hasina over protest killings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A look at some world leaders who have fled uprisings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n In May his government banned the activities of Hasina’s Awami League party and arrested many of its senior leaders.

So even if the ban is lifted at the last minute, the elections will be a sham,” he said. Bangladesh, a parliamentary democracy of 170 million people, has 52 registered political parties. The fall of Hasina’s government last year has hindered the democratic transition of power, and its politics  remained at a crossroads .  Islamist party returns The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, headed by Hasina’s main political rival and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is the main contender in the next election. Another major party,  Jatiya Party  is not allowed to operate openly, with its party headquarters attacked and burned down and its rallies routinely thwarted. Bangladesh’s political landscape is also more fragmented than before after the country’s largest Islamist party, the  Jamaat-e-Islami , returned to politics more than a decade after it was suppressed by Hasina’s government. Over the last year, it has significantly expanded its presence and is attempting to build an alliance with other hard-line Islamist groups and parties.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Wazed said Islamists would gain if Bangladesh remains unstable. He blamed Yunus for backing them and planning a “rigged election” to bring them to power. The interim government did not immediately comment. Wazed acknowledged some initial “mistakes” from the Hasina government, which has been accused of brutally cracking down on the protesters, but disputed a United Nations report saying up to  1,400 people  may have been killed during the uprising. He cited a statement from a health adviser under Yunus, saying that about 800 people were killed. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Human rights accusations Wazed said all the deaths were “regrettable” and needed thorough investigation, but questioned the Yunus-led government’s decision to grant immunity to the protesters involved in last year’s violence. He also accused Yunus’ government of initiating a witch-hunt against Hasina, who has been  charged of crimes against humanity .  Last week, a prosecutor in a special domestic tribunal in Bangladesh sought the death penalty for  Hasina . She did not appoint any lawyers to represent her, and she had earlier rejected the trial process as a “kangaroo court.” Wazed also accused the Yunus government of violating human and political rights, saying tens of thousands of Awami League party supporters have been jailed for over a year and denied bail, with many of them charged with murder. He claimed some 500 Awami League activists have been murdered since the uprising, mostly by mobs, and 31 party activists have died in custody. “The human rights record of this regime is brutal,” Wazed said, adding that the country’s religious minorities, especially Hindus, are  a prime target .  The interim government had earlier denied such allegations of harassing minorities."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-oil-trump-china-a3ff10477f2693b81d8e5a0050c0c4f3","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:47:44+00:00","title":"Wall Street Climbs to the Cusp of Records as Oil Prices Jump","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. stock markets rose to the cusp of record highs on October 23, 2025, driven by a sharp surge in oil prices following President Donald Trump’s announcement of massive sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil.

2025-10-23T05:47:44+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose to the cusp of their records on Thursday, as  oil prices jumped   after President Donald Trump announced “massive” new  sanctions on Russia’s crude industry. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and crept back within 0.2% of  its all-time high   set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 144 points, or 0.3%, and finished just below  its own record   set earlier this week, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%.  Companies in the oil and gas business led the way, including gains of 1.1% for Exxon Mobil, 3.1% for ConocoPhillips and 3.4% for Diamondback Energy. They rose with prices for crude, which leaped roughly 5.5% after Trump announced  sanctions against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil .  The hope is to convince Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to end the brutal war with Ukraine, and sanctions could constrict the global flow of oil. The jumps helped oil prices recover some of their sharp recent losses, taken because of expectations for supplies of crude in inventories to remain plentiful. Oil prices are still down more than 10% for the year so far. \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n     \n     \n \n     \n         \n                 \n             \n         \n                 \n             \n     \n     \n         \n         \n     \n     \n \n    \n    \n        \n             \n                 \n                    AP AUDIO: Wall Street climbs to the cusp of records as oil prices jump\n                 \n             \n        \n    \n    \n     Wall Street keeps moving higher. \n    \n \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Also helping to drive the stock market higher were strong profit reports from several big U.S. companies, as the reporting season ramps up for their profits during the summer.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 144.20 to 46,734.61, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 201.40 to 22,941.80. In the gold market, prices strengthened to halt a sharp recent slide. The price for an ounce climbed 2% to $4,145.60 per ounce.  It had  dropped sharply the last two days  after setting its latest all-time high, as momentum suddenly gave out following what’s been a stunning year. The price of gold has jumped about 57% so far in 2025. Many of the factors that have sent gold on its monumental rise are still around, including concerns about the mountains of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are amassing. The U.S. government’s gross national debt  topped $38 trillion   on Wednesday, and the worry is that a continued acceleration will only worsen inflation.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.00% from 3.97% late Wednesday. That was ahead of a report coming on Friday that will show how much inflation U.S. consumers felt during September. The report was initially due earlier this month but was delayed because of the U.S. government’s shutdown.  If the reading ends up benign, it could encourage the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates in hopes of giving the slowing job market a boost. It delivered its first cut of the year last month, but it’s been wary of promising many more because lower rates can make inflation worse.  In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across Europe following a more mixed finish in Asia.  Stocks rose 0.7% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai as leaders in Beijing wrapped up an important  Communist Party  meeting to  set the agenda  for the coming five years. The party said afterward that it will  focus on speeding up self-reliance   in science and technology. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.4%, and South Korea’s Kospi sank 1% for two of the world’s larger losses. ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-boko-haram-drones-attack-53cecf196c896a0f579052aa30654da8","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:56:34+00:00","title":"Nigeria Military Kills Over 50 Boko Haram Militants After Drone Attacks","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigeria's military has killed over 50 Boko Haram militants in response to drone attacks on military bases in Borno and Yobe states, with attacks originating from northern Cameroon and the village of Katarko.

Boko Haram, Nigeria’s homegrown jihadis, took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law or Sharia. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The decade-long conflict has spilled into Nigeria’s northern neighbors, including  Niger , and resulted in the death of around 35,000 civilians and the displacement of more than 2 million others, according to the United Nations. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Ghana police rescue 57 Nigerians in crackdown on human trafficking and cybercrime \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Judge orders former South African President Zuma to repay $1.6 million in legal fees \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Youth anger in Ivory Coast as the 83-year-old president seeks a fourth term \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The insurgent group split into two factions after the death of the group’s longtime leader,  Abubakar Shekau , in 2021.

It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/miami-heat-kevin-rozier-gambling-probe-de98ecb76bb8f13b85f4c5ac62f66221","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:31:26+00:00","title":"Trail Blazers Coach Chauncey Billups and Heat Guard Terry Rozier Arrested in Sports Betting Probe Linked to Mafia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major federal investigation, Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier were arrested and charged with participating in a widespread sports betting conspiracy involving organized crime.

Follow the latest updates on  the arrests of Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and the Miami Heat’s Terry Rozier in a sports betting case \n    \n \n NEW YORK (AP) — The head coach of the  Portland Trail Blazers  and a player for the  Miami Heat  were arrested Thursday along with more than 30 other people in a takedown of two sprawling gambling operations that authorities said leaked inside information about NBA athletes and rigged poker games backed by Mafia families. Portland coach  Chauncey Billups  was charged with participating in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games tied to La Cosa Nostra organized crime families that cheated unsuspecting gamblers out of at least $7 million. Heat guard  Terry Rozier  was accused in a separate scheme of  exploiting private information  about players to win bets on NBA games. The two indictments unsealed in New York create a massive cloud for the NBA — which opened its season this week — and show how certain types of wagers are  vulnerable to massive fraud  in the growing, multibillion-dollar  legal sports-betting industry . Joseph Nocella, the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of New York, called it “one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalized in the United States.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “My message to the defendants who’ve been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,” Nocella said. “Your luck has run out.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Stephen Curry’s heroics overshadow Aaron Gordon’s 50-point night in Warriors’ OT win \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Stephen Curry’s 42 points lift Warriors over Nuggets in thrilling 137-131 OT win \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Sports betting is a booming business.

Billups, who was inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame  last year, had about $106 million in earnings over his 17-year career. Rozier made about $160 million in his stops in Boston, Miami and Charlotte. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Billups and Rozier have been placed on leave from their teams, according to the NBA, which said it is cooperating with authorities. “We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,” the NBA said in a statement. Hours after his arrest, Rozier appeared in a federal court in Orlando, Florida, wearing a Charlotte Hornets sweatshirt, handcuffs and shackles. Billups appeared before a judge in Portland, Oregon. Both men were ordered released from custody on certain conditions.  Billups’ attorney, Chris Heywood, issued a statement Thursday evening denying the allegations, calling his client a “man of integrity.” “To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his Hall-of-Fame legacy, his reputation and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game,” Heywood said. Rozier’s lawyer, Jim Trusty, said in a statement that his client is “not a gambler” and “looks forward to winning this fight.” Trusty criticized authorities for not allowing his client to surrender on his own and accused officials of wanting “the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Messages were left Thursday at a phone number and email address listed in public records for Jones. Roughly 20 other defendants appeared in federal court in Brooklyn, where most of them pleaded not guilty. Many of those charged with violent crimes or with lengthy criminal records and ties to organized crime were detained. Mafia families profited off gambling scheme, officials say The poker scheme lured unwitting players into rigged games with the chance to compete against former professional basketball players like Billups and Jones. The games were fixed using sophisticated cheating technology, such as altered card-shuffling machines, hidden cameras in poker chip trays, special sunglasses and even X-ray equipment built into the table to read cards, authorities allege. The scheme often made use of illegal poker games run by New York crime families that required them to share a portion of their proceeds with the Gambino, Genovese and Bonnano crime families, according to court papers. Members of those families, in turn, also helped commit violent acts, including assault, extortion and robbery, to ensure repayment of debts and the continued success of the operation, officials said in court documents. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Athletes accused of leaving games early In the sports betting scheme, Rozier and other defendants are accused of accessing private information from NBA players or coaches that could affect a player’s performance and giving that information to others so they could place wagers. Players sometimes altered their performance or took themselves out of games early to rig prop bets — a type of wager that allows gamblers to bet on whether a player will exceed a certain statistic, such as a total number of points, rebounds or assists, according to the indictment. In one instance, Rozier, while playing for the  Charlotte Hornets  in 2023, told people he was planning to leave the game early with a supposed injury, allowing gamblers to place wagers earning them tens of thousands of dollars, authorities said. That game against the  New Orleans Pelicans  raised eyebrows at the time. Rozier played the first 9 minutes and 36 seconds of the game before leaving, citing a foot issue. He did not play again that season. Posts still online from March 23, 2023, show that some bettors were furious with sportsbooks that evening when it became evident that Rozier was not going to return to the game after the first quarter, with many turning to social media to say that something “shady” had happened regarding the prop bets involving his stats for that night. The indictments contain the descriptions of several unnamed NBA players whose injury status and availability for certain games were the source of betting activity. Those players are not accused of any wrongdoing, and there is no indication that they would have even known what was being said about their status for those games. Those players include  LeBron James ,  Anthony Davis  and  Damian Lillard . Their identities are clear based on a review of corresponding injury reports surrounding games mentioned in the indictment. The indictments show that certain defendants shared information about the availability of those players in a game on March 24, 2023, involving the Portland Trail Blazers, and two games in 2023 and 2024 involving the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA had investigated Rozier previously. He was in uniform as  the Heat played the Magic  on Wednesday in Orlando, Florida, in the season opener for both teams, though he did not play in the game. ___ Durkin Richer reported from Washington, and Reynolds reported from Miami.

2025-10-18T07:32:37+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump torpedoes international deal to reduce shipping emissions\n\nMembers of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.\n\n“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.\n\nDisappointed, but still very much Committed!  https://t.co/7P192kAvCx\n\n— Thomas A. Kazakos (@ThomasKazakos)  October 17, 2025\n\nRalph Regenvanu, the minister for climate change for Vanuatu, said the decision to delay the vote by 12 months was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.\n\n“But we know that we have  international law  on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” Regenvanu added.\n\nLeading up to Friday’s decision, China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO had reaffirmed their support.\n\nCountries that opposed the measures included  Russia  and Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Russian delegate described the proceedings as “chaos” as he addressed the plenary on Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.\n\nArgentina and Singapore, two countries that had previously voted in support of the framework in April, were among those that voted to postpone introducing it this week.\n\nIf it had been formally adopted this week, the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would have been the first global carbon-pricing system, charging ships a penalty of $380 per metric tonne on every extra tonne of CO2-equivalent they emit while rewarding vessels that reduce their emissions by using alternatives.\n\nThe framework plan is intended to help the IMO reach its target of cutting net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050.\n\nClimate change is already beginning to affect shipping and the safety of seafarers, including by changing  ocean currents  and causing more frequent and  severe storms .\n\nProposals to reduce reliance on dirtier bunker fuel in the shipping industry include using ammonia and methanol, as well as fitting cargo ships with special sails."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm in the Caribbean this year, is threatening the Caribbean Sea islands with dangerous landslides and life-threatening flooding due to heavy rains.

of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—by the Ministry of Commerce, effective from December 1, 2025.

The US, which imports 70% of its rare-earth materials from China and relies on these metals for defence systems like F-35 jets, submarines, and missiles, faces significant technological and industrial vulnerabilities. Analysts from CSIS and the University of Montana interpret the action as a form of pre-meeting diplomacy to pressure the US, highlighting the deep interdependence of the two economies despite their trade tensions.","keyTakeAways":["China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, now restricting 12 out of the 17 known rare-earth elements, including five new additions: holmium,

critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a significant advancement in its space program.

many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/five-dead-two-missing-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-soaks-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:40:23+00:00","title":"Five dead, two missing as Tropical Storm Fengshen soaks Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Fengshen caused significant damage in the Philippines in October 2025, resulting in at least five deaths and two people missing.

Khartoum in fourth day of sustained attacks\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have targeted Sudan’s capital Khartoum and its main airport with drones for a  fourth consecutive day , as the government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) attempts to resume air traffic after regaining control of the city several months ago.\n\nDrones and surface-to-air missiles were heard above the capital in the early hours of Friday morning, residents living close to the Khartoum International Airport told Al Jazeera, before loud explosions went off.\n\nIt is unclear whether the capital’s main airport was successfully hit and the extent of the damage.\n\nThe attack marks the fourth consecutive day of attacks that began on Tuesday, a day before the  airport was scheduled to become operational  after at least two years of war.\n\nA single plane operated by the local Badr Airlines landed on Wednesday, before an airport official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the airport’s reopening has been postponed “under further notice” because of incoming attacks.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from Khartoum, said that “despite authorities saying that operations are scheduled to start on October 26, there are concerns that this will not happen”.\n\nThe war, which started in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced about 12 million more and left 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, making it the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe Sudanese military retook the capital from the paramilitary force in March. Since then, residents have been tentatively returning to their homes, often to find them destroyed.\n\nAlfatih Bashir’s house in Omdurman, which he built using all his savings, has collapsed ceilings and damaged walls. “I built it when I was working abroad,” Bashir told Al Jazeera, adding that now he did not posses the necessary funds to repair the damage.\n\n“I’m not working, I’m just sitting idly with my wife and two children. We sometimes barely have enough to eat. How can I even start to rebuild?” he said.\n\nAuthorities are still assessing how many houses have been damaged in the conflict, but the scars of the battle between the military and the RSF are visible across the capital.\n\nAnother resident, Afaf Khamed, said she fainted when she saw the extent of the damage.\n\n“This house is where we were born, where all our family members got married. I now live here with my sister, and we can’t rebuild because we don’t have anyone to help us,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe collapse of the local currency makes reconstruction an impossible feat even for those who have retained a job during the war. While salaries have remained stable, the Sudanese pound spiked from 600 pounds to the US dollar in April 2023, when the conflict started, to 3,500 pounds.\n\nGoods are also hard to come by in the war-torn country, hampering reconstruction. Shop owner Mohammed Ali said materials take too long to arrive because of security checks, and that makes them more expensive. As a consequence, “fewer and fewer people are coming to buy building materials”, he said.\n\nSudan’s government has pledged to rebuild the capital, but its focus as so far has been on state institutions, while residents are left to figure out how to rebuild on their own."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/court-throws-out-corruption-case-seeking-to-oust-turkish-opposition-leader","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:07:44+00:00","title":"Court throws out corruption case seeking to oust Turkish opposition leader","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish court has dismissed a corruption case targeting the leadership of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), specifically aiming to invalidate the election of Ozgur Ozel as chairman at a 2023 congress.

a case against the country’s main opposition party that would have unseated its leader,  Ozgur Ozel , on grounds that the charges had no substance.\n\nThe case, which centred on allegations of vote buying and procedural irregularities at a 2023 congress held by the Republican People’s Party (CHP), was dismissed by the Ankara court on Friday, after the judge found it had “no basis”, according to news agency AFP.\n\nThe  case , brought by a former party member in February, had sought to invalidate the results of the congress, which had seen 51-year-old Ozel elected chairman, at a time when hundreds of party members had been jailed this year for alleged corruption.\n\nTurkiye’s law enforcement agencies have detained more than 500 people, including 16 mayors over the last year in Istanbul and other CHP-run municipalities, according to a review by the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe crackdown saw Istanbul Mayor  Ekrem Imamoglu , the CHP’s presidential candidate for the 2028 election, arrested last March for corruption – an allegation he denies. That arrest triggered Turkiye’s biggest protests in more than a decade and a sharp sell-off of the lira, the national currency.\n\nEarlier this month, the party’s Istanbul head was removed from office after a court said delegates’ votes in a CHP provincial congress were influenced by cash payments. The party went on to expel the court-named successor from the party.\n\nAnd recently it emerged that prosecutors were seeking a total of 415 years in prison for Riza Akpolat, mayor of the Istanbul district of Besiktas, who was accused of bid rigging.\n\nThe CHP claims that all charges are politically motivated, with Ozel having publicly accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of mounting a “coup against the future ruling party” in a bid to institute one-party rule in the country.\n\nThe Turkish government maintains that the judiciary is independent and denies political motives for the investigations into what Erdogan has described as a corrupt network resembling “an octopus whose arms stretch to other parts of Turkiye and abroad”.\n\nAhead of the 2028 presidential election, most polls show the CHP neck and neck with Erdogan’s AK Party.\n\nReporting from Ankara, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said the case was “critical” and that the ruling would “boost his [Ozel’s] legitimacy” and allow him to “strengthen his base” ahead of the 2028 election.\n\nShe said the court had “probably hesitated to give such an annulment decision”.\n\n“When you ask constitutional experts, they have always said that any allegation within a political party must be dealt [with] by the higher election board because the political parties are private entities. A local court may not interfere,” she said.\n\nPosting on X days before Friday’s verdict, Ozel said the party’s supporters would “march forward without fear, without division, growing hope”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"14:52:29Z","title":"Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the escalating US-China trade conflict, centered on President Donald Trump’s threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth metals.

threat: History of US trade measures against China\n\nChina has accused the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes, specifically the cold-resistant Culiseta annulata species, have been detected in Iceland for the first time, marking a significant ecological shift.

2025-10-23T15:45:13+00:00\n\nTitle: Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up the glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kidafell, Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley around 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Cuilseta annulata are not known to carry disease, but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well-adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“However, their development is slower, their active season shorter, and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley, from the Royal Entomological  Society, told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes, but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Iceland and Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland is, in fact, abundant with. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction, and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from -1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11 degrees Celsius (52 degrees Fahrenheit) in the warmer months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year – making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s, when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how these particular mosquitoes came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May this year, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were some 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting, and are projected to lose about half of their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website states.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens [diseases] they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then, in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September this year, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae from areas in which they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, which serve as ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\nTilley added that these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study patterns in climate change, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

2025-10-15T13:18:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/at-least-25-killed-in-india-after-bus-catches-fire-in-crash-with-motorcycle","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:54:36+00:00","title":"At least 25 killed in India after bus catches fire in crash with motorcycle","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A passenger bus traveling between Hyderabad and Bengaluru in southern India caught fire after colliding with a motorcycle in Chinnatekuru village, near Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh.

Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/dutch-voters-hit-polls-as-immigration-fears-propel-far-right-towards-power","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:37:58+00:00","title":"Dutch voters hit polls as immigration fears propel far right towards power","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Netherlands is facing a snap parliamentary election on October 29, 2025, following political instability triggered by the departure of the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) from a coalition government over immigration policy disagreements.

up for a snap parliamentary election on October 29, less than halfway through parliament’s usual four-year term following the collapse of the ruling coalition, the likelihood of another win for the country’s far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) is mounting.\n\nAn outright win is next to impossible. The Netherlands has always had a coalition government formed by a minimum of two parties due to its proportional representation electoral system, under which seats in parliament are awarded to parties in proportion to the number of votes they win.\n\nThe PVV, headed by Geert Wilders, also won the most votes in the last election in November 2023. It then partnered with three other far-right parties – the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), New Social Contract (NSC), and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) – to form a coalition government.\n\nBut in June, PVV made a dramatic exit from the  coalition government  over a disagreement on immigration policy. PVV had wanted to introduce a stricter asylum policy that included closing borders to new asylum seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of crimes, but the other parties demanded further discussions.\n\nIn a dramatic move, Wilders took to X to announce that the failure by other parties to agree to PVV’s plans meant it would leave the coalition.\n\nCoalition partners slammed this decision and accused Wilders of being driven by self-interest. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said at the time that Wilders “chooses his own ego and his own interests. I am astonished. He throws away the chance for a right-wing policy”.\n\nFollowing the pull-out, Prime Minister Dick Schoof – an independent – announced that he would resign and a snap election would be held this month.\n\nThen, in August, the NSC’s Foreign Minister  Caspar Veldkamp  also resigned after he failed to secure support for new sanctions against Israel over its war in Gaza and the humanitarian situation in Gaza City. In solidarity with Veldkamp, other NSC party members left the coalition, leaving only two parties remaining.\n\nNow, with an election imminent, opinion polls suggest the PVV will secure the most seats in the 150-seat parliament. While a winner needs 76 seats to form a government, no single party ever makes it to that figure, which has led to a history of coalitions.\n\nAccording to a poll by the Dutch news outlet, EenVandaag, on October 14, the PVV is projected to secure 31 seats. The centre-left Green-Labour alliance (GroenLinks-PvdA) is polling at 25 seats, and the centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) is polling at 23.\n\nPVV’s former coalition partner, the centre-right VVD, could take 14 seats and the BBB, four. So far, the NSC is not projected to secure any seats at all.\n\nAt the end of September, EenVandaag polled 27,191 people and found that the main sticking point between voters – and, hence, between the leaders, PVV and GroenLinks-PvdA – is immigration. Half of all voters said it was the key issue on which they would be voting this year. Housing was the second-most important issue at 46 percent, and “Dutch identity” came third at 37 percent.\n\nWhile the PVV is firmly anti-immigration and wants to impose a much stricter border policy and asylum laws, GroenLinks-PvdA would prefer to allow a net migration figure of 40,000 and 60,000 migrants per year.\n\nTempers are running high over this issue. Last month at The Hague, a right-wing activist known as “Els Rechts” organised an  anti-migration protest  that attracted 1,500 attendees. According to reports, protesters threw stones and bottles at the police, set a police car alight and smashed windows of the left-wing Democrats 66 (D66) party offices.\n\nWhile left-wingers argue that the immigration issue has been wildly hyped up by the far right, they are losing control of the narrative.\n\nEsme Smithson Swain, a member of MiGreat, a Dutch non-governmental campaign group that calls for freedom of movement and equal treatment for migrants in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera that the far right in the Netherlands and in the  United Kingdom , more widely, had “constructed a narrative that there is a migration crisis”.\n\n“They’ve managed to construct this idea of a crisis, and that distracts our attention away from populism, away from arms trades, away from social services and the welfare state being sold off.”\n\nWhatever its merits, the right-wing message that immigration is at the root of many social ills seems to be taking hold. The far-left, pro-immigration BIJ1 party, which rejects this message, is not projected to win any seats at all in this election.\n\nImmigration “is a key term especially for right-wing political parties to win the election”, Noura Oul Fakir, a candidate for the BIJ1 party, told Al Jazeera. “We don’t focus on it because we look at everything that’s been going on from a systemic point of view, that every form of oppression is interlinked … This fight for equality and justice, it’s about more than just immigration, but it’s also interlinked with other issues that we see nowadays.”\n\nBy January 1, 2024, the Netherlands was hosting 2.9 million migrants (16.2 percent of the population), compared to the average across European Union member states of 9.9 percent (44.7 million people in total).\n\nSimilarly, Germany hosts 16.9 million migrants (20.2 percent of the population); France, 9.3 million (13.6 percent of the population); Spain, 8.8 million (18.2 percent of the population); and Italy, 6.7 million (11.3 percent of the population), according to figures from the EU.\n\nMark van Ostaijen, an associate professor in public administration and sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, explained that immigration has become a mainstream talking point in “housing, care, educational and cultural policy domains”.\n\nFor instance, the Netherlands is currently short of 434,000 homes, including for 353,000 asylum seekers and 81,000 Dutch first-time buyers, according to figures commissioned by the Ministry of Housing and Spatial Planning (VRO).\n\nImmigration has, therefore, been blamed for what is seen as a housing crisis.\n\nAccording to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), 316,000 migrants arrived in the country in 2024, 19,000 fewer than in 2023. But CBS also found that population growth is still mainly down to net migration, with the largest number of migrants coming from Ukraine and Syria.\n\n“I think this is indeed something that will continue the electoral legitimacy of far-right parties, or right-wing parties, even more, given the fact that the Netherlands was already quite leaning towards the conservative angle,” van Ostaijen told Al Jazeera.\n\n“This will be a topic that will haunt our politics and our democratic decision-making and discourse for quite a while,” he said.\n\nAnecdotal evidence bears this out. Fakir has noticed a change in the experiences of immigrant residents she and her colleagues have spoken to in the country following the growth of the PVV.\n\n“In their personal life [they have seen] a noticeable shift where people feel more free or emboldened to express racist views, both online and in real life. Others are telling them those classic things of ‘go back to your own country, or you’re not Dutch’,” she said.\n\nFor Nassreddin Taibi, a recent graduate who works as a political analyst and plans to vote for GroenLinks-PvdA, the anti-immigration protests at the Hague “further cemented polarisation among Dutch voters” and have caused centrist parties to fall into line with the right-wing narrative.\n\n“These protests have influenced the discourse in the sense that centrist parties now say that cutting immigration is necessary to win back trust of voters in politics,” he said.\n\nWhile the far-right PVV is projected to win the most seats in this election, it will still face an uphill journey to form a government, as other parties such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) have ruled out joining a coalition government.\n\nFurthermore, the PVV’s leader, Wilders, has not escaped controversy with his Islamophobic comments and anti-migration stance despite the rise in anti-immigration sentiment across the country as a whole.\n\nNotable incidents over the years include Wilders’ likening of Islam to Nazism in 2007 and his reference to the Muslim holy book, the Quran, as “fascist” in a letter to a Dutch news outlet. His letter and comments led to Wilders being prosecuted for inciting hatred and discrimination, which he denied. In 2011, he was acquitted by a judge who ruled that his comments had fallen within the scope of free speech.\n\nMore recently, in August this year, Wilders posted an image on X that depicted a smiling, blonde and blue-eyed woman, representing the PVV; and a wrinkled, angry-looking elderly woman wearing a headscarf, representing the PvdA. It was accompanied by the words: “The choice is yours on 29/10.”\n\nAan U de keuze op 29/10  pic.twitter.com/royhcInDlm\n\n— Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv)  August 4, 2025\n\nFake news and misinformation have also driven the rise in far-right narratives, analysts say.\n\nThe Facebook page ‘Wij doen GEEN aangifte tegen Geert Wilders’ (We are NOT filing charges against Geert Wilders), which claims to be a PVV supporters’ page boasting 129,000 followers, said it does not intend to be “discriminatory, hateful, or incite violence”, but has nevertheless posted AI-generated images of this nature.\n\nIn one such image, which received 1,700 likes, a white family is seemingly being harassed by men of colour.\n\nIn another, a white woman is seen in a supermarket paying for groceries while surrounded by Muslim women wearing hijabs and niqabs, with the caption: “No mass immigration, no Islamisation, no backwardness of the Dutch.” The post received 885 likes.\n\nWhile the outgoing home affairs minister, Judith Uitermark, has said the government is examining new ways to combat fake news, she added that the Netherlands is somewhat protected from the rise of extremism by its proportional representation system, under which no one party ever wins a majority.\n\nStill, the Dutch Data Protection Authority has  warned voters  not to use AI chatbots to help them decide who to vote for.\n\nAnd a large number are still deciding. EenVandaag found that some 48 percent of voters are still undecided about which candidate they will choose. If the GroenLinks-PvdA can disengage from right-wing talking points and, instead, focus on its own policies more, it may perform better than expected, analysts say.\n\nThis will be no easy task, however.\n\n“We find ourselves doing this also as a civil society organisation, as campaigners, trying to fight off the narrative and fight off the kind of populist ideals of the far right faster than we can push for our own agenda as well. And I think a lot of the time that leaves left-wing parties in the Netherlands seeming a bit hollow,” Swain said.\n\nStill, she says that she is holding out hope for this election, despite what feels like a “vast and growing far-right bulk of the population”.\n\n“I think it’s very easy to kind of feel that division between ‘us and them’. Us campaigning on the left and this growing mass of the far right,” Swain said.\n\n“We need to tackle fighting the influence of lobbying and of fake news in our political structures. And I think that becoming more united as a population would naturally fall from that.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/trump-administration-to-open-up-alaska-wildlife-refuge-to-drilling","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:20:04+00:00","title":"Trump administration to open up Alaska wildlife refuge to drilling","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has finalized plans to open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling, a move that reignites tensions between environmental protection and energy development.

wildlife refuge to drilling\n\nThe Trump administration has finalised plans to allow oil and gas drilling in a national wildlife refuge spanning pristine Indigenous land in Alaska, reigniting long-simmering tensions about conserving one of the United States’s environmental jewels.\n\nThe US Department of the Interior announced at an event on Thursday that it plans to open up the coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which sits on traditional Inupiaq and Gwich’in Indigenous land, to resource exploration.\n\nIn a news release, it said the move, which paves the way for lease sales within the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre (631,309-hectare) coastal plain, was part of a “sweeping package of actions to boost energy development, modernise land and resource management across Alaska”.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and congressional Republicans previously pledged to reopen this portion of the refuge to possible development.\n\nAnnouncing the move, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said, “from day one, President Trump directed us to unlock Alaska’s energy and resource potential while honouring commitments to the state and local communities”.\n\nA Republican bill featuring major tax breaks and spending cuts, passed during the summer, called for at least four lease sales within the Alaska refuge over a 10-year period.\n\n“By reopening the Coastal Plain and advancing key infrastructure, we are strengthening energy independence, creating jobs and supporting Alaska’s communities while driving economic growth across the state,” Burgum said.\n\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain – which sits near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, and contains internationally recognised habitat for migrating waterfowl – is considered sacred land to Indigenous Gwich’in communities, who oppose the drilling.\n\nConservationists have also condemned the move. Meda DeWitt, Alaska senior manager with The Wilderness Society, said it places “corporate interests above the lives, cultures and spiritual responsibilities of the people whose survival depends on … the health of the Arctic Refuge”.\n\nSupportive of the drilling, however, are the Inupiaq Indigenous community in the town of Kaktovik, which sits within the refuge. They consider responsible oil development to be key to their region’s economic wellbeing and development.\n\nThe Kaktovik Inupiat Corp, the native village corporation founded in 1973 that owns the land in and around Kaktovik, praised this week’s announcement from the Trump administration.\n\n“It is encouraging to see decision makers in Washington advancing policies that respect our voice and support Kaktovik’s long term success,” its president, Charles “CC” Lampe, said in a statement.\n\nIn Thursday’s announcement, Burgum also said a land exchange deal had been completed aimed at building a road connecting the communities of King Cove and Cold Bay that would run through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nWhile King Cove residents have long called for a road to be opened, conservationists and tribal leaders have promised to launch a legal challenge.\n\nRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters she had been fighting for land access for King Cove throughout her tenure, but said it was in everyone’s interest to ensure the road is built with minimal disturbance to local wildlife.\n\n“I think it’s important to remember that nobody’s talking about a multi-lane paved road moving lots of big trucks back and forth,” she said. “It is still an 11-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/lithuanian-president-says-russian-jets-violated-the-countrys-airspace","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:21:07+00:00","title":"Lithuanian president says Russian jets violated the country’s airspace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two Russian military aircraft — a Su-30 fighter and an Il-78 refuelling tanker — briefly entered Lithuanian airspace, breaching international law and triggering a diplomatic and military response.

Lithuania’s airspace in what appeared to be a new provocation from Moscow as European Union leaders discussed how to strengthen their defences amid deepening concerns the  war in Ukraine  could spill over into their nations.\n\nLithuania’s armed forces said in a statement that the two aircraft – an Su-30 fighter and an Il-78 refuelling tanker – may have been conducting refuelling exercises in the neighbouring Russian exclave of Kaliningrad when they flew 700 metres (0.43 miles) into the country at 6pm local time (15:00 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n“This is a blatant breach of international law and territorial integrity of  Lithuania ,” said President Gitanas Nauseda on X, adding that his country would summon Russian embassy representatives to protest against reckless and dangerous behaviour.\n\nTwo Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon jets from the NATO Baltic Air Police were scrambled in response and were patrolling the area, the Lithuanian military said.\n\nRussia’s Defence Ministry denied the incursion had taken place, saying the flights were conducted “in strict compliance” with rules and “did not deviate from their route and did not violate the borders of other states”.\n\nThe incident occurred after Nauseda and his fellow EU leaders attended a  Brussels summit  on Thursday, endorsing a plan dubbed Readiness 2030 to ensure that Europe can defend itself against an outside attack by the end of the decade.\n\nIt follows a series of mysterious drone incidents and airspace violations by Russian warplanes in recent weeks that have heightened anxiety that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be testing NATO’s defensive reflexes.\n\nThree Russian military jets violated  Estonia’s airspace  for 12 minutes on September 19 in what was described by Tallinn as an “unprecedented and brazen intrusion”.\n\nNine days before, NATO jets had shot down 20 Russian drones that entered  Polish airspace , marking the first time an alliance member had engaged directly with Russia since the start of the Ukraine war.\n\nFellow Baltic state leaders Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal and Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze both expressed full solidarity with Lithuania.\n\nPolish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said the incident showed that “Russia is in no way calming down or retreating” and that continued vigilance is required.\n\nThursday’s EU summit also saw the bloc greenlight a major package of sanctions against Russia for its war on Ukraine.\n\nIt stopped short of endorsing the use of Russian  frozen assets  to give Kyiv a large loan. Russia had threatened a “painful response” if its assets were seized."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/nba-gambling-arrests-stun-league-expose-mafia-links-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"09:25:25+00:00","title":"NBA gambling arrests stun league, expose mafia links: What to know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sweeping federal investigation has uncovered a massive illegal sports betting and poker cheating conspiracy involving NBA players, coaches, and members of New York’s organized crime families.

to know\n\nA massive betting scandal  has hit  American basketball, with players and a coach now facing charges.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States attorney for Brooklyn announced two indictments in what they say is a massive cheating conspiracy involving current and former basketball players, coaches and members of New York’s organised crime families. On Thursday, the FBI also carried out  arrests,  including of NBA players allegedly involved in the scam.\n\nThe news came during the NBA season’s opening week, just as the league launched new broadcast deals worth $76bn over 11 years. It’s the latest in a series of scandals to hit US sport since sports betting took off in 2018.\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nA sweeping federal investigation has shaken the world of professional basketball, uncovering ties between NBA figures and organised crime in an illegal betting network worth millions of dollars.\n\n“The investigative work that culminated with this morning’s operation are reminiscent of a Hollywood movie. But this was not luck, and it was not theatrics,” said Ricky Patel, the special agent in charge of homeland security investigations, who has led the ongoing probe.\n\nIn total, 34 individuals were arrested across 11 states. Among those arrested were Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, and former Cleveland Cavaliers player Damon Jones.\n\nAuthorities said they unsealed the indictments and  carried out  coordinated arrests nationwide on Thursday.\n\npic.twitter.com/UcOBnWxe00\n\n— FBI (@FBI)  October 23, 2025\n\nFirst indictment: Sports betting scheme ( US v Eric Earnest Indictment )\n\nIn the first case, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and several others are accused of using insider information, knowing when players would sit out or leave early with “injuries”, to place targeted bets on those athletes underperforming in points, assists or rebounds.\n\n“They also misused information obtained through longstanding friendships that they had with NBA players and coaches,” Joseph Nocella, the interim US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said.\n\nThe indictment highlights seven games in 2023 and 2024 on which hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of illegal bets were allegedly placed.\n\nRozier’s lawyer denies all charges and said that his client will fight the legal accusations.\n\nSecond indictment: Poker cheating operation ( United States v Aiello )\n\nThe second case centres on a sophisticated poker-cheating ring allegedly orchestrated by organised crime groups in New York.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, victims were drawn into high-stakes poker games after being told they would compete against well-known former athletes, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups.\n\nBut the games were rigged. Crime groups allegedly used fake shuffling machines and an X-ray poker table that showed players’ hidden cards, letting them cheat victims out of huge sums.\n\nOfficials say victims lost at least $7m overall. Those charged include game organisers, suppliers of the cheating equipment, and participants, among them Billups, who allegedly took part in several such games in 2019.\n\nProsecutors say the scheme was backed by members of the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese, and Genovese crime families, which controlled portions of New York’s underground poker circuit. These groups allegedly collected a share of the profits, enforced payments through extortion and robbery, and laundered proceeds via cryptocurrency and other channels.\n\nAlong with the Colombo family, the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese groups represent the “Five Families”, which have dominated New York’s Italian-American mafia since 1931. They form part of a broader American-Sicilian network known as La Cosa Nostra (Our Thing), whose members maintain ties to their counterparts in Sicily.\n\nThirteen members and associates of the crime families were also indicted.\n\nThese are the defendants named in the indictments that include former and current NBA players:\n\nChauncey Billups:  Portland Trail Blazers head coach. Billups is alleged to have functioned as a “face card” (a celebrity figure used to attract players) for poker games that were rigged. Billups was also a star player in his time, a part of the NBA for 17 years, most of those years with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nDamon Jones:  Former NBA player and assistant coach for Los Angeles in 2022-23. Jones is accused of supplying inside information to allow a network of conspirators to place winning bets on games. And like Billups, he is also accused of helping to lure wealthy people to participate in poker games.\n\nTerry Rozier:  An NBA player who, as a member of the Charlotte Hornets, is accused of providing insider information about his playing status to people involved in illegal sports betting. Federal investigators allege that before a 2023 Charlotte Hornets game, Rozier told associates he’d leave early due to an injury, leading to heavy bets on his “unders”.\n\nBetween December 2022 and March 2024, the defendants allegedly ran a plan to profit from insider NBA information by placing bets that were almost guaranteed to win, then hiding the money trail afterwards.\n\nSome of the methodologies include:\n\nAccording to the indictment, the defendants and their partners used high-tech cheating devices and secret communication systems to control the outcome of underground poker games.\n\nSome of the methods include:\n\nThe hidden reader\n\nOther tools used:\n\nThe defendants also occasionally used other technologies, including:\n\nAccording to experts, this is unexpected.\n\n“The idea that poker would be at least part of today’s news was unexpected,” Mike McCann, professor of law at Harvard University, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“And also the alleged role of the mafia, that there are mafia ties to this, that kind of came out of nowhere,” he added.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, the NBA said it is currently reviewing the newly announced federal indictments and is cooperating fully with authorities.\n\nThe league also confirmed that Rozier and Billups have been placed on immediate leave from their respective teams."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/palestinian-child-killed-in-israeli-raid-on-west-bank-as-settlers-rampage","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"08:23:07+00:00","title":"Palestinian teen killed in Israeli raid on West Bank as settlers rampage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 18-year-old Palestinian teen, Mohammed Ahmed Abu Haneen, died during an Israeli military raid in the Askar camp in Nablus, amid a broader wave of violence in the occupied West Bank.

an Israeli military raid in the Askar camp in Nablus, in the latest violence against civilians in the occupied West Bank, as a fragile  ceasefire in Gaza  brings little respite to Palestinians in the destroyed enclave.\n\nEighteen-year-old Mohammed Ahmed Abu Haneen died on Friday from wounds sustained during the Israeli raid, the Wafa news agency reported.\n\nIsraeli forces also stormed the town of Aqaba, north of Tubas in the West Bank, and made a number of arrests earlier today in Hebron and Tal.\n\nThe Israeli army said they arrested 44 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank over the past week. A military statement says operations were carried out in various parts of the territory and all people detained were wanted by Israel. It added that troops also confiscated weapons and conducted interrogations during the operations.\n\nLast week, 10-year-old Mohammad al-Hallaq was shot dead by Israeli forces while playing football in ar-Rihiya, Hebron.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army and settlers since October 7, 2023, in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nA fifth of the victims are children, including 206 boys and seven girls, the UN said. The number also includes 20 women and at least seven people with disabilities.

wants to ‘freeze’ Russia-Ukraine war: Who gets what if that happens?\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has suggested  freezing the war  in Ukraine at its current front lines and using these lines as a starting point for future negotiations over territory.\n\nPeace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine have so far stalled despite Trump boasting during his presidential campaign last year that he could end the war in “24 hours” after his inauguration.\n\nRussia insists that it must be allowed to keep all the land it has seized from Ukraine and be granted more if it is to consider a ceasefire. Ukraine has balked at this, and Trump has  failed to move either side .\n\nHere is what the current front lines look like and how Russia and Ukraine have reacted to this latest proposal:\n\nTrump has proposed halting the war where the fighting is now occurring.\n\n“They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.\n\n“The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this. We take that.'”\n\nWhen Trump was asked if he had advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to cede the whole of the eastern region of Donbas, which borders Russia and which it has laid claim to, he said no.\n\n“Let it be cut the way it is. It’s cut up right now. I think 78 percent of the land is already taken by Russia,” Trump told a reporter from the Reuters news agency.\n\n“You leave it the way it is right now. They can … negotiate something later on down the line.”\n\nOver the course of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine, Russia has  seized  territory primarily in four eastern and southern Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. It also controls a small pocket of Kharkiv province.\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas, which has seen the most fighting.\n\nRussia controls all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk, including the areas around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nRussia also controls about 75 percent of Kherson and Zaporizhia.\n\nZaporizhia is a significant industrial region known for its steel, aluminium and aircraft manufacturing and is also home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.\n\nUkraine and Europe have backed Trump’s plan to freeze the battle lines.\n\nOn Tuesday, European leaders and Zelenskyy signed a statement saying they “strongly” support Trump’s proposal.\n\n“The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” the statement said.\n\nPreviously, Ukraine has insisted on reclaiming all of its land. But Trump has flip-flopped over whether Ukraine should or should not be required to cede land to Russia in any peace deal.\n\nIn August before a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war, Trump stated that both Russia and Ukraine would have to cede territory to end the war.\n\n“There’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump told reporters at the time.\n\nThen in September, Trump appeared to make a U-turn, saying Ukraine  could win the war militarily  and recapture the territories occupied by Russia, including the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014, and other areas in eastern Ukraine. “Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!” Trump wrote in a social media post.\n\nRussia has rejected the plan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is committed to “a long-term, sustainable peace – not an immediate ceasefire that would lead nowhere”.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added that “the consistency of Russia’s position doesn’t change,” referring to its hardline demands to end its war, including a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions that Moscow has laid claim to.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported that Russia had sent a private communique to the US over the weekend, demanding control of all of the Donbas – not just the parts it has already seized.\n\nA planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary, in the next two weeks was shelved this week as Trump said he did not want a “wasted meeting” with Putin.\n\n“It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get, so I cancelled it.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to meet European leaders in the United Kingdom for talks on military aid to stave off future Russian aggression if a ceasefire stops the war now in its fourth year.\n\nZelenskyy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to be joined at the Foreign Office in London on Friday by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof.\n\nAbout 20 other leaders are to join via videolink at the meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing”, a group of countries that have pledged strengthened support for Ukraine.\n\nThe meeting also intends to work out ways of helping protect Ukraine’s power grid from Russia’s almost daily  drone and missile attacks  as another punishing winter approaches, enhancing Ukrainian air defences and supplying Kyiv with longer-range missiles that can strike deep inside Russia.\n\nRussia has intensified its heavy bombardments of Ukraine, targeting civilian areas as well as energy infrastructure before winter. Rolling power cuts have been introduced across the country in recent days, including in Kyiv, as the country rations electricity.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has so far resisted efforts to negotiate a peace settlement with Zelenskyy and has argued that Russia’s all-out invasion of its smaller neighbour is legitimate.\n\nFriday’s talks aim to step up pressure on Putin, adding momentum to measures in recent days that include a  new round of sanctions  from an increasingly frustrated United States and Europe that take aim at Russia’s vital oil and gas export earnings.\n\nStarmer criticised Putin’s unbudging stance before Friday’s meeting. “Time and again we offer Putin the chance to end his needless invasion, to stop the killing and recall his troops, but he repeatedly rejects those proposals and any chance of peace,” the UK prime minister said.\n\nAny peace agreement appears at the moment to be a distant possibility.\n\nA Ukrainian drone crashed into an apartment block in a Moscow suburb on Friday, wounding a boy and four other people, officials said.\n\nWhile such attacks are common inside major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, this was a rare strike close to the Russian capital.

man executed with nitrogen gas for 1993 murder\n\nThe US state of Alabama has executed a man convicted in a 1993 killing, using nitrogen gas, a controversial method of execution that has been described by critics as a “cruel and unusual form of punishment.”\n\nAnthony Boyd, 54, was executed on Thursday evening in the United States for killing a man by setting him on fire over a $200 drug debt.\n\nBoyd has maintained his innocence in the case and repeated his position in his last words.”I didn’t kill anybody. I didn’t participate in killing anybody,” he said on Thursday, according to CBS News. “There can be no justice until we change this system.”\n\nBoyd’s death marks the seventh time that Alabama has used nitrogen gas on death row inmates since January 2024.\n\nThe method has been used instead of the intravenous lethal injection due to complications administering it and, more recently, in obtaining the cocktail of toxic drugs, according to the US-based Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nThe use of nitrogen gas is particularly controversial because it can draw out the length of an execution. Prior to his execution, Boyd appealed to several courts to be killed by firing squad instead, but his request was turned down.\n\nThe US Supreme Court also rejected his plea that nitrogen gas violates the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution that prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments”.\n\nThe court’s majority decision was opposed by the Supreme Court’s three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. In her dissent, Sotomayor described nitrogen gas as a “torturous suffocation” compared with other methods.\n\n“Boyd asks for the barest form of mercy: to die by firing squad, which would kill him in seconds,” she wrote. “The Constitution would grant him that grace. My colleagues do not. This Court thus turns its back on Boyd and on the Eighth Amendment’s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.”\n\nSarah Clifton, a local reporter who observed Boyd’s execution for the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper on Thursday, said the entire procedure took nearly 40 minutes from the time Boyd was strapped down to when he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe state turned on nitrogen gas at 5:57pm local time, but Boyd kept breathing and spasmed for more than 20 minutes until he lay still at 6:18pm, Clifton said. The gas was turned off by the state at 6:27pm, and Boyd was pronounced dead at 6:33pm.\n\nPrior to his death, Boyd had spent 30 years in prison. He was sentenced to death in 1995 by a jury vote of 10-2 for the murder of Gregory “New York” Huguley, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nThe prosecution’s case was based solely on witness testimony with no physical evidence, the centre said. The legal case was also heard in an Alabama county that at the time had the “highest per capita rate of death sentences in the nation”, it said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/white-house-confirms-trump-to-meet-xi-in-south-korea-as-part-of-asia-tour","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:47:53+00:00","title":"White House confirms Trump to meet Xi in South Korea as part of Asia tour","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on October 30, ahead of the APEC summit in Gyeongju, as part of a broader diplomatic tour across Asia.

of a major regional economic summit being held in South Korea next week, the White House has confirmed.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a press briefing on Thursday that Trump is scheduled to participate in a “bilateral meeting” with Xi in South Korea on the morning of October 30, before returning to Washington.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit – an inter-governmental forum promoting free trade among 21 economies located around the Pacific Rim – will be held in the city of Gyeongju on October 31 and November 1.\n\nLeavitt did not make clear whether Trump would be attending the APEC summit itself.\n\nTrump earlier confirmed his meeting with Xi, saying on Wednesday that the leaders “have a pretty long meeting scheduled”, before adding that he hoped the superpowers could “work out a lot of our doubts and questions”.\n\n“I think something will work out. We have a very good relationship, but that will be a big one,” Trump said as he answered questions alongside NATO chief Mark Rutte at the White House.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Xi will take place amid escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The US leader has imposed a 30 percent tariff on Chinese imports into the US and threatened  higher levies  in the near future should a deal not be struck.\n\nTrump also said he will push Xi to stop Chinese companies from purchasing Russian oil, after he imposed his first sanctions on Moscow on Wednesday since returning to the White House.\n\nThe sanctions package – which targeted  Russia’s two largest oil firms , Rosneft and Lukoil – was the result of Russian President Vladimir Putin refusing “to end this senseless war” in Ukraine, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.\n\nOutlining the US leader’s full itinerary, Leavitt said Trump will depart the White House on Friday night before landing in Malaysia, where the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit is taking place next week, on Sunday morning local time.\n\n“President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of Malaysia in the afternoon [on Sunday], and then he will attend the ASEAN leaders’ working dinner that evening,” she said.\n\nThe US leader will then travel to Tokyo on Monday morning, where he will attend a bilateral meeting with Japan’s new Prime Minister  Sanae Takaichi  on Tuesday.\n\nLeavitt said Trump will then “travel to Busan on Wednesday [October 29] morning for a bilateral meeting with the president of the Republic of Korea, deliver a keynote address at the APEC CEO luncheon and attend the leaders’ working dinner that evening”.\n\nKorean government officials later said the meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung would actually take place in the city of Gyeongju, where this year’s APEC summit is being hosted, according to The Korea Economic Daily newspaper.\n\nThe mix-up, according to the officials, likely stems from Busan reportedly being the venue for the US-China summit. Leavitt did not confirm where Trump would meet Xi in her comments to reporters on Thursday.\n\nPresident Lee plans to hold meetings with Trump and Xi separately, according to South Korean presidential security adviser Wi Sung-lac.\n\n“Through a series of summits between the leaders of South Korea and the United States, the United States and China, and South Korea and China, we will not only highlight South Korea’s role as a platform but also build consensus for peace, prosperity, and stability in the region,” Wi told reporters.\n\nHe continued that South Korea was hoping to move forward with Washington on issues surrounding security and tariffs, but he was uncertain whether any agreement would be reached.\n\nIndustry Minister Kim Jung-kwan said on Friday that Seoul and Washington remain “at odds” on how to implement a $350bn investment pledge by South Korea as part of a deal to lower tariffs on its exports to the US."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/24/live-un-calls-on-israel-to-open-gazas-rafah-increase-aid-amid-ceasefire?update=4056864","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:00:11Z","title":"‘Daily struggle to survive’ in north Gaza amid Israeli aid block","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In north Gaza, Palestinians returning to their homes after displacement are finding them empty and are facing a daily struggle to survive due to an Israeli aid blockade.

And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time.\"\n\nThis is the opening line of the minute-long advert. The words have not been altered.\n\nBut it is not until about halfway through his original address that Reagan speaks these lines.\n\nThe 1987 radio speech - Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - begins with Reagan saying Japan's prime minister will visit the White House and \"recent disagreements\" on trade will be discussed. Reagan had recently placed tariffs on some Japanese goods over a trade agreement dispute.\n\nBy the time he reaches the advert's opening line, he has set out his aversion to tariffs, described the \"prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\", and said high tariff legislation made the Great Depression even worse.\n\n\"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"\n\nIn the advert, these words immediately follow the first line. Again, Reagan did speak these words.\n\nHowever, in the original address the two sentences are not connected. In fact they are separated by more than a minute of speech, and the \"Over the long run..\" line actually comes first.\n\nAfter introducing the Japanese state visit, Reagan starts to explain why he recently introduced the tariffs.\n\nHe says in the original speech: \"Imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take. And in a moment I'll mention the sound economic reasons for this:  that over the long run such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer. \"\n\nReagan says some companies had been \"engaging in unfair trade practices\" and going against an agreement with the US - and that this was therefore a \"special case\".\n\nThis sets the tone for the rest of the address, which he dedicates to making clear his commitment to free trade and the dangers of high tariffs.\n\n\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.\"\n\nThis is the advert's third line, and again these are Reagan's words. But again, in the original speech they do not follow straight on from the previous line in the advert. There is about one minute separating them in the address.\n\nIn the 1987 speech he says this line in the middle of his address while describing what he sees as the consequences of tariffs. He says:\n\n\"What eventually occurs is: First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs.  High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.\"\n\n\"Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"\n\nReagan does say this line after the previous one - but the advert cuts out a few sentences separating them.\n\nHere is the full run from one to the next in the original:\n\n\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.  The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\n\n\"So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying.  Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.\"\n\n\"Throughout the world, there's a growing realisation that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition.\"\n\nHere, the advert jumps back about a minute - but the words are the same.\n\nIn the original, Reagan praises the economic benefits of free trade and continues: \"Now, that message of free trade is one I conveyed to Canada's leaders a few weeks ago, and it was warmly received there. Indeed,  throughout the world there's a growing realisation that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition.\"\n\nHe then talks about the \"sound historical reasons\" for this realisation: \"For those of us who lived through the Great Depression, the memory of the suffering it caused is deep and searing.\"\n\nHe says experts believe high tariff legislation passed at that time \"greatly deepened the depression and prevented economic recovery\".\n\n\"America's jobs and growth are at stake.\"\n\nThis is how Reagan ends his speech both in the address and the advert, in relation to tariffs.\n\nThe final chunk of his speech is omitted from the ad - in which he says he is determined \"to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity\" and criticises opponents in Congress who \"want to go for the quick political advantage\" and \"forget\" the millions of jobs involved in trade."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv8q5evvqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:22:43.507+00:00","title":"Purges to self sufficiency: Three things we learned from China's big political meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent four-day plenum of the Chinese Communist Party, chaired by General Secretary Xi Jinping, concluded with a communique emphasizing technological self-reliance and domestic market development.

For example, very serious illness.\n\nAnd yet, of the 205 members of the Central Committee, only 168 were there.\n\nWe know that one has died and 10 have already been purged.\n\nThat leaves 26 missing cadres.\n\nDo these missing members mean that more senior Party officials have been taken down in the latest \"anti-corruption\" drive than have been reported?\n\nOn top of this there are also dozens of missing \"alternate\" delegates. These are non-voting positions for people who can fill missing slots as required.\n\nNames of those not in attendance have not been provided, but it is not a small number of missing delegates. This has led to wide speculation that they too have been purged in the latest sweeps from the Party's feared internal discipline inspection teams.\n\nIn the military alone the numbers are stark.\n\nIt seems that of the 33 generals who are members of the Central Committee, 22 did not attend the plenum. This might include the eight who have been removed officially but where are the other 14? Who are they and what happened to them?\n\nWith China's opaque system of governance, sometimes questions like these are never answered.\n\nWhat is clear though is that the Party was clearing the decks in the days leading up to this gathering so such dismissals could be made official, including the expulsion of He Weidong who was number three in the PLA.\n\nPolitical analysts will argue though as to whether this represents strength or weakness on General Secretary Xi's part. Are these the acts of a paranoid leader concerned that power blocks might be forming beyond his control, or the firm hand of a figure prepared to take down those who act improperly irrespective of their rank?\n\nEither way, it seems there will be no letting up.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, the Director of the Central Policy Research Office, Jiang Jinquan, said the Party would \"maintain an unwavering tenacity with no finish line in the fight against corruption\".\n\nWhen Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet in South Korea next week, they will be discussing the considerable trade frictions between the two superpowers.\n\nAt the pointy end of this, China wants better access to US computer chips and advanced software and the US wants better access to China's rare earths and magnets. The problem is that both sides are reluctant to provide them because they will assist in boosting the other's economic and political strength.\n\nSo, Beijing needs other sources for its high-tech requirements, leading naturally to the conclusion: when in doubt develop it yourself.\n\nA key objective listed in the communique was the achievement of  \"substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance\".\n\nThen – just to make it really clear – the read out from the Communist Party's trusted Xinhua wire service again referred to \"self-reliance\", stating: \"The country should achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology and steer the development of new quality productive forces\".\n\nXi Jinping's catchphrase of \"new quality productive forces\" gets used a lot in Chinese government documents. It encapsulates the drive for homegrown, high-level, technological advances – often with military applications – which are to emerge in partnerships between the private sector, state-owned enterprises and the People's Liberation Army.\n\nIt is all about more tech, better tech, hopefully without any reliance on the Americans.\n\nAnother impact of the trade war with the US has been the loss of export markets. This has been a heavy blow to an economy which has been, and remains, heavily reliant on selling goods overseas.\n\nWell before the tariff conflict with the Trump administration, academics had been warning China that it needed to rebalance its economy, placing a much greater emphasis on domestic consumption as opposed to exports.\n\nThe thinking was that it was not sustainable, in the long run, to have such a low proportion of GDP made up by the Chinese people's consumption rates as they stood.\n\nTrump's tariff assault on the world has brought this into sharper focus. New charges on the import of Chinese made goods have slowed some of them being sold in the US.\n\nWhile China's exporters have proven to be more resilient than Trump predicted – finding new global buyers to make up for lost American orders – the problem has not gone away.\n\nThe thinking is that with such geopolitical uncertainty, this is the time for China to turn to its huge domestic population to give its economy a shot in the arm.\n\nAccording to the official readout from this Plenum, it has been determined that the country \"should build a robust domestic market and work faster to foster a new pattern of development\".\n\nBut how?\n\nThese five-year-plan documents are usually more of a broad vision for the economy, rather than a specific set of measures. However, many analysts say that nothing has emerged from this meeting to indicate that the government has any fresh ideas to actually drive domestic consumption.\n\nIn short, how do you get people to save less and spend more when they are worried about the real estate crisis and high youth unemployment?\n\nThe Party can talk about \"building a robust domestic market\" but it needs solid solutions."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgk2ppvl5wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:29:01.896+00:00","title":"Louvre attendant recalls shock of heist: 'I yelled to get out'","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thieves broke into the Louvre’s Gallery of Apollo using an angle grinder to shatter a reinforced window, stealing high-value historical jewelry including a necklace from Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem from Empress Eugenie, valued at €88 million.

attendant recalls shock of heist: 'I yelled to get out'\n\nA gallery attendant on duty at the Louvre when thieves broke in and stole eight of France's crown jewels has said \"no-one could have been prepared\" for what unfolded as visitors began to arrive on Sunday morning.\n\n\"All of a sudden we heard an huge noise,\" she told radio station France Inter, in the first account given by an attendant at the scene.\n\nThe unnamed attendant and two colleagues initially thought the noise to be an angry visitor, but it was not a normal sound: \"It was a dull, slightly metallic noise.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, the moment thieves had used an angle grinder to burst through a reinforced window into the Gallery of Apollo, where the Louvre's collection of historic jewelry is kept.\n\nWithin eight minutes, the gang seized treasures, including a necklace that belonged to Napoleon's wife Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugenie, worth an estimated total of €88m (£77m).\n\nThe thieves used a mechanical ladder on the back of a lorry to lift them to a first-floor balcony to gain entry to the gallery.\n\nTwo tourists ran towards them in panic, she said.\n\n\"I saw one of the criminals turn around with something that looked to me like a chainsaw, then I yelled at my colleagues to get out,\" she recalled. She shouted a second time that it was a robbery and that they should run.\n\nOne of her colleagues raised the alarm over a walkie-talkie and then \"we finished evacuating the visits without quite realising really what was going on\". They shut all the doors as they left to protect the neighbouring galleries.\n\nOn reflection, the attendant said \"for us it was unbelievable the display cases could have been broken... never for a moment did we think there was such a risk... nobody can be prepared for that\".\n\nAnother Louvre employee came forward to describe the moments after the gang escaped.\n\nThe anonymous security guard spoke of a very strong smell of petrol as he arrived at the scene outside the Louvre where the gang had parked their lorry.\n\n\"I ran outside through the [glass] pyramid and across the courtyard... I got there at the very moment the criminals got away by scooter,\" he told BFMTV.\n\nThe gang had ruptured the lorry's fuel tank and there was a blowtorch near by, he said. \"It's clear they intended to set fire to their vehicle. I genuinely think we thwarted their plan because they would never have left behind so much evidence.\"\n\n\"They even lost one of the pieces they'd meant to steal, because they'd lost [Empress] Eugenie's crown, which they'd just stolen and it had fallen on the ground.\"\n\nThe security guard and his colleagues were the first to find the crown, he said: \"I can't say I jumped for joy, especially because the piece had obviously been damaged.\"\n\nThe director of the museum, Laurence des Cars, said the empress's crown appeared to have been damaged when the gang prised it out of a narrow gap they had cut in one of the two display cases with an angle grinder.\n\nShe told French senators this week that initial indications were that \"delicate restoration\" would be possible for the 19th-Century crown inlaid with diamonds and emeralds.\n\nAlthough French ministers insist security at the museum had worked properly on the day, the Louvre director has spoken of years of underfunding and of just one external security camera, facing the wrong way, where the break-in took place.\n\nHer damning assessment was backed up by the attendant, who complained that \"for some time we've felt the culture of security is in decline at the museum\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ex80zp2no","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:07:30.492+00:00","title":"Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings: Ghana's former first lady dies aged 76","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings, Ghana’s former First Lady and a prominent women’s rights advocate, has died at the age of 76.

over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation.\n\nThe advert, sponsored by the government of Canada's province of Ontario, quoted Trump's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, an icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".\n\nTrump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".\n\nHis administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.\n\nTrump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that he negotiated during his first term.\n\nBut Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has since his election earlier this year attempted to strike a deal that would ease the US tariffs.\n\nThis has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.\n\nIn the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.\n\nThe video excerpts a  1987 national radio address  by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.\n\n\"When someone says, 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\n\n\"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\n\n\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.\n\nIt said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.\n\nThe foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".\n\nTrump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on  whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal .\n\nThe court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.\n\nWhile the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words.\n\nThe order in which he makes the comments has been changed. The advert's penultimate sentence is taken from near the beginning of his speech, and a phrase that features about halfway through the advert is likewise taken from an earlier point in the address.\n\nThe original address - titled Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - is regarding a specific set of tariffs the Reagan administration had at the time imposed on some Japanese goods.\n\nReagan seeks to use the speech explain why he had introduced the tariffs in this \"special case\" despite his belief that \"imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take\".\n\nHe makes clear that he wants to lift them as soon as possible \"to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\" - a position he stresses throughout the speech.\n\nThe advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.\n\nIn a  post accompanying the advert , Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".\n\nChina's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip  in a post on X  to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.\n\nOntario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs.\n\nFord hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to  cut off power supply  to the US.\n\nHe had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \" yanked it into us \", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.\n\nTrump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.\n\nThe White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.\n\nCarney and Ford have not yet commented on Trump's announcement.\n\nIt is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would  impose a digital services tax on US technology firms  earlier this year.\n\nWhen Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had  \"caved\" to pressure from Trump ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz3r46e37o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:02:31.496+00:00","title":"Gaza doctors investigate 'signs of torture' on unnamed dead returned by Israel","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Under the terms of Donald Trump’s ceasefire deal, Israel has returned 195 bodies to Gaza in exchange for 11 Israeli hostages and two foreign nationals.

Israel\n\nOut of a single room, with no DNA testing facilities or cold storage units of its own, the forensics team at Gaza's Nasser hospital face the challenges brought by peace.\n\nOver the past eleven days, 195 bodies have been returned to Gaza by Israeli authorities, in exchange for the bodies of 11 Israeli hostages, under the terms of Donald Trump's ceasefire deal. Two other bodies – those of Tanzanian and Thai hostages – have also been returned.\n\nPhotographs released by Gaza's medical authorities show some of the bodies badly decomposed, and arriving in civilian clothes or naked except for underwear, some with multiple signs of injury. Many have their wrists tied behind their backs, and doctors say some bodies arrived blindfolded or with cloth roped around their necks.\n\nThe forensic team at Nasser hospital are working with almost no resources to answer vast questions about torture, mistreatment and identity.\n\nThe head of the unit, Dr Ahmed Dheir, said one of their biggest limitations is a lack of cold storage space. The bodies arrive in Gaza thoroughly frozen and can take several days to thaw out, ruling out even basic identification methods like dental history, let alone any deeper investigation or post-mortem (autopsy).\n\n\"The situation is extremely challenging,\" he said. \"If we wait for the bodies to thaw, rapid decomposition begins almost immediately, putting us in an impossible position [because] we lose the ability to examine the remains properly. So the most viable method is to take samples and document the state of the bodies as they are.\"\n\nThe BBC has viewed dozens of photographs of the bodies, many of them shared by Gaza's health authorities, others taken by colleagues on the ground.\n\nWe spoke to several of those involved in examining the bodies in Gaza, as well as families of the missing, human rights groups, and Israeli military and prison authorities.\n\nWe also spoke to three forensic experts outside the region, including one specialising in torture, to educate ourselves about the medical processes involved in this kind of investigation – all agreed that there were questions that were difficult to answer without post-mortems.\n\nDr Alaa al-Astal, one of the forensic team at Nasser hospital, said some of the bodies arriving there showed \"signs of torture\", such as bruises and marks from binding on the wrists and ankles.\n\n\"There were extremely horrific cases, where the restraint was so tight that blood circulation to the hands was cut off, leading to tissue damage and clear signs of pressure around the wrists and ankles,\" he said.\n\n\"Even around the eyes, when the blindfolds were removed, you could see deep grooves - imagine how much force that took. The pressure left actual marks where the blindfold had been tied.\"\n\nDr Astal also mentioned the loose cloths tied around the necks of some bodies as needing further investigation.\n\n\"In one case, there was a groove around the neck,\" he said. \"To determine whether the death was due to hanging or strangulation, we needed to perform a post-mortem, but because the body was frozen, it was not dissected.\"\n\nSameh Yassin Hamad, a member of the Hamas-run government committee responsible for receiving the bodies, said there were signs of bruising and blood infiltration indicating that the bodies had been severely beaten before death. He also said there were stab wounds on the chest or face of some of them.\n\nSome of the images we saw from the unit clearly show deep indentations or tightly-fastened cable-ties on the wrists and arms and ankles. One photograph appears to show the bruising and abrasion that would confirm that ties had been used while the person was still alive.\n\nOther bodies showed only deep indentation marks, meaning a post-mortem would be needed to determine whether the ties had been used before or after death. Cable-ties are sometimes used when transporting bodies in Israel.\n\nWhen we asked Israel's military about the evidence we gathered, it said it operates strictly in accordance with international law.\n\nWe showed the photographs we were given to the outside forensic experts. The images represent a fraction of the bodies transferred to Gaza by the Red Cross.\n\nAll three experts said that some of the markings raised questions about what had happened, but that it was difficult to reach concrete conclusions about abuse or torture without  post-mortems.\n\n\"What is happening in Gaza is an international forensic emergency,\" said Michael Pollanen, a forensic pathologist and professor at the University of Toronto. \"Based upon images like this, there is an imperative for complete medical autopsies.  We need to know the truth behind how deaths occurred, and the only way to know the truth is to do autopsies.\"\n\nBut even with limited forensic data, doctors at Nasser hospital say the routine cuffing of wrists behind the body rather than in front, along with the marks observed on the limbs, points to torture.\n\n\"When a person is naked, with their hands tied behind their back, and visible restraint marks on their wrists and ankles, it indicates that they died in that position,\" Dr Dheir told us. \"This is a violation of international law.\"\n\nAnd there is strong evidence to suggest widespread abuse of detainees - including civilians - in Israeli custody in the months after the war began in October 2023, particularly in the military facility of Sde Teiman.\n\n\"At least in the first eight months of the war, the detainees from Gaza were cuffed behind their backs, and had their eyes covered, 24 hrs, 7 days a week, for months,\" said Naji Abbas, head of the Prisoners and Detainees Programme at the Israeli human rights organisation, Physicians for Human Rights (PHRI).\n\n\"We know that people developed serious infections on their skin, hands and legs because of the cuffs.\"\n\nWe have spoken to several people who worked at Sde Teiman over the past two years, who confirm that detainees were cuffed hand and foot – even while undergoing medical treatments, including surgery.\n\nOne medic who worked there said he had campaigned to loosen the cuffs, and that the treatment of detainees there was \"dehumanisation\".\n\nBut many of those detained during the Gaza war are held as unlawful combatants, without charge.\n\nOne complication for doctors at Nasser Hospital now is determining which of the returned bodies are Hamas fighters killed in combat, which are civilians and which are detainees who died in Israeli custody.\n\nSome of the bodies returned by Israel are still wearing Hamas headbands or military boots, but doctors say most are either naked or in civilian clothing, making it difficult to distinguish their role, interpret their injuries, and assess human rights violations.\n\nPhotographs seen by the BBC show mostly naked or decomposed bodies. One dressed in civilian clothing and trainers has what officials say are two small bullet wounds in his back.\n\nSameh Yassin Hamad, from Gaza's Forensics Committee, said that Israel had sent back identification with only six of the 195 bodies it had returned – and that five of those names turned out to be wrong.\n\n\"Since these bodies were held by the Israeli authorities, they will have full data about them,\" said Dr Dheir. \"But they haven't shared that information with us through the Red Cross. We were sent DNA profiles for around half the total number of dead, but have not received any details about the dates or circumstances of death, or the time or place of detention.\"\n\nWe asked Israel's army about the details in this report, including striking allegations by Gaza's forensic team that Israel had removed single fingers and toes from the bodies for DNA testing.\n\nIsrael's military said \"all bodies returned so far are combatants within the Gaza Strip.\"  It denied tying any bodies prior to their release.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Shosh Bedrosian, on Wednesday described the reports from Gaza as \"just more efforts to demonise Israel\" and suggested the media focus instead on the experience of Israeli hostages.\n\nAs families of those missing gather at the hospital gates, Dr Dheir and his staff are under intense pressure to identify the dead and provide answers about what happened to them.\n\nSo far, only some 50 bodies have been positively identified – mostly through basic details like height, age and obvious previous injuries.  Another 54 have been buried, unidentified and unclaimed, because of intense pressure on space at the unit.\n\nMany families of the missing attended the burial of the unnamed dead this week, just in case one of them was theirs.\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard to bury a body when you don't know whether it's the right one or not,\" said Rami al-Faraa, still searching for his cousin.\n\n\"If there was [DNA] testing, we'd know where he is – yes or no,\" said Houwaida Hamad, searching for her nephew.  \"My sister would know if the one we're burying is really her son or not.\"\n\nDonald Trump's ceasefire deal has brought some relief for Gaza, but little closure for the families of most of those missing, left burying a body in place of a brother, husband or son.\n\nCorrection 24 October 2025: An earlier version of this story said the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages had been returned. This has been amended to a figure of 11 Israeli bodies, as well as that of one Tanzanian and one Thai."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"21:41:17.423+00:00","title":"Drug crackdown or regime change - what is Trump's goal in Venezuela?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying warships, fighter jets, bombers, drones, and special forces near Venezuela.

It is the largest deployment there for decades.\n\nLong-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out \"bomber attack demonstrations\" off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela too, as tensions have escalated.\n\nThe US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry \"narcotics\" and \"narco-terrorists\", without providing evidence or details about those on board.\n\nThe strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. They are being sold by the US as a war on drug trafficking but all the signs suggest this is really an intimidation campaign that seeks to remove Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro from power.\n\n\"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank.\n\nHe argues the military build-up is a show of strength intended to \"strike fear\" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.\n\nBBC Verify has been monitoring publicly available tracking information from US ships and planes in the region - along with satellite imagery and images on social media - to try to build a picture of where Trump's forces are located.\n\nThe deployment has been changing, so we have been monitoring the region regularly for updates.\n\nAs of 23 October, we identified 10 US military ships in the region, including guided missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and oil tankers for refuelling vessels at sea.\n\nIt is no secret that the US administration, particularly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would like to see Maduro toppled.\n\nEarlier this year, he told Fox News Maduro was a \"horrible dictator\" and when asked whether he was demanding that Maduro leave, added: \"We're going to work on that policy.\"\n\nBut, even for overt critics of Maduro like Rubio, it is difficult to explicitly call for military-backed regime change - something Venezuela's opposition has longed called for.\n\nDonald Trump campaigned against regime change in 2016, pledging to \"stop racing to topple foreign regimes\", and more recently has condemned engaging in \"forever wars.\"\n\nThe US does not recognise Maduro as the president of Venezuela, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed internationally, and by the opposition in Venezuela, as neither free nor fair. The US embassy in Caracas was closed during Trump's first presidency in 2019.\n\nThe US has upped its bounty for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m, an incentive for those within his loyal, inner circle to hand him in. But it has yielded no defections.\n\nVenezuelan law professor and senior associate at the CSIS national security think tank, Jose Ignacio Hernández, says $50m is \"nothing\" for Venezuela's elites.\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made through corruption within an oil-rich state like Venezuela. The former head of Treasury Alejandro Andrade, made $1bn in bribes before he was convicted.\n\nMany analysts agree the Venezuelan military would be key to any regime change, but for them to turn on Maduro and oust him, they would also likely want promises of immunity from prosecution.\n\nMr Hernández adds: \"They will think, in some way or another I am involved in criminal activities too.\"\n\nMichael Albertus, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who publishes extensively on Latin America, is not convinced that even a bounty of $500m would persuade Maduro's inner circle to turn him in.\n\n\"Authoritarian leaders are always suspicious of even their inner circle, and because of that, they create mechanisms for monitoring them and ensuring loyalty,\" he said.\n\nEconomic sanctions on Venezuela have exacerbated the already severe economic crisis, but have not succeeded in persuading senior figures to turn against their president.\n\nDonald Trump has declared this is a war on narcotics traffickers and said one vessel the US struck, on 16 October, was \"loaded up with mostly fentanyl.\"\n\nBut fentanyl is primarily produced in Mexico - not South America - and comes into the US over the southern border.\n\n\"It isn't about drugs,\" says Dr Sabatini. \"But he's co-opted the Venezuelan opposition's language of how this is not just a dictatorship - it's a criminal regime.\"\n\nSince 2020, the US Justice Department has accused President Maduro of leading a drug trafficking and narco-terrorism organisation, which he denies. Trump has said he has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela in part because of \"drugs coming in\" from Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela does not produce large quantities of cocaine - that's mainly Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. There is some cocaine trafficked through Venezuela, which its own government claims it is cracking down on.\n\nA US Drug Enforcement Administration report from 2025 says 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia and mentioned other countries but not Venezuela in its cocaine section.\n\nThe first seven strikes were carried out in the Caribbean, which is not a major sea route for drug-trafficking compared with the Pacific Ocean, where the subsequent strikes were carried out.\n\nThe US has not detailed its evidence of Maduro leading a drug trafficking organisation. Maduro has repeatedly denied the accusations, and for his part accuses the US of imperialism and worsening the country's economic crisis through sanctions.\n\nThere are known cases of those close to him being indicted.\n\nIn 2016, a New York federal court convicted the two nephews of his wife for conspiring to import cocaine to the US. The case said they planned to use some of the money to fund his wife's political campaign. They were later freed.\n\nIntercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one, according to military analysts.\n\nAs well as the US ships we tracked around Puerto Rico - where the US has a military base - satellite imagery also showed two vessels about 75 miles (123km) east of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nOne was a guided missile cruiser, the USS Lake Erie.\n\nThe other appeared to be the MV Ocean Trader according to Bradley Martin, a former US Navy captain, now a senior policy researcher at RAND Corp.\n\nThis is a converted cargo ship designed to support special forces missions while blending in with commercial traffic. It can house drones, helicopters, and small boats.\n\nThere are a wide variety of missions it could conceivably support, including reconnaissance to prepare for strikes. But Mr Martin stresses that its presence \"doesn't necessarily mean that those kinds of activities are being carried out or are planned\".\n\nThe US has bolstered its air presence in the region - BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.\n\nStu Ray, a senior analyst at McKenzie Intelligence Services, says a satellite image taken on 17 October shows F-35 fighter jets on the tarmac, possibly F-35Bs.\n\nThese are highly advanced stealth jets prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability.\n\nOn social media, a private jet pilot shared a video of a MQ-9 Reaper drone, filmed at Rafael Hernández Airport on Puerto Rico.\n\nThese have been used by the US to carry out attacks and surveillance in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya and Mali.\n\nEarlier in October, BBC Verify tracked three B-52 bombers which flew across the Caribbean and close to Venezuela's coast.\n\nThe US air force later confirmed that the planes had taken part in a \"bomber attack demonstration\".\n\nFlights of B1 bombers and P-8 Poseidon spy planes have also been visible on plane tracking platforms.\n\nImages on social media have also shown military helicopters operating off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nSome of these are Boeing MH-6M Little Birds - nicknamed \"Killer Eggs\" - used by US special forces.\n\nWhen asked if the CIA had been given the authority to take out Maduro, Donald Trump dodged the question and said it would be \"ridiculous\" to answer.\n\nHe has also said that the US is \"looking at land now\", referring to possible military operations on Venezuelan soil.\n\nThe CIA is viewed with a lot of suspicion by many in Latin America because of a long history of covert interventions, attempts at regime-change, and support for past right-wing military dictatorships, notably in Chile and Brazil.\n\nNed Price, deputy to the US representative to the United Nations and formerly a CIA senior analyst and State Department senior adviser, said CIA covert action can take \"many forms.\"\n\n\"It can be information operations. It can be sabotage operations. It can be funding opposition parties. It can go as far as the overthrow of a regime. There are a lot of options between the low-end and high-end option.\"\n\nThis could include agents being used to target trafficking suspects inside Venezuela. By the US's own definition, this could include Maduro himself.\n\nDr Sabatini says given Venezuela isn't a major production point for drugs, there are no cocaine or fentanyl labs to \"take out\" but there are airstrips or ports which the US could target.\n\n\"If he wants to be aggressive, he could send a missile to a military barrack. There is pretty good intelligence certain sectors of the military are involved in cocaine trafficking.\"\n\nOr it could be a \"smash and grab situation\", he notes, where they attempt to seize Maduro or some of his lieutenants and bring them to justice in the US.\n\nThe big question, he argues, is how long Trump is willing to keep so many US assets parked in the Caribbean.\n\nIf the prime purpose of this military build-up is to threaten Maduro, it is unclear whether it is enough to prompt defections.\n\nWhether that goes as far as an actual attempt to dislodge the Maduro regime through force, ponders Professor Albertus, it is hard to know."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnve5532v7yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"17:49:14.597+00:00","title":"Rosenberg: Trump abandons carrot and wields stick over Putin in Ukraine talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a reversal of his previous diplomatic strategy, former US President Donald Trump has cancelled a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, shifting from offering diplomatic 'carrots' to imposing economic sanctions on major Russian oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil.

2025-10-23T17:49:14.597+00:00\n\nTitle: Rosenberg: Trump abandons carrot and wields stick over Putin in Ukraine talks\n\nOne week ago I had the distinct feeling it was Groundhog Day, or as the Russians call it,  Dyen Surka.\n\nAmid US threats to pressure Moscow - by supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine - Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump held a telephone call. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Budapest.\n\nLast August, amid threats of additional US sanctions against Russia, Putin met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Alaska.\n\nDéjà vu.\n\nBut Groundhog Day seems to be over.\n\nThe Alaska meeting went ahead, with minimal preparation and little result.\n\nBut the Budapest summit is off. It barely had time to be \"on\", to be fair. Now President Trump has cancelled it.\n\n\"It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get,\" the US president told reporters.\n\nAnd that's not all.\n\nPreviously, Trump had not followed through on threats of more pressure on Russia, preferring carrots to sticks in his dealings with the Kremlin.\n\nFor the moment he has put his carrots away.\n\nInstead he's imposed sanctions on two major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nThat's unlikely to force a U-turn on the war from President Putin. But it's a sign of Trump's frustration with the Kremlin's unwillingness to make any compromise or concessions to end the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russians don't take kindly to sticks.\n\nOn Thursday, President Putin told reporters that the new US sanctions were an \"unfriendly act\" and an attempt to put pressure on Russia.\n\n\"But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decide anything under pressure.\"\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was less diplomatic.\n\n\"The USA is our enemy and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully set on the path to war with Russia,\" he wrote on social media. \"The decisions that have been taken are an act of war against Russia.\"\n\nThursday morning's edition of the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets was slightly less dramatic, but obviously unflattering. The paper criticised \"the capriciousness and fickleness of [Russia's] main negotiating partner.\"\n\nSo what's changed?\n\nInstead of rushing off to summit no. 2, as he had done for summit no.1, this time around President Trump was slightly more cautious.\n\nHe had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay the groundwork for the summit with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to make sure there was a point in decamping to Budapest.\n\nIt soon became clear that there wasn't, and that a new summit now was unlikely to produce a breakthrough.\n\nRussia is fiercely opposed to Donald Trump's idea of freezing the current battle lines in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin is determined to take control, at the very least, of the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It has seized and occupied much of it.\n\nBut President Volodymyr Zelensky is refusing to cede to Russia those parts of the Donbas that Ukraine still controls.\n\nMoscow would have welcomed a second US-Russia summit.\n\nThe first, in Alaska, was a diplomatic and political coup for the Kremlin. The red-carpet welcome in Anchorage for President Putin symbolised Russia's return to the international stage and the West's failure to isolate Moscow.\n\nOver the last week Russian state media have been savouring the idea of a summit with President Trump in Europe, but without the European Union at the table. Russian commentators portrayed the proposed meeting in Budapest as a slap in the face for Brussels.\n\nAt the same time, few here seemed to believe that, even if it went ahead, the Budapest summit would produce the kind of result Moscow wanted.\n\nSome Russian newspapers have been calling for the Russian army to continue fighting.\n\n\"There isn't a single reason Moscow should agree to a ceasefire,\" declared Moskovsky Komsomolets yesterday.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Kremlin doesn't want peace.\n\nIt does.

He is expected to prepare a substantial bond for his release, too.\n\nHis lawyer Chris Heywood also denied the accusations, telling CBS in a statement: \"He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court.\"\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel held a news conference with other prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday where he announced the two indictments.\n\nHe called the arrests \"extraordinary\" and said there was a \"co-ordinated takedown across 11 states\".\n\n\"We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation,\" he said.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Joseph Nocella Jr, said all defendants were innocent until proven guilty, but warned: \"Your winning streak has ended. Your luck has run out.\"\n\nProsecutors said the first case involved players and associates who allegedly used  information not available to the public to manipulate bets on major gambling platforms.\n\nNocella called it \"one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalised\".\n\nSeven NBA games between February 2023 and March 2024 have been identified as part of the case. Rozier is said to have been involved in one between the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans, when he was playing for the Hornets.\n\nRozier is alleged to have told a friend that he would leave the game early due to injury. The friend and his associates then placed bets, or directed others to bet, \"more than $200,000\" that Rozier would underperform expectations in the game, prosecutors said.\n\nHe left the game after nine minutes, they said, which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in betting profits for those involved.\n\nDuring the game, Rozier scored just five points before going off because of a sore right foot, according to the official NBA match report.\n\nBefore that game, he averaged 35 minutes of playing time and about 21 points per game.\n\n\"As the NBA season tips off, his career is already benched, not for injury but for integrity,\" New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.\n\nRozier's lawyer James Trusty said in a statement that prosecutors \"appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case\".\n\nMr Trusty said he had been representing Rozier for more than a year and said prosecutors characterised Rozier as a subject, not a target, until they informed him FBI agents were arresting the player at a hotel on Thursday morning.\n\nFormer NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested as part of the investigation.\n\nJones is said to have been involved in two of the identified games - when the Los Angeles Lakers met the Milwaukee Bucks in February 2023, and a January 2024 game between the Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nSports betting was outlawed in most of the US from 1992 until 2018, when the Supreme Court turned regulation of the practice over to the states.\n\nSince the federal ban was struck down, sports betting has exploded with major sports leagues and media companies making deals with gambling firms to get in on the billion-dollar industry.\n\nThe second indictment announced on Thursday involves 31 defendants alleged to have participated in  a scheme to rig illegal poker games  and steal millions of dollars.\n\nThe case involved 13 members and associates of the Bonanno, Genovese and Gambino crime families in New York.\n\nNocella said the targeted victims were lured to play games with former professional athletes, including Billups and Jones, in Las Vegas, Miami, Manhattan and the Hamptons.\n\nVictims were \"fleeced\" out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game, he said.\n\nHe said defendants used \"very sophisticated technology\" like altered off-the-shelf shuffling machines that could read the cards. Some of the defendants used special contact lenses and glasses to read marked cards, and an X-ray table that could read cards when they were face-down.\n\n\"What [the victims] didn't know is that everybody else at the poker game - from the dealer to the players were in on the scam,\" Nocella said.\n\nTisch said that, when people refused to pay, the organised crime families used threats and intimidation to get them to hand over the money.\n\nThe charges include robbery, extortion, wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal gambling.\n\nThe conspiracy cheated victims out of $7m, with one losing $1.8 million, officials said.\n\n\"This is only the tip of the iceberg,\" Christopher Raia, the FBI assistant director of the New York field office, said, adding that the FBI was working hard to ensure members of mafia families \"cannot continue to wreak havoc in our communities\"."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/trump-james-shame-campaign.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"03:00:19-04:00","title":"Letitia James Case Shows Ruthlessness of Justice Dept. in Trump’s Grip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that the U.S. Justice Department has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James, as part of a broader political campaign under President Trump’s second term.

scam\n\nJust 37 years old, Chen Zhi is accused of being \"the mastermind behind a sprawling cyber-fraud empire… a criminal enterprise built on human suffering\".\n\nWith his wispy goatee beard and baby-faced features, he looks even younger than he is. He has certainly become very wealthy, very quickly.\n\nLast week the US Department of Justice  charged him with running scam compounds in Cambodia that stole billions  in cryptocurrency from victims all over the world. The US Treasury Department has confiscated about $14bn (£10.5bn) worth of bitcoin that it says is linked to him - it said this was the largest ever crypto-currency seizure.\n\nHis own company, the Cambodian Prince Group, describes him on its website as \"a respected entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist\" whose \"vision and leadership have transformed Prince Group into a leading business group in Cambodia that adheres to international standards\". The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment.\n\nSo, how much do we know about Chen Zhi, the mysterious figure allegedly running a scam empire?\n\nBrought up in Fujian province in south-eastern China, he started with a small, and apparently not very successful internet gaming company, and moved to Cambodia in either late 2010 or 2011, where he began working in the then-booming real estate sector.\n\nHis arrival coincided with the start of a speculative property boom in Cambodia. It was fuelled by the availability of large tracts of land expropriated by powerful, politically-connected figures and by a flood of Chinese capital.\n\nSome of it was pouring in on the tail end of Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative to export Chinese-made infrastructure, and some of it was from individual Chinese investors seeking more affordable alternatives to China's overheated property market. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Cambodia was also rising fast.\n\nThe skyline of the capital Phnom Penh changed dramatically. The characterful, low-rise cityscape of mustard-coloured French colonial mansions was transformed into another Asian high-rise forest of glass and steel towers.\n\nThe transformation of Sihanoukville, a once quiet little seaside resort, was even more extreme. It was not just Chinese holidaymakers and property speculators heading there, but also gamblers - gambling is illegal in China.\n\nNew casinos sprang up, alongside gaudy, luxury hotels and apartment blocks. There was plenty of money to be made.\n\nEven so, Chen Zhi's trajectory was startling.\n\nIn 2014 he became a Cambodian citizen, giving up his Chinese nationality. This enabled him to buy land in his own name, but required a minimum investment or donation to the government of $250,000.\n\nIt was never clear where Chen Zhi's money came from. When applying for a bank account on the Isle of Man in 2019 he listed an unnamed uncle who he said had given him $2m to start his first property company in 2011, but no evidence for this was ever provided.\n\nChen Zhi founded the Prince Group in 2015, focused on property development, when he was still only 27 years old.\n\nHe got a commercial banking licence in 2018 to establish Prince Bank. The same year he obtained a Cypriot passport, in return for a minimum investment there of $2.5m, giving him easy access to the European Union. He later acquired Vanuatu citizenship as well.\n\nHe started Cambodia's third airline, and in 2020 obtained a certificate to operate a fourth. There were luxury malls in Phnom Penh built by the Prince property arm, five-star hotels in Sihanoukville, and an ambitious scheme to construct a $16bn  \"eco-city\" called \"Bay of Lights\" there.\n\nIn 2020 Chen Zhi was awarded the highest title bestowed by Cambodia's king, that of \"Neak Oknha\", which requires a donation of at least $500,000 to the government.\n\nHe had already been made an official adviser to Interior Minister Sar Kheng since 2017, was a business partner with his son Sar Sokha, and an official adviser to Cambodia's most powerful man Hun Sen, and later his son Hun Manet after he succeeded his father as prime minister in 2023.\n\nChen Zhi was lauded in the local media as a philanthropist, who had funded scholarships for low-income students and donated substantially to help Cambodia deal with the Covid pandemic.\n\nYet he remained an enigmatic figure, staying out of the limelight, making few public statements.\n\n\"Everyone I've spoken to who's worked with him directly, been in the room with him, they all describe him as very courteous, very calm, very measured,\" says Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who did a three year-long investigation of Chen Zhi which was published by Radio Free Asia last year.\n\n\"I think not being the kind of flamboyant person that people will write tabloid-y things about was smart. Even those who no longer want to be associated with him are still impressed by his quiet charisma, his gravitas.\"\n\nBut where was all this wealth and power coming from?\n\nIn 2019 the property bubble burst in Sihanoukville. The online gambling business had attracted Chinese criminal syndicates, who then began violent turf wars with each other. Tourists were scared off.\n\nUnder pressure from China, then-prime minister Hun Sen banned online gambling in August that year. Around 450,000 Chinese left the city as its main business collapsed. Many of Prince Group's residential blocks were left empty.\n\nYet Chen Zhi continued to expand his business interests and spend freely.\n\nAccording to the UK authorities, in 2019 he bought a £12m mansion in north London and a £95m office block in the city's financial district. The US says he and his associates bought properties in New York, private jets and superyachts, and a Picasso painting.\n\nAnd, they allege, Chen Zhi's wealth came from the most profitable business in Asia today, online fraud, and the human trafficking and money laundering that go with it.\n\nThe US and UK have imposed sanctions on 128 companies linked to Chen Zhi and Prince Group, and on 17 individuals from seven different nationalities who they allege helped run his scam empire. Assets linked to Chen Zhi in the US and UK have been frozen.\n\nThe sanctions announcement describes an elaborate web of shell companies and cryptocurrency wallets through which money was moved to conceal its origins.\n\nIt says: \"Prince Group Transnational Crime Organisation profits from a litany of transnational crimes including sextortion - a type of fraud involving the solicitation for eventual blackmail of sexually explicit materials, often from minors - money laundering, various frauds and rackets, corruption, illegal online gambling, and the industrial-scale trafficking, torture, and extortion of enslaved workers in furtherance of the operation of at least 10 scam compounds in Cambodia.\"\n\nChina too had been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. There have been a number of court cases accusing the company of running online fraud schemes.\n\nThe Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has established a task force \"to investigate the \"Prince Group, a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia\".\n\nAt its heart, the US and UK allege, were businesses like Golden Fortune Science and Technology Park, a compound built by the Prince Group in Chrey Thom, close to the Vietnamese border.\n\nIn the past the Prince Group has denied any involvement in scams, and said it no longer has any connection to Golden Fortune, but the US and UK investigation argues that there is still a clear business link between them.\n\nMr Adamovic Davies interviewed a number of people living and working near Golden Fortune for his investigation into Chen Zhi. They described brutal beatings of the mainly Chinese, Vietnamese and Malaysians who tried to escape from the compound, where they were forced to run online scams.\n\n\"I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,\" he says, adding that it is shocking the Prince Group was able to build a \"global footprint\" without raising alarm bells given the serious criminal charges it now faces.\n\n\"What should be uncomfortable for a lot of people is that Chen Zhi should never have been able to acquire all these assets, in Singapore, London or the US. Lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, bankers, all should have been looking at this group and saying, hang on, this doesn't add up. And they didn't.\"\n\nToday, after all the publicity generated by the US and UK sanctions, businesses are rushing to dissociate themselves from the Prince Group.\n\nThe Cambodian Central Bank has had to issue a statement to nervous depositors assuring them they will be able to withdraw their funds from Prince Bank. The South Korean authorities have frozen $64m of its deposits held by Korean banks.\n\nThe Singapore and Thai governments are promising investigations into Prince subsidiaries in their jurisdictions - of the 18 individuals targeted by the US and UK, three are Singaporeans.\n\nCambodia's government has said little, apart from urging the US and UK authorities to be sure they have sufficient evidence for their allegations.\n\nBut it will be difficult for Cambodia's ruling elite to distance themselves from Chen Zhi, after being so close to him for so long. Cambodia was already facing growing pressure over its tolerance of scam businesses, which some estimate may account for around half of the entire economy.\n\nAnd what of Chen Zhi himself?\n\nNothing has been heard or seen of him since the sanctions were announced last week.

Since 1968, sea temperatures around the country have risen by 1.58°C — more than double the global average — leading to more extreme weather, including stronger storms and unpredictable wind gusts. These changes have caused fish species like silvery hairtail and anchovies to migrate, forcing fishermen to travel farther and deeper into dangerous waters. As a result, fishing operations have become riskier, with a 75% increase in deaths and missing persons in sea accidents over the past year. The government has identified climate change as a key driver, alongside poor safety training, reliance on untrained foreign labor, and inadequate vessel maintenance. Experts and fishermen report a deepening crisis: declining catches, financial hardship, and loss of tradition. The UN forecasts a 30% drop in total fish catches by century’s end, and efforts to support fishermen — such as compensating for jellyfish removal or providing loans for squid fishermen — are being explored as mitigation strategies. The article underscores how climate change is not just a distant environmental issue, but a direct threat to livelihoods, safety, and cultural traditions in coastal

fishermen keep dying. Is climate change to blame?\n\nHong Suk-hui was waiting on the shore of South Korea's Jeju Island when the call came. His fishing boat had capsized.\n\nJust two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned.\n\n\"When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,\" said Mr Hong.\n\nLast year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats sunk or capsized.\n\n\"The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,\" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association.\n\n\"Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change.\"\n\nAlarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents.\n\nThis year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.\n\nThe seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C.\n\nWarming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense.\n\nThey are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to \"stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters\".\n\nOn a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations.\n\n\"I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,\" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. \"The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous.\"\n\nA few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half.\n\nNow his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan.\n\n\"Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,\" he said. \"If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.\"\n\nProfessor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024.\n\n\"Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,\" he told the BBC.\n\nProfessor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.\n\nOne foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled.\n\nAs he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes.\n\n\"In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,\" he said. \"But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish.\"\n\nThis is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.\n\nEven the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed.\n\n\"The haul is basically worthless,\" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages.\n\n\"The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,\" Park continued. \"I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading.\"\n\nAnd, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier.\n\nIncreasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers.\n\nWoojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as \"a vicious and tragic cycle\".\n\nWhen you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, \"you have a higher chance of meeting disaster\", she explained.\n\nOn 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Yeosu, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery.\n\nOne of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat.\n\n\"It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,\" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death.\n\nEan thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. \"Ultimately it is their call when to go out,\" she said.\n\nAs a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. \"Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,\" she said.\n\nEan also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. \"Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced.\"\n\nThe authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels.\n\nThe government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates.\n\nSome regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.\n\nBecause the problem will likely worsen.  The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation  forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories.\n\n\"The future looks very bleak,\" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last.\n\n\"Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.\"\n\n\"These days it's just really tough.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Hosu Lee and Leehyun Choi"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2de6wkd4qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:34.395+00:00","title":"Ivory Coast election: An ex-first lady, a tycoon and a 'safe pair of hands' vie for power","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ivory Coast's 2025 presidential election features a tense political landscape where incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, despite constitutional permission for a fourth term, faces strong opposition from several candidates.

dominates campaign rallies in Ivory Coast but the pulsing energy and fervour belies concerns about the political landscape in the world's largest cocoa producer.\n\nSaturday's presidential vote in the West African nation is as notable for the candidates who have been banned from running as for those who are vying for the top job.\n\nWhile incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, a hero to some for bringing growth over the last 15 years to a country following a brutal civil war, is facing a backlash from those who see the 83-year-old's fourth-term bid as a slap in the face to democracy - even though his candidacy is allowed by the constitution.\n\nProminent opposition leader Tidjane Thiam was disqualified in April after a court  ruled that he had forfeited his Ivorian citizenship when he became French in 1987 - a ruling that he disputed - while former President Laurent Gbagbo was barred because of a 2018 criminal conviction.\n\nIt was Gbagbo's refusal to accept defeat to Ouattara in a run-off vote in 2010 that sparked a post-election conflict that left more than 3,000 people dead and traumatised a nation vital to the global supply of chocolate.\n\nYet Ouattara, known to his supporters by his initials \"Ado\", still faces strong competition, especially from Gbagbo's former wife, and one of the country's richest man, popular with urban voters - but it is a divided opposition.\n\nThere are four candidates up against the octogenarian:\n\nDespite the economic progress under Ouattara, his opponents hope to capitalise on complaints from many of the country's poor, who are not feeling the benefits of the rapid growth.\n\n\"The economy is growing, but not for us,\" Billon, the business tycoon and youngest of all the candidates - representing the Democratic Congress (Code) - has said.\n\nDancing on stage during rallies in front of thousands of supporters in the political capital, Yamoussoukro, he has taken to doing judo moves to show he is \"ready for the job and full of energy\".\n\n\"Young people can't find jobs, and the cost of living is rising,\" says the politician, who is confident that if he gets into a second-round run-off with the incumbent, then \"Ouattara's time will be over\".\n\nBillon had been hoping to represent the centre-right Democratic Party (PDCI) of late President Henri Konan Bédié.\n\nBut in the end the party went for the now-disqualified Thiam - so without a candidate on the ballot paper, Billon feels sure he will get the backing of PDCI supporters.\n\n‎However, Simone Gbagbo, leader of the leftist Movement of Capable Generations (MGC), has also positioned herself as a voice for the disaffected - and believes those votes will come to her.\n\nAlways smiling and wearing traditional smart dresses, her energy sparks and she holds her mic like a pop star. A natural campaigner, she knows how to revitalise her supporters.\n\nThe former first lady, once dubbed \"the iron lady\" because of her reputation for toughness, is part of the CPA-CI, a coalition of opposition groups that came together earlier this year to protest against Ouattara's candidacy.\n\n\"President Ouattara has done some good things, but he destroyed education,\" she told her supporters recently.\n\nWith a background in education, academia and trade unions, her campaign has focused on rebuilding schools and offering better opportunities to young people.\n\n‎Despite such criticism, Ouattara's backers remain confident. His rallies seem a little bit less dynamic than in 2010, 2015 and 2020 - but they still attract many people of all ages.\n\nThe popular hit Coup du marteau (Hammer Blow) by Ivorian rapper Tam Paiya and featuring Team Paiya has become the unofficial anthem for his RHDP party with former prime ministers, ministers, MPs and other influential backers often seen dancing to it with energy.\n\n\"The president is in good shape and ready to serve again,\" says government spokesman Adama Coulibaly, pointing to major public works and investor confidence as proof of the country's stability.\n\nBut despite the change to the constitution in 2016 that allowed Ouattara to run for a third and fourth term, his candidacy this time round has sparked anger and the government has reacted to recent protests with a swift crackdown.\n\nMore than 700 demonstrators were arrested earlier this month following an opposition march and 50 sentenced to three years in jail.\n\n‎There is some concern that this could be the prelude to further disorder in the aftermath of the vote.\n\nThe memory of past political violence remains vivid - and to avoid any unrest, the security forces have been deployed across major cities.\n\nNevertheless many residents are taking precautions.\n\n\"We're leaving Abidjan a week before the vote,\" Ahoua Diomande, a mother of two, told the BBC.\n\n\"Each election brings fighting and deaths.\"\n\n‎‎But there are optimists too, like Charm Matuba, an Abidjan resident who originally hails from Congo-Brazzaville and has been closing following the campaign even though she cannot vote.\n\n\"I know everything will go well. Ivorians don't want to die again for politicians,\" she said.\n\n\"I just hope people will go to vote. All my friends support Simone. She's a leader, a true source of inspiration. She can create the surprise.\"\n\n‎‎Regional loyalties are likely to play a large role in this election, as they have done in the past.\n\nOuattara enjoys strong support in the north, where his base among Dioula-speaking communities remains loyal - and he opted to launch his campaign in the west where he has previously picked up votes.\n\nSimone Gbagbo also draws much of her backing from the west - and from the south-west too, historic strongholds of her ex-husband's former party.\n\nBillon appeals to urban voters and the central regions, promising to modernise the economy and foster generational change.\n\n\"He represents the young generation,\" said Salifou Sanogo, who is 19. \"It will be my first time voting and seriously, I know he will win. Ouattara is too old, tired and didn't do anything for us. We need change, we need Billon.\"\n\nThe endorsement of the excluded candidates would be significant but neither Thiam nor former President Gbagbo has backed anyone else.\n\nHowever, Simone Gbagbo is supported by Charles Blé Goudé, once a close ally of her former husband and who has opted not to put his hat in the ring.\n\n\"Bring Simone to the palace,\" the charismatic politician told thousands of his Young Patriot COJEP party supporters at one recent rally.\n\nAlong with the economy, foreign relations have also become a campaign issue.\n\nIvory Coast has taken a hard line against the military juntas in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, which now form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) and have sought closer ties with Russia.\n\nThese regimes accuse Ouattara of siding with France, their former colonial power, and pursuing a \"secret agenda\" on its behalf - which his government denies, maintaining it supports democratic governance in the region.\n\nBut the rhetoric has sharpened tensions with its northern neighbours. Some opposition candidates, including Ahoua Don Mello, have suggested that Ivory Coast should be \"open to new partnerships\" with Russia and China, arguing that the country must diversify its alliances.\n\nHis message has resonated in parts of western Ivory Coast, where anti-French sentiment runs deep.\n\nWhen fake news alleging that Ouattara had died trended on social media last march, the Ivorian authorities believe it started from the AES countries.\n\n‎‎As the noise and excitement of campaigns draw to a close, President Ouattara's supporters insist that continuity is the key to preserving stability and economic progress.\n\nHis critics argue that another term could deepen frustration and erode trust in democratic institutions - something that has dangerous echoes of the past.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y00g4x29o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:35:35.502+00:00","title":"Israel maintaining control deeper inside Gaza than expected, new boundary markers suggest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A BBC Verify analysis has found that Israeli forces are maintaining control over significantly more of Gaza than expected under the ceasefire agreement with Hamas.

control over more of Gaza than expected from the ceasefire deal with Hamas, a BBC Verify analysis has found.\n\nUnder the first stage of the deal, Israel agreed to retreat to a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. The divide was marked by a yellow line on maps released by the military and has become known as the \"Yellow Line\".\n\nBut new videos and satellite images show that markers placed by Israeli troops in two areas to mark the divide have been positioned hundreds of metres deeper inside the strip than the expected withdrawal line.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz - who instructed troops to place the yellow blocks as markers - warned that anyone crossing the line \"will be met with fire\". There have already been at least two deadly incidents near the boundary line.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground.\"\n\nThere has been a consistent  lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed , with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October.\n\nOn 14 October the IDF issued the latest version marking the Yellow Line on their online map, which is used to communicate its position to people in Gaza.\n\nBut in the north, near the al-Atatra neighbourhood, drone footage from the IDF showed that a line of six yellow blocks were up to 520m further inside the Strip than would have been expected from the IDF maps.\n\nFootage geolocated by BBC Verify showed workers using bulldozers and diggers to move the heavy yellow blocks and place them along the coastal al-Rashid road.\n\nA similar situation was visible in southern Gaza, where a satellite image taken on 19 October showed 10 markers erected near the city of Khan Younis. The line of blocks ranges between 180m-290m inside the Yellow Line set out by the IDF.\n\nIf these two sections of boundary were typical of how the markers were being placed along the entirety of the line then Israel would be exerting control over a notably larger area than expected from the ceasefire agreement.\n\nMultiple analysts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the blocks were intended to create a \"buffer zone\" between Palestinians and IDF personnel. One expert said the move would be consistent with a long-term \"strategic culture\" which seeks to insulate Israel from nearby territories it does not fully control.\n\n\"This gives the IDF space to manoeuvre and create a 'kill zone' against potential targets,\" Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London, said.\n\n\"Potential targets can be engaged before they reach the IDF perimeter. It is a bit like no man's land that does not belong to anyone – and Israel tends to take that territory from the opponent's chunk not its own.\"\n\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disparity between the markers and the IDF map was an intentional design to warn civilians they are \"approaching an area of increased risk\".\n\nNoam Ostfeld, an analyst with the risk consultancy Sibylline, said that some blocks \"seem to be positioned near roads or walls, making them easier to spot\".\n\nBut a post to X by the Israeli defense minister seemed to suggest that the yellow blocks marked the actual line, warning that \"any violation or attempt to cross the line will be met with fire\".\n\nThere is already confusion among Gazans over areas where it is safe to go.\n\nAbdel Qader Ayman Bakr, who lives near the temporary boundary in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shejaiya district, told the BBC that, despite promises from Israel of clear markings, he had seen none put in place.\n\n\"Each day, we can see Israeli military vehicles and soldiers at a relatively close distance, yet we have no way of knowing whether we are in what is considered a 'safe zone' or 'an active danger zone',\" he said.\n\n\"We are constantly exposed to danger, especially since we are forced to remain here because this is where our home once stood.\"\n\nSince the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF has reported a number of instances of people crossing the Yellow Line. On all occasions the IDF said it fired upon those involved.\n\nBBC Verify has obtained and geolocated footage showing the aftermath of one incident on 17 October, which the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said killed 11 civilians - including women and children all reportedly from the same family. The agency said the Palestinians' vehicle was targeted by Israel after crossing the Yellow Line east of Gaza City in the Zeitoun neighbourhood.\n\nThe footage showed rescue workers inspecting the burnt out remnants of a vehicle and covering a nearby badly-mangled body of a child with a white sheet. BBC Verify geolocated the video to a spot around 125m over the Yellow Line marked on maps by the IDF.\n\nThe IDF said warning shots were fired towards a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the line. The statement added when the vehicle failed to stop troops opened fire \"to remove the threat\".\n\nMeanwhile, the legal status of the boundary has also been questioned.\n\n\"Israel's obligations under the law of armed conflict do not cease even for those breaching the Yellow Line,\" said Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, professor of Public International Law at the University of Bristol.\n\n\"It can only target enemy fighters or those directly participating in hostilities, and in so doing it must not cause excessive civilian harm.\"\n\nIn a statement, an Israeli military spokesperson said: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command continue to operate to remove any threat to the troops and to defend the civilians of the State of Israel.\"\n\nThey added that the concrete blocks are \"being placed every 200 metres\".\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.\n\nAt least 68,280 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nAdditional reporting by Erwan Rivault, Lamees Altalebi and Maha El Gaml\n\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77zndkx5kpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"22:57:37.598+00:00","title":"How FBI's gambling case highlights Mafia's changing tactics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has unveiled a major investigation into illegal sports betting schemes allegedly involving the American mafia, including three of the Five Families — Gambinos, Bonnanos, and Genoveses.

2025-10-23T22:57:37.598+00:00\n\nTitle: How FBI's gambling case highlights Mafia's changing tactics\n\nWhen US officials unveiled two staggering illegal sports betting investigations on Thursday, they described the operations as something \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\".\n\nThe schemes, which allegedly involved NBA stars, specialised contact lenses, marked cards, an x-ray table and $7m (£5.2m) in losses,  led to the arrest of 31 people across 11 states , including members of the American-Sicilian mafia operation La Cosa Nostra.\n\nPart of what makes the case feel so cinematic is the alleged involvement of the mob. Thanks to decades of film, television, and books dedicated to tales of mafia exploits, the mafia has developed a mythical place in American culture.\n\n\"As Ray Liotta said in Goodfellas: 'We were treated like movie stars with muscle',\" said attorney Ed McDonald, who, as the real-life prosecutor who managed former mobster-turned-FBI informant Henry Hill, played himself in the iconic film.\n\nBut former prosecutors said the mafia's influence and activities have changed since its heyday in the 20th century, when blood-soaked tabloid covers bearing news of mafia hits, business shakedowns, and blockbuster trials were the norm.\n\nAggressive prosecutions in the 1980s and 1990s helped break the power of the mafia in New York and took down several prominent leaders.\n\n\"The bottom line is, the mafia ain't what it used to be,\" Mr McDonald said.\n\nIn fact, it has evolved. And the poker-fixing investigation announced by the FBI on Thursday provides a fair representation of what those activities look like in the 2020s, former prosecutors say.\n\n\"These families continued to exist and shifted to rackets that were a lot more profitable and had a lot fewer downside risks to them, in terms of years of prison they might face,\" said Drew Rolle, the former acting chief of the organised crimes and gangs section at the Eastern District of New York.\n\nThe mafia now involves itself in securities fraud, gambling, online sports betting, and so called \"boiler-room\" operations that involve elaborate telephone scams, he added.\n\nIn 2022, federal authorities in the Eastern District indicted nine members of the Genovese and Bonnano crime families on charges of racketeering, illegal gambling, money laundering, and other crimes.\n\nIn December 2024, former Genovese crime family captain Carmelo Polito was sentenced to 30 months in prison for running an illicit gambling parlour and illegal online gambling scheme.\n\nThursday's indictment added yet another example to the pile.\n\nFederal law enforcement laid out an elaborate scheme in which the defendants \"used sophisticated technology and enlisted current and former NBA players to cheat people out of millions of dollars\".\n\nThree of the so-called Five Families – the Gambinos, Bonnanos, and Genoveses – were allegedly involved.\n\n\"When people refused to pay because they were cheated, these defendants did what organised crime has always done: they used threats, intimidation, and violence,\" New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.\n\nBeginning as early as 2019, the criminal enterprises set up illegal poker games that utilised a range of cheating technologies, the indictment states. The defendants used a compromised shuffling machines to rig the decks, and a \"chip tray analyser\" that secretly reads cards using hidden cameras.\n\nIn a detail more reminiscent of Mission Impossible than Miller's Crossing, players are accused of wearing special contact lenses or eyeglasses that helped them see pre-marked cards.\n\nFormer professional NBA athletes were enlisted as so called \"Face Cards\" to entice unsuspecting players to join the game, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe illegally obtained information was transmitted back to an off-site participant who then sent details back to a co-conspirator sitting at the poker table, prosecutors allege. The players participating on the scheme would signal each other as the game progressed.\n\nNBA announced it had placed Mr Billups on \"immediate leave\" from his coaching position with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n\"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,\" it said.\n\nFederal authorities also arrested NBA player Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat over charges in a related case. His lawyer, James Trusty, denied the allegations and said his client \"is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight\".\n\nThe case remains in its earliest stages, but the combination of professional basketball intrigue and an alleged backroom mafia racket will likely ensure the case remains in the public eye for months, or years, to come.\n\n\"The things [the mafia] is focused on might have changed and not be as headline-grabbing and violent,\" said Mr Rolle, now a partner at the firm Alston & Bird.\n\n\"But in terms of their ability to affect industries in the city, there are some that still face down organised crime elements of their businesses, and it continues to be a challenge for people in this city.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1rrzn1kwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:16:22.355+00:00","title":"Soft Cell's musical force Dave Ball dies, aged 66","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dave Ball, the keyboardist and co-founder of the influential synth-pop duo Soft Cell, has died at the age of 66.

1981, an unlikely group from Leeds scored a number one hit with their icy cover version of an obscure 60s soul hit.\n\nWith Tainted Love, Soft Cell set a template for 80s synth-pop duos: The flamboyant frontman paired with an unassuming keyboard technician.\n\nDave Ball, who has died at the age of 66, was that musical force, creating ominous, polyphonic soundscapes to match Marc Almond's lyrics about X-rated movies and sado-masochism.\n\nTainted Love sold more than 21 million copies across the world and was followed by hits such as Say Hello, Wave Goodbye and Torch, before the band split in 1984. Reunited in the 2000s, they had completed a new album in the days before Ball's death.\n\nIn a statement, the musician's family said he had died peacefully in his sleep at his home in London on Wednesday 22 October.\n\nIt comes less than two months after Soft Cell played a headline show to 20,000 fans at the Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames.\n\nDuring that concert, Ball performed in a wheelchair, as he had for the last two years, following a spate of ill-health.\n\n\"I managed to damage myself quite a bit,\"  he told the Yorkshire Post in 2023 . \"I fractured lower vertebrae in my spine and cracked about five ribs and broke my wrist\".\n\nAfter catching pneumonia and developing sepsis, he was placed in an induced coma and remained in hospital for seven months.\n\nHowever, he had been in \"a great place emotionally\" over the summer, as he worked on Soft Cell's new album, Danceteria, which is scheduled for release next year.\n\n\"He was focused and so happy with the new album that we literally completed only a few days ago,\" said Almond in a tribute.\n\n\"It's so sad as 2026 was all set to be such an uplifting year for him, and I take some solace from the fact that he heard the finished record and felt that it was a great piece of work.\"\n\nAlmond has thanked his bandmate for \"being an immense part of my life and for the music you gave me\", adding: \"I wouldn't be where I am without you.\"\n\nBall had also been part of the pioneering techno duo The Grid, who scored a UK top 10 hit in 1994 with the banjo-powered Swamp Thing.\n\nHis bandmate from that era, Richard Norris, also paid tribute, remembering Ball's \"endless laughter\" and \"unwavering friendship\".\n\n\"Being in a duo with someone is different from being in a band, the bond is very tight,\" he added.\n\n\"That's how it was with us. We went through so many remarkable, extraordinary, life-affirming experiences together. Thank you, Dave.\"\n\nBorn into a single-parent household in Chester in 1959, Ball was placed for adoption when he was 18 months old.\n\nHe grew up in Blackpool with adoptive parents Donald and Brenda Ball, who changed his first name from Paul to David, alongside his younger sister Susan, who was also adopted.\n\nHe met Almond at Leeds Polytechnic in 1977, where they were both studying art. Fuelled by a shared love of Northern Soul, they formed Soft Cell the same year, and quickly recorded an EP, which was given early airtime by Radio 1's John Peel.\n\nThey were an unusual pairing: Ball was quietly hunched over his keyboard, while Almond was a flamboyant showman, all glitter and eye-liner; but they achieved a rare musical alchemy.\n\nBall had developed a fascination with synthesizers after watching Kraftwerk appear on BBC science show Tomorrow's World, and began to marry dark electronica to the soaring melodies Almond was writing.\n\nTainted Love became the UK's second biggest-selling single of 1981, shifting 21 million copies worldwide. Alongside hits by Gary Numan, Human League and Ultravox, it helped paved the way for the synth-pop sound of the 80s.\n\nThe song was also included on their full-length debut, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, which spawned two further top five singles: Bedsitter and Say Hello, Wave Goodbye.\n\nThey followed the album with the stand-alone single, Torch, which peaked at number two in 1982.\n\nFame had its upsides. \"I loved being able to afford my first home, having money and travelling, which makes me sound like a Miss World,\" Ball recently told Classic Pop Magazine.\n\nBut it also presented problems. \"Newfound wealth meant we could afford newfound drugs to relieve the boredom\" of media interviews and TV performances, Ball said.\n\n\"I know that's a cliché, but it's a cliché for a good reason, because it works for so many bands.\"\n\nAmidst the hedonistic lifestyle, the duo were also drifting apart, but they managed to create a second classic album - the wayward, tense and aptly-titled The Art Of Falling Apart.\n\nThey released one more album, 1984's This Last Night In Sodom, before dissolving the band to concentrate on other projects.\n\nAlmond went on to have a successful solo career, including the top 10 hit Something's Got A Hold Of My Heart; while Ball created The Grid, who mixed acid house with ambient pop over a long-lasting collaboration.\n\nSoft Cell reunited in 2001, producing the Top 40 album Cruelty Without Beauty.\n\nAfter another hiatus, they reappeared in 2018, releasing the original singles Northern Lights and Guilty (Cos I Say You Are) before performing what was supposed to be a farewell show at the O2 Arena on 30 September, 2018.\n\nHowever, they remained together, recording their fifth album, Happiness Not Included, during the 2020 Covid lockdown.\n\nBall recently described the band's new music as a tribute to the New York club scene they frequented while recording their first two albums.\n\nHe added that his time in hospital had influenced the band's sound.\n\n\"I had strange recollections when I was in and out of hospital because I was on morphine,\" he told Classic Pop.\n\n\"The new songs are a digital reflection of the sounds in my head from that time.\n\n\"In parallel, it's about the times me and Marc got up to in the 80s.\"\n\nThe final mixes were completed only days before Ball died. It is due for release in Spring 2026."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/podcasts/the-headlines/crypto-pardon-nba-gambling-scandal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:00:06-04:00","title":"A Major Crypto Pardon, and the N.B.A. Gambling Scandal With Mob Ties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of significant political and regulatory developments: the San Francisco Mayor’s strategic response to a potential enforcement surge from the Trump administration, Trump’s pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, the suspension of U.S.-Canada trade negotiations, the Democratic opposition to a federal worker pay bill deepening the government shutdown, and a growing narrative suggesting that a sports betting scandal involving organized crime ties was inevitable.

of President Trump, both said this week that the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip did not necessarily have to wait until Hamas was disarmed or no longer a threat in the territory.\n\nA cease-fire that came into effect earlier this month divides Gaza along the so-called yellow line — between the eastern, inland half under the control of the Israeli military and the Hamas-controlled part of the enclave. Reconstruction could begin very soon in the Israeli-controlled part, the two Americans, who were on visits to Israel, told reporters.\n\n“No reconstruction funds will be going into areas that Hamas still controls,” Mr. Kushner said on Tuesday. But he spoke of building “a new Gaza” on the Israeli-held side.\n\nThe idea has great appeal to Israel’s supporters: a chance to create a model Palestinian community with no rockets or tunnels that could threaten Israel.\n\nThe approach is reminiscent of the improbable “Riviera of the Middle East” plan that Mr. Trump once imagined for a Gaza depopulated of Palestinians.\n\nKeeping Hamas operatives out of a rebuilt swath of Gaza could entail such heavy-handed security that it may look like another military occupation, experts said.\n\nA key question here is whether such a reconstruction effort could truly take root in a way that points toward a more durable peace or would be seen as merely a back door to another Israeli military occupation. Arab countries will also be wary of being involved in a plan that could be seen as aiding an occupation.\n\nMost of Gaza’s two million people have been displaced repeatedly in two years of war. For many, the offer of a fresh start in a community built from scratch cannot overcome their attachment to a specific patch of Gaza land.\n\n“Too many people talk about us like we’re chess pieces,” said Mohammed Fares, 25, who is living in Deir al Balah after his family home in Gaza City was destroyed. “They think we can just be moved from one space to another.”\n\nUnder the cease-fire, the Israeli military pulled back to an area totaling 53 percent of the Gaza Strip, roughly its eastern half. Palestinians have been warned to stay out of that side of Gaza; some who have ignored those warnings or been confused by the boundary have been killed. The Israelis have begun marking the territory with yellow-painted concrete blocks.\n\nThe Israeli military said that when the cease-fire went into effect, there were about 30,000 Palestinians in areas of Rafah and Khan Younis, in southern Gaza — areas where the Israeli military is in control. The military said it is allowing those Palestinians to leave and enter Hamas-controlled areas, but not to return back to the Israeli-controlled areas.\n\nOtherwise, officials say, much of the area under the control of Israel is now a wasteland where the only people for miles in any direction are soldiers.\n\nMr. Vance voiced strong support for the idea during his visit to Israel.\n\n“This is all still pretty early, but that’s the basic idea,” Mr. Vance said on Thursday. “Take the areas where Hamas is not operating, start to rebuild very quickly, start to bring in the Gazans so they can live there, so they can have good jobs and hopefully some security and comfort, too.”\n\nA proposal for reconstruction of areas Hamas no longer controls has broad political appeal among supporters of Israel, including some who have criticized its conduct of the war. Michael Koplow, of the liberal Israel Policy Forum, said it amounted to a welcome do-over opportunity.\n\n“Had Israel treated the areas that the I.D.F. cleared out over the course of the war as opportunity zones to create a functional day after, it would have prevented Hamas from re-establishing itself in those places once the I.D.F. left — which is why the I.D.F. kept on entering the same neighborhoods three or even four times,” Mr. Koplow wrote in a newsletter on Thursday, referring to the Israeli military by its initials.\n\nTamir Hayman, a former chief of Israeli military intelligence, said that it was one thing to rebuild east of the yellow line and another to allow Palestinians to move back in while keeping Hamas out.\n\n“You will need to screen, 24/7, every bad-entity individual that passes through,” he said. “You’ll need outposts and checkpoints. And if you call it a new form of occupation of Gaza, you might be right. And I think Hamas will try to disrupt it. It will try to infiltrate, to create attacks inside this new area, as a resistance to the occupation.”\n\nThe American government seems to be misunderstanding Gaza’s geography, said Ayed Abu Ramadan, chairman of the Gaza Governorate Chamber of Commerce. “Israel is mostly occupying agricultural and industrial lands,” he said. “So they’re going to build residential structures there? That isn’t logical.”\n\nHe interpreted Mr. Kushner’s remarks more as a threat to Hamas than as a proposal that can be carried out. “They’re trying to tell Hamas that it needs to work with Trump’s plan,” he said.\n\nTaking the idea seriously, Mr. Abu Ramadan raised concerns about who would be allowed to live in the new Gaza neighborhoods and why.\n\n“They’ll end up separating families,” he said. “They’ll say certain people can’t go because there are question marks about them. They’ll be denied entry because they called the wrong person one time to offer condolences, they shook the wrong person’s hand in the street or their cousin is the wrong person.”\n\nMr. Fares, the displaced Gazan, said he was trying to repair his home in Gaza City that was damaged during the war and did not want to move elsewhere.\n\n“I don’t see any benefit to this program,” he said. “We want to rebuild our homes in Gaza City. My roots are there.”\n\nAdam Rasgon and Natan Odenheimer contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/letitia-james-court.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:04:10-04:00","title":"Letitia James to Appear in Court as Battle Over Trump-Urged Prosecution Begins","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Letitia James, New York’s Attorney General, is set to appear in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, for an arraignment on charges of bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution, stemming from allegations she misrepresented the use of a Virginia home as a rental property.

How her case, which was pursued at President Trump’s demand over the objections of career prosecutors, plays out could hold signals for the president’s wider efforts to seek retribution against his perceived enemies.\n\nMs. James has said the charges against her — one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution — are “baseless.” Her indictment, she has said, is “nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system.”\n\nMs. James stands accused of lying about her purpose in buying a house in Virginia in 2020. Prosecutors say that while she said the house would be a secondary residence, she in fact used it as a “rental investment property,” renting it to a family of three.\n\nBut Ms. James’s great-niece has lived in the house since 2020, and testified to a Norfolk grand jury that she does not pay rent. Ms. James has reported only $1,350 in rent from the property on her tax forms.\n\nCareer prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia who had reviewed the evidence had concluded it did not support criminal charges, but the president abruptly forced out the U.S. attorney who had been overseeing the office and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who had no prosecutorial experience.\n\nSoon after her appointment, Ms. Halligan secured a grand jury indictment against Ms. James and, in an unrelated case, false statement and obstruction charges against James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director. Mr. Trump had publicly implored Justice Department officials to charge Ms. James and Mr. Comey with crimes, calling them “guilty as hell.” Both have been longtime antagonists of the president, and Ms. James had won a civil case for business fraud against him in New York.\n\nArraignments are generally brief proceedings for the defendant to enter a formal plea. But the day will also mark the beginning of Mr. Lowell’s efforts to persuade the judge to dismiss the case before it can go to trial.\n\nOn the eve of her court appearance, lawyers for Ms. James told the court that they intend to challenge the legality of Ms. Halligan’s appointment, as was already done by Mr. Comey’s legal team. The filing by Ms. James’s lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, suggests both those efforts could be joined into a single case for a judge to hear.\n\nSeparately, Ms. James’s lawyer also asked the judge overseeing her case to warn Ms. Halligan about making any extrajudicial comments about the case. Earlier this month, Ms. Halligan sent a series of argumentative texts to a reporter at Lawfare, a national security website. In the texts, Ms. Halligan pushed back against some descriptions of the evidence, arguing that her case is stronger than some of the reporting would suggest.\n\n“These extrajudicial statements and prejudicial disclosures by any prosecutor, let alone one purporting to be the U.S. attorney, run afoul of and violate the federal rules of criminal procedure, the code of federal regulations, this court’s local rules, various rules of ethical and professional responsibility and D.O.J.’s justice manual,” Mr. Lowell wrote.\n\nHe urged the judge to intervene “to prevent any further disclosures by government attorneys and agents of investigative and case materials, and statements to the media and public.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6nd9wnzn6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"11:18:44.327+00:00","title":"'Mind-boggling' poker fraud used X-ray tables, high-tech glasses and NBA players","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sprawling federal investigation uncovered an elaborate poker fraud scheme that began as early as 2019, allegedly operated by members of major mafia crime families such as Bonnano, Gambino, Lucchese, and Genovese.

hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.\n\nBut they didn't know it was nearly impossible. They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand.\n\nIn what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25m) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.\n\nThe scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Cosa Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones.\n\nFBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities.\n\nArrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds.\n\nThe underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise.\n\nFormer professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing.\n\nLured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege.\n\nUnbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment.\n\nSophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.\n\nThe technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands.\n\nSecretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say.\n\nThen there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege.\n\nInformation from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\".\n\nThat person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win.\n\nTexts from the US justice department's evidence suggest the \"quarterback\" would either touch the $1,000 poker chip, tap his chin, wrist or arm to signal which conspirator had the best hand.\n\nIf the victim had the best hand, the \"quarterback\" would touch his black chips.\n\nThe texts also appear to show that at times conspirators agreed to lose some hands in order to keep victims at the gambling table for longer.\n\nAnother series of texts suggests participants in the scheme avoided suspicion of cheating by swapping in players and losing money to co-conspirators.\n\nAuthorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nProsecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies.\n\nA cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise.\n\n\"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.\n\nBillups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were \"fully co-operating with the investigation\".\n\nJones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme.

But Not for Long.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T05:03:24-04:00\n\nSince the Trump administration started imposing steep tariffs on goods from the rest of the world, the Treasury Department has been taking in about $30 billion a month in customs duties. On paper, American companies pay those bills when their products enter the country.\n\nBut figuring who ultimately absorbs the costs is more complicated. Inflation data, which will be updated on Friday after being delayed by the government shutdown, has thus far shown limited effects for consumers. Corporate earnings calls in recent weeks suggest that is changing.\n\nCompanies had passed along about 37 percent of new tariffs to consumers, forced 9 percent onto their suppliers and absorbed 51 percent through August, according to Goldman Sachs. That is a big hit to shoppers’ wallets, enough to reverse inflation’s fall. But it’s milder than it would have been if companies were charging as much to consumers as they had at the same point in the last burst of tariffs during President Trump’s first term.\n\nMostly that’s because the tariffs are much higher and more widespread than in 2018, making them too difficult for consumers to digest all at once. Corporate profit margins are also healthier, consumers are more exhausted by price increases over the past several years — and companies suspect the White House may back down on tariffs eventually.\n\nMichael McAdoo, a partner at the consulting firm BCG’s global trade and investment group, said many of his clients had swallowed the tariffs at first while waiting for the landscape to stabilize. But now, he said, “some are trying to squeeze the foreign supplier, and some are trying to improve their own operations, and some are using pricing.”\n\nAs new duties have kicked in, American-made products have gotten pricier too.\n\nSource: Harvard Pricing Lab analysis of prices from four large retailers.\n\nBy The New York Times.\n\nThroughout corporate America this earnings season, a theme emerges: Companies want to keep prices low. But they know investors won’t accept narrower profit margins for long, so they have to figure out how to make up for tariff costs.\n\nNike told investors last month that it expected to pay $1.5 billion in tariff costs in its current fiscal year, and the toymaker Mattel estimated its tariff costs at $100 million. Raytheon, a defense manufacturer, said it had paid $220 million in tariff costs in the third quarter, and 3M, the medical and consumer products manufacturer, spent $100 million on tariffs and related costs. The oil industry contractor Halliburton forecast $60 million in tariff costs for the fourth quarter.\n\nIt’s not always clear how much of those expenses companies may recoup in other ways. Some companies say they’ve fully offset the costs: Autoliv, which supplies parts to carmakers, said it had recovered about 75 percent of its tariff costs and expected to make up for all of them by the end of the year.\n\nAutoliv’s customers, however, are not fully factoring those extra costs into the sticker price on dealer lots. General Motors said it anticipated paying between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in tariffs this year, and has raised prices by less than 1 percent. Much of the rest is pulling from its bottom line: The automaker said tariffs had squeezed its margins in North America from 9 percent to 6.2 percent in the third quarter.\n\nThat reluctance to ask car buyers to pay more reflects a hope that the tariffs will be temporary — the industry is lobbying the Trump administration to lift them — and competition from domestic producers. New vehicle prices have fallen slightly since their peak in 2023, inflation data through August showed.\n\n“Automakers have generally held steady on price hikes because they’re holding out for tariff relief,” said Andrew Schneider, a senior economist with BNP Paribas. “Automakers that aren’t as exposed to tariffs have tried to take share, and lower prices a bit, and put the pressure on others.”\n\nSome companies are benefiting as tariffs make imports more expensive. The steel maker Cleveland-Cliffs said its third-quarter results were “a clear indication that a significant rebound in domestic steel demand has started.” The company’s orders from automakers jumped after aluminum and steel tariffs took effect in March. That higher-grade steel costs more, driving up margins.\n\nA similar story is playing out across the economy. Domestic prices have climbed only slightly behind prices for imported goods, according to data from the Harvard Pricing Lab, as U.S. manufacturers have become more competitive and padded their margins.\n\nSome companies are both winning and losing because of tariffs. Paccar, the maker of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, said it had taken a $75 million hit in the third quarter from steel and aluminum tariffs, which it only partly recovered through surcharges to customers. But with a new 25 percent tariff on completed trucks set to take effect on Nov. 1, the company expects more orders next quarter.\n\nEven companies that have held off on price increases are signaling that they intend to institute them down the road — especially as ever more tariffs are imposed. In sectors that rely heavily on imports, passing through those tariff costs could be easier because consumers have fewer domestic options.\n\nPrices have already risen particularly swiftly in categories like home furnishings and recreational goods because so many of those products come from China. New furniture tariffs will force costs even higher. The furniture maker Flexsteel declined to provide guidance for the next quarter because the tariff outlook was so uncertain.\n\n“We anticipate the tariff change to result in broad price increases for furniture in the U.S., dampen consumer demand and compressed industry margins in the short term for suppliers, manufacturers and retailers,” Derek Schmidt, Flexsteel’s chief executive, told investors.\n\nBanks are noticing, too. Timothy Spence, the chief executive of Fifth Third Bank, estimated that suppliers, importers and customers were each absorbing a third of tariff costs.\n\n“But the supplier and the intermediaries have also been clear whenever we talk to them that their intent is ultimately to get back to prior margins,” Mr. Spence said on the bank’s earnings call last week. “Which would mean over time, you would see continued price increases as a mechanism to move the cost through.”\n\nTariffs passed through to consumers gradually could keep inflation elevated for a longer period.\n\nPublic companies have more leverage to ask their suppliers for concessions and find other cost savings across their supply chains.\n\n“When you think about the largest businesses, they’re not bearing the full burden of the cost on their own earnings,” said Stephen Juneau, a U.S. economist with Bank of America. “They’re able to exert their own purchasing power on their suppliers and push down and share the burden of the tariffs across their supply chain.”\n\nSmaller businesses have fewer options. Richard Rosenfeld, owner of Two Leaves and a Bud, a Colorado-based tea company, was preparing a big expansion as matcha grew in popularity. Then he hit a wall of tariffs — virtually no tea is grown in the United States, so the only options are imported.\n\nHe held off on price increases for a while, working through inventory and holding off on hiring more people, waiting to assess the consequences.\n\n“There’s a lot of elasticity in the system,” Mr. Rosenfeld said. But the rubber band has stretched as far as it can go, and he recently imposed the largest price increase in his company’s history.\n\n“We’ll have another price increase absolutely coming soon,” he said. “And I can’t imagine that we won’t have multiple rounds of price increases next year as all these tariffs affect not only us but all the suppliers who supply us and supply our suppliers.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/world/europe/russia-oil-sanctions-prices.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"17:44:54-04:00","title":"The U.S. and Europe Are Trying New Ways to Pressure Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, the United States and European Union imposed new economic sanctions on Russia’s largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, and committed to banning all purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas by 2027.

Ukraine\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T06:47:25-04:00\n\nEurope is mustering another show of support for Ukraine as Britain convenes a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” on Friday to discuss a boycott of Russian oil and gas, a loan to Ukraine using Russian sovereign assets, and accelerated weapon shipments to reinforce Kyiv’s military campaign against Russia.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and the leaders of Denmark, the Netherlands and NATO arrived in London for the meeting, which is being led by Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer. Twenty other leaders are joining the session by videoconference, according to 10 Downing Street.\n\nFor the moment, Europe has the wind at its back. President Trump’s decision to impose sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, was followed by the European Union’s own latest round of sanctions. The European Union also pledged to continue funding Ukraine’s financial and military needs, while Britain announced that it would speed the delivery of an extra 100 air-defense missiles.\n\n“From the battlefield to the global markets, as Putin continues to commit atrocities in Ukraine, we must ratchet up the pressure on Russia and build on President Trump’s decisive action,” Mr. Starmer said in a statement before the meeting. He and Mr. Zelensky are expected to speak to reporters on Friday afternoon.\n\n“After all, Ukraine’s security matters to us all, and what happens on the front line of Donetsk today is shaping our collective future for years to come,” Mr. Starmer declared in his statement, referring to a region of eastern Ukraine that is the primary focus of Russia’s territorial ambitions.\n\nThe British hosts are framing this meeting as an effort to fortify Ukraine for the winter fighting months. Under a deal worth 1.6 billion pounds ($2.13 billion) announced in March, Britain agreed to supply more than 5,000 lightweight missiles to defend Ukraine from Russian attacks. Production has ramped up faster than expected, Downing Street said, putting it in a position to deliver an additional 140 missiles in time for Ukraine to use them during winter.\n\nBritain and France jointly lead the so-called coalition of the willing, which Mr. Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron started in March. Its prospects have waxed and waned, in part because of Mr. Trump’s erratic views — he pivots between pressuring Mr. Zelensky and criticizing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — and in part because of Europe’s own fitful struggle for unity.\n\nWhile the European Union followed the Trump administration in imposing energy sanctions on Russia, European leaders were unable to agree this week on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to finance a huge loan to Ukraine. Belgium, which holds the bulk of the assets, voiced concerns about legal liability.\n\nMr. Starmer said he planned to pressure his fellow leaders to move ahead with the loan plan, though Britain, having left the European Union in 2020, no longer exerts much influence on negotiations in Brussels.\n\nBefore joining Mr. Starmer at the British Foreign Office, Mr. Zelensky met with King Charles III at Windsor Castle, west of London. The king has met the president three times this year in what is viewed as a symbolic show of British solidarity.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/business/economy/us-china-trade-investigation.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:07:48-04:00","title":"U.S. to Begin Investigation Into China’s Compliance With 2020 Trade Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is preparing to launch a trade investigation into China’s failure to fulfill its 2020 trade deal commitments, particularly the pledge to buy an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods and services.

Betting Scandal Inevitable?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T05:03:42-04:00\n\nThe signs that gambling has become embedded in American sports culture are impossible to miss. Sportsbooks have set up shop at stadiums, televised games include prods to bet during the action and star athletes like LeBron James promote gambling companies as “talent ambassadors.”\n\nIn the seven years since a Supreme Court decision cleared the way for legalized sports betting, the major U.S. sports leagues have shed any hesitations they had about gambling. They are now profiting — to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year — from partnerships with sports betting companies.\n\nTeam owners have made the calculation that the financial upside is worth “the potential expected likely loss if some form of scandal were to come up,” said Marc Edelman, a law professor and director of sports ethics at Baruch College in New York. “But who’s to say whether or not that’s a rational conclusion?”\n\nThat is the question that American sports leagues are now reckoning with after federal authorities on Thursday revealed details in a wide-ranging criminal sports betting investigation nicknamed “Nothing but Bet.”\n\nFederal authorities charged six people — including Terry Rozier, a current N.B.A. player, and Damon Jones, a former N.B.A. player and coach — with participating in a scheme that they said used inside information to set up hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent sports bets. Another N.B.A. player, Jontay Porter, previously pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy as part of what officials said was the same gambling scheme and has been permanently banned by the league.\n\n“We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,” the National Basketball Association said in a statement. A second criminal investigation into rigged poker games, in which the Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Jones were among dozens of people charged, was also announced Thursday.\n\nThe impact of the sports betting case remains to be seen and could be minimal. The volume of fraudulent wagers described in the indictment is a small fraction of the multibillion-dollar sports betting industry, and the N.B.A.’s immense popularity could insulate it from the impact of what is, to this point, a relatively isolated scandal.\n\nStill, the fraudulent-betting case challenges the very thing that makes sports magical and pulls in millions of live viewers even in an on-demand era: the belief that anything can happen. Among the examples detailed in the indictment: Authorities said Rozier, while playing for the Charlotte Hornets in 2023, had told associates that he would “prematurely” remove himself from a game. His associates then placed bets on his underperforming the oddsmakers’ lines on his individual performance.\n\nThe indictment also listed other examples between 2022 and 2024 in which, authorities said, inside information about a team’s lineup — including one case that appeared to involve the availability of LeBron James to play — was used to make fraudulent bets. (James has not been accused of any wrongdoing.)\n\nA spokesman for FanDuel, the largest sports betting operator in the United States, called the indictments “deeply disturbing,” adding that they should “concern fans, athletes and everyone who loves sports and values integrity and fair play.” Both FanDuel and DraftKings, the nation’s second-largest sportsbook, said that they used technology to detect and report suspicious betting activity, and that they would continue to work with sports leagues to make sure play was not rigged. Authorities said the sportsbooks that took the bets, which were not named in the indictment, were victims of the fraud.\n\nSports betting companies like FanDuel and DraftKings often say legal, regulated gambling is much better than the alternative of disreputable illegal gambling. The indictment puts that assertion to the test: Did legal sports betting allow cheaters to be caught, or did it create the conditions for the cheating in the first place? Or maybe both?\n\nLike the other sports leagues, the N.B.A. works with a sports betting integrity firm. The league said the firm first flagged unusual betting activity on Rozier in 2023. A similar process also identified suspicious betting activity on individual pitches in Major League Baseball games this year, leading to an ongoing league investigation into two Cleveland Guardians pitchers.\n\nThese examples suggest that the system has worked to catch at least some potentially fraudulent betting activity, though experts note that there is no way to know if — or how many — other instances have not been caught.\n\nBut major sportsbooks, aided by leagues and broadcasters, have also aggressively promoted the type of bet that was supposedly rigged in this case. Proposition, or prop, bets are placed on individual events or player performances that are not necessarily tied to a game’s outcome, making them more susceptible to manipulation.\n\nSome sports leaders, including Charlie Baker, the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and Adam Silver, commissioner of the N.B.A., have expressed concerns about prop bets, citing the risks to game integrity and player harassment. At the same time, sports betting operators have pushed to create more chances to bet throughout games, including what are known as microbets, on events that are resolved in a matter of seconds, like a single pitch or basket.\n\nGame integrity affects every stakeholder in the vast business ecosystem created around sports betting, including sportsbooks, sports leagues and bettors. But it is especially urgent for the sports leagues, because they are responsible for putting on games that the public can trust are fair and are a cultural force that has helped shape attitudes toward betting.\n\n“The leagues have to look themselves in the eye,” said Mark Conrad, professor of law and ethics at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. “They’ve gone to bed with the big gambling companies, seeing the monetary advantage. This is the downside of it.”\n\nGuarding against this downside was what Bill Bradley, the former New York Knicks player and U.S. senator, had in mind in 1992 when he sponsored the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. That law prohibited sports betting nationwide outside of a few states that had exceptions. Reached on Thursday, Bradley recalled thinking that the law’s passage had insulated sports from reliving scandals like the infamous Chicago White Sox game-fixing in the 1919 World Series.\n\nHis confidence was premature. The Supreme Court overturned that federal law a quarter-century later. Today, 39 states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports gambling.\n\n“It was a bill that essentially recognized the role sports plays in individual people’s lives, and in communities’ lives, and how that role is important to preserve,” Bradley said in a phone interview. “And it cannot be preserved once the integrity of the game itself is compromised by betting — like this.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/arts/television/ken-burns-american-revolution.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:01:36-04:00","title":"Can Ken Burns Win the American Revolution?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ken Burns, the renowned documentary filmmaker, has released a six-part, 12-hour film titled 'The American Revolution' on PBS, premiering on November 16, 2025. The film, which cost over $30 million and draws on more than 18,000 archival images and documents, presents a nuanced, complex, and inclusive account of the Revolution — one that acknowledges slavery, Native American dispossession, and the deep divisions within colonial society. Unlike traditional narratives that romanticize the Revolution as a unified struggle for freedom, this film features diverse first-person testimonies, re-enactors, and historical analysis to show how different groups — including African Americans, women, and Native nations — experienced the conflict. The film’s release occurs during a period of intense political polarization, as President Donald Trump and his allies push a simplified, patriotic narrative of history, leading to backlash against PBS and the removal of 'divisive' content from public institutions.

Ken Burns was back on the battlefield.\n\nHe had just driven two hours from his home in New Hampshire to a rolling meadow outside Saratoga Springs, where the view has changed little since the Continental Army scored its first major victory over the British in 1777. After climbing onto the porch of an 18th-century farmhouse, he started delivering his now-familiar spiel to a small group of journalists and local officials.\n\n“The American Revolution is encrusted with the barnacles of sentimentality and nostalgia,” he said. But his six-part, 12-hour documentary about the subject, which debuts on PBS on Nov. 16, will aim to strip that away — and hopefully bring some healing to our own fractured moment.\n\n“We say, ‘Oh we’re so divided,’ as if we’re Chicken Little and this is the worst it’s ever been,” he said. “But the Revolution was a pretty divided time. The Civil War was a pretty divided time. Almost all of American history is division.”\n\nMaybe storytelling, he said, can “help short-circuit the binaries we have today.”\n\nThe remarks were pure Burns — the kind of sunny all-American optimism that thrills his admirers, and draws eye-rolls among skeptics. But “The American Revolution,” which Burns directed with Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, is arriving at a moment when even attempting to bring a unifying story to a broad American middle feels like a radical act.\n\nSince returning to office, President Trump has renewed his call for a return to celebratory “patriotic” history, blasting away at those he accuses of slandering the past. He’s moved to purge the Smithsonian of what he deems “divisive race-based ideology,” and ordered material that “disparages Americans” to be removed from National Park sites. In July, his Republican allies in Congress eliminated federal funding altogether for PBS, Burns’s longtime broadcast home.\n\n“The American Revolution,” with its frank discussions of slavery and Native American dispossession, certainly cuts against the Trumpist view of history. But in a six-month, 32-city promotional tour across red, blue and purple America, Burns has been sticking relentlessly to a hopeful, nonpartisan, nonconfrontational script.\n\nWhether at sold-out events organized by PBS affiliates or on bro-friendly podcasts like Joe Rogan and Theo Von, he has talked again and again (and again) about “putting the us back in U.S.,” and hailed the Revolution as “the most significant event in human history since the birth of Christ.”\n\nAt every stop, he has talked about the preciousness of democracy and defended PBS, where he is as synonymous as Big Bird. But he has rarely uttered the words “Donald Trump.”\n\nIn an interview last month in New York City, Burns acknowledged the charged moment. But when it comes to the film, he insisted, his responsibility is the same as it has always been: to tell the story of the past straight, to as many Americans as possible.\n\n“I just really hope the film has an ability to speak to the people who are concerned about the direction of the country, whoever that might be,” he said. “This spectacularly inspiring story of our founding, as dark and complex as it is, has — I think, I hope — the ability to add something to the conversation right now that is unifying.”\n\nBurns started working on the film in December 2015, while finishing up his documentary on the Vietnam War. Barack Obama had 13 months left in the White House, and enthusiasm for the upbeat, inclusive vision of the founding in the musical “Hamilton” was at its peak.\n\nThe filmmakers’ main concern wasn’t politics or historiography, but something more basic: How do you make a compelling documentary with no photographs, no newsreels, no living witnesses and a visual record that reads to many Americans as starchy and boring?\n\n“The American Revolution,” which cost more than $30 million, began with the building of an archive. As the historian Geoffrey C. Ward (who has written 20 of Burns’s documentaries) dove into scholarship on the Revolution, researchers assembled more than 18,000 maps, engravings, paintings and documents, culled from nearly 350 galleries, museums and libraries.\n\nThe film makes ample use of the famous “Ken Burns effect,” with the camera panning across static images. It also uses newer tools, like the CGI maps used in some battle sequences. But the biggest departure was the use of re-enactors.\n\nThe cinematography team, led by Burns’s longtime collaborator Buddy Squires, filmed hundreds of re-enactors and costumed interpreters across the 13 colonies, in all kinds of weather. Shooting overhead with drones and up close on the ground, they captured soldiers and sailors, but also washerwomen, blacksmiths and farmers.\n\n“We wanted to find a way to make people feel real and alive, including those who didn’t leave a lot behind that lets you figure out how to recreate them,” Botstein said.\n\nThe spine of the documentary is the military story, which is highlighted in 36 often suspenseful (and speaker-rattling) battle sequences, from the famous (Bunker Hill, Yorktown) to the more obscure. But its emotional heart is the first-person testimony of nearly 150 historical characters from all segments of society, read by 61 different voice actors.\n\nWe hear plenty from the Founding Fathers. But we also get the words of women, Native Americans, free and enslaved Africans, poor Irish immigrants, German mercenaries — all of whom wrestle with what it means to seek freedom, and often find very different answers.\n\nThat approach is very much in keeping with the latest scholarship, which depicts the Revolution as a hyper-violent civil war that divided families and communities and left many Native Americans and African Americans worse off, and less free. And the film doesn’t demonize loyalists, who were sometimes subjected to horrific retribution.\n\n“They weren’t bad people,” Burns said. “They were just what we would call conservatives.”\n\nThe film notes that while roughly 5,000 Black people, free and enslaved, fought on the patriot side, an estimated 15,000 fought for the British, who promised them freedom (a promise that was largely betrayed).\n\nBut for many viewers, the most eye-opening part of the documentary may be the centrality of Native Americans. They are presented not as victims or bystanders, but as members of powerful nations faced with complex choices about how to defend their own liberty.\n\nIn the prologue, the film’s narrator, Peter Coyote, says the Revolution was sparked by disputes over “Indian land, taxation and representation.” It’s an acknowledgment that the colonists’ desire for unfettered access to Native lands was a primary cause of the break with Britain, which had forbidden any settlement west of the Appalachians.\n\nThat theme is echoed throughout the documentary. One of the most chilling sequences describes the Sullivan campaign of 1779, in upstate New York, where Washington ordered the destruction of all villages, crops and orchards of the Seneca and Cayuga, who had allied with the British. “You will not by any means listen to any overture for peace, before the total ruin of their settlements is effected,” Washington declared.\n\nBut the film is not an exercise in tearing down heroes. In one sequence, two historians — not a profession known for embracing the great-man view of the past — each describe Washington as the essential man of the Revolution, who kept the 13 colonies united through eight years of war.\n\n“He was the glue that held people together,” the historian Annette Gordon-Reed says, adding, “We would not have had a country without him.”\n\nBurns has had a complicated relationship with academic scholars, who have sometimes dismissed his films as sugary and sentimental, too quick to paper over unresolved divisions with appeals to unity. “The Civil War,” in particular, has drawn persistent criticism for what some see as a romanticized depiction of the conflict as a family feud that stemmed mainly from a failure to compromise.\n\nFor “The American Revolution,” the filmmakers drew on two dozen historical consultants, who offered extensive comments on multiple drafts and rough cuts. They include best-selling authors like Joseph Ellis and Stacy Schiff, along with leading academic scholars of three generations and multiple perspectives, from Bernard Bailyn to Ned Blackhawk.\n\nTheir differing views appear onscreen not as an argument, but as a kind of chorus — a reminder that the Revolution meant, and still means, different things to different people.\n\nIt remains to be seen what Burns’s version will mean to viewers, including ideologues who may be ready to pounce. Last January, Burns and Botstein appeared with three historians at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association. When someone brought up the possibility of political attacks, there was a pause, then nervous laughter.\n\n“We’d love your help in getting it out and making sure in the local areas it isn’t excised in a way that just favors one shocking thing,” Burns said.\n\nThat fear remains. But some scholars who worked on the film said they sense a hunger across the political spectrum for a conversation that stands outside today’s partisan polemics.\n\nKathleen DuVal, a historian at the University of North Carolina, calls it “inspiration with content.”\n\n“People want to be reminded why having a republic is important and what people did to get it,” she said.\n\nJane Kamensky, a former Harvard professor who is now the president and chief executive at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello, said the film offers a “head and heart synthesis” that leaves room for viewers to reach their own conclusions.\n\n“The Revolution was the Big Bang of the question of what it means to be one people,” Kamensky said. “That was there in 1776, and it’s there now. But at no point in working with the team did I feel like they were forcing resonances.”\n\nStill, 2025 has relentlessly forced those resonances.\n\nIn March, during an appearance at West Point, Burns received an enthusiastic response from cadets in the grand Gothic dining hall. But a few weeks later, word came that a similar event at the Naval Academy would be postponed, out of concern that Burns’s criticisms of President Trump during the 2024 campaign might draw an outcry from conservatives.\n\nOn July 4, after a swing through Georgia, the Carolinas and Texas, Burns was at Monticello, in Virginia, where he was the speaker at the annual naturalization ceremony. Before the event, in a makeshift green room in Jefferson’s front hall, someone brought up President Trump’s plans, announced the night before, for a UFC mixed-martial arts fight on the White House lawn next summer as part of the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nBurns dropped an un-Jeffersonian expletive. But out on Jefferson’s lawn, where the crowd was dressed mostly in red, white and blue, with a smattering of “I ❤️ PBS” T-shirts, he kept the tone high.\n\nWhatever its messy origins, he said, quoting the film’s prologue, the Revolution came to be about “the noblest aspirations of humankind.”\n\n“That is what this special day, then and now, and every moment in between, and where we will be next July — and onward — is all about,” he said.\n\nStill, the less uplifting historical resonances have continued to pile up. In August, after the president deployed the National Guard in Washington, the first episode of the documentary premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. When the film quoted a colonist protesting the British deployment of troops to an increasingly rebellious Boston, the audience, Burns said, “erupted.”\n\nOn the promotional trail, Burns has been careful to avoid any partisan edge. But during the Saratoga trip, while waiting between events, the author Rick Atkinson, a prominent voice in the film, spoke more pointedly.\n\n“What did the founders fear most? What did they most fear?” He paused. “It wasn’t the British. They most feared the rise to power of an autocrat who did not share the values that the founders tried to embrace.”\n\nSo far, Burns’s insistence on both inspiration and complexity has played well with audiences, including those well outside the PBS orbit.\n\nEarlier this month, on Theo Von’s podcast, he and Von bantered about the nation’s astrological sign (Cancer), and whether it shares the sign’s virtues (emotional, imaginative, loyal) and flaws (moodiness, insecurity, pessimism).\n\nWhen Von suggested the Declaration was “kind of a love letter to the future,” Burns bounced on his seat, eyes widening.\n\n“Oh my God, that’s the best expression I’ve ever heard!” he said, before pivoting to a favorite anecdote about Thomas Paine.\n\nIt was much the same in June when Burns flew to Austin, Texas, to record “The Joe Rogan Experience.” Over nearly three hours, he and Rogan talked about the need for heroes, and for honest accounting of their flaws. For much of the conversation, as Burns ran through his chestnuts, Rogan barely got a word in edgewise beyond “Wow.”\n\nIt’s a reaction Burns loves — proof that the audience for open-minded, fact-based history is still out there.\n\n“That’s a very powerful thing,” he said, “when people let go of their own dialectical or polemical objectives and just say ‘Wow, I had no idea.’”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/world/europe/europe-ukraine-russia.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"03:45:19-04:00","title":"Europe’s Persistence in Supporting Ukraine Is Bearing Fruit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite President Donald Trump’s inconsistent stance, European leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to support Ukraine for at least two years through financial and military aid.

Supporting Ukraine Is Bearing Fruit\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T03:45:19-04:00\n\nNo one can know how long President Trump’s pique with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will last this time. But the past few days have been an important signal that European persistence in its support for Ukraine has paid off, at least for now.\n\nMr. Trump’s decision to impose sanctions on two of Russia’s largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, will have a significant impact on Russian income over time. Europe added its own new sanctions on Thursday and committed to funding Ukraine’s financial and military needs for the next two years.\n\nAn innovative but controversial proposal to use frozen Russian assets as the basis for a large new loan to Ukraine was blocked for now by Belgian concerns about liability. But the bloc will continue to work to find agreement on it. Otherwise meeting the funding pledge made Thursday night would badly strain already indebted national budgets.\n\nEven if the bloc finds the money, questions remain about whether these efforts will be enough to sustain Ukraine’s uneven fight against Russia. And, analysts say, they will do little to persuade Mr. Putin to stop the war in Ukraine or even agree to a rapid cease-fire, as Mr. Trump demands. But the sanctions put substance behind the European commitment to helping Ukraine stand up to Russia — ideally with, or if necessary, without — Mr. Trump at their side.\n\nThe European leaders can also feel some satisfaction that their repeated interventions with Mr. Trump on behalf of Ukraine have finally produced at least some American pressure on Moscow. They insist that they will support Ukraine for as long as required to ensure its survival as an independent state, though any real strategy for ending the war is certain to require serious American pressure on Russia.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s decision to seek no new funding for Ukraine, the Europeans are struggling to find the money to back up their commitment when their own national budgets are badly stretched.\n\nThe loan plan that the bloc is trying to effect would use the billions of dollars of frozen Russian assets in Europe in a complicated legal maneuver that doesn’t seize them outright. The result would be a 140-billion euro loan ($163 billion) to Ukraine, interest free, that would only have to be paid back if Russia pays Ukraine reparations at the end of the war.\n\nBut Belgium, which hosts most of those assets, wants to ensure that it will not be liable and that the bloc shares the risks. Many details remain to be worked out to satisfy the Belgians and, the Europeans hope, to get the participation of other important players in the Group of 7 industrialized nations. A revised version is expected to be on the agenda at the next E.U. summit in December.\n\nStill, the president of the European Council of member states, António Costa, announced confidently late Thursday night that the bloc “is committed to addressing Ukraine’s pressing financial needs for the next two years, including support for its military and defense efforts,” which are estimated to involve more than $150 billion.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the European Union passed another set of sanctions against Russia that hit the energy-dominated Russian economy, as the new American sanctions will do. The bloc advanced a ban on the purchase of Russian liquefied natural gas a year to begin in 2027. It also added another 117 vessels from Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers, which have circumvented earlier controls, to a sanctions list.\n\nThe Europeans also sanctioned Rosneft, but not Lukoil, which supplies cheap oil to Hungary and Slovakia in comparatively small amounts.\n\nEurope has delivered more aid to Ukraine than the United States and has in some ways won the argument that Ukraine must be supported, at least so far, noted Jean-Dominique Giuliani, a French analyst and chairman of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a nonprofit research institution. Europe’s policy requirements had not changed despite Mr. Trump’s vacillation, he said, including an immediate cease-fire, no territorial concessions by Ukraine, reparations and prosecution of war criminals.\n\n“No agreement can be reached at the expense of Ukraine and without the Europeans,” who have imposed numerous sets of sanctions on Russia and hold most of Russia’s assets abroad, Mr. Giuliani wrote on Wednesday.\n\nIn another example of European commitment, the countries of the so-called “coalition of the willing” were meeting on Friday in London to discuss further military support for Kyiv.\n\nStill, the Europeans are working hard to keep Mr. Trump onside, or at least less swayed by Mr. Putin’s blandishments.\n\nMr. Trump tends to change his mind often, alternately voicing frustration with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Mr. Putin and back again. Even as he announced the new sanctions on Wednesday, Mr. Trump expressed the hope that they could be lifted quickly because a broader relationship with Russia has always been part of his foreign-policy ambitions.\n\nTo that end, the national security advisers of the key European nations — Britain, France, Finland, Germany, Italy and others, together with the European Commission — have been working with Ukraine to draft a 12-point plan to end the war. The plan rebrands a number of existing ideas. But it is also designed to show Mr. Trump that Europe is taking responsibility for Ukraine and to attract his interest, being partly modeled on the Gaza cease-fire he has taken credit for.\n\nFor example, the plan includes a “peace board” to be led by Mr. Trump, on the model of the Gaza agreement, to oversee any deal. The board is intended to oversee a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine and the exchange of prisoners and children, an issue that the first lady, Melania Trump, has seized upon. Ukraine would get some form of security guarantees — a topic long discussed by European officials but not fully formed — and more aid and a rapid pathway to membership in the European Union.\n\nRussia would get the gradual lifting of sanctions, but its frozen assets would be used as reparation for Ukraine. So there is little in this plan that is new or that would convince Mr. Putin to stop a war he believes he is winning.\n\nNor will the permission Washington has given Ukraine to once again use longer-range British and French cruise missiles against Russian targets. Because those missiles use American technology and satellite information, Ukraine needed U.S. permission to fire them against Russia. After a long period without it, one such missile was fired on Tuesday against a Russian explosives plant in Bryansk, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nRichard Fontaine of the Center for a New American Security suggested that Mr. Putin’s manipulations and European persistence had helped Mr. Trump to finally impose some pain on Russia.\n\n“Putin will not be moved toward peace by charm, rapport, or skillful deal making,” Mr. Fontaine wrote on social media. “The President may now understand that — and that supporting Ukraine and pressuring Russia is a better path toward ending this terrible war.” He acknowledged that Mr. Trump has a history of reversing himself.\n\nDoubts inevitably persist that Mr. Putin will respond as hoped to the sanctions or even strikes inside Russia. “This is Biden’s strategy redux — this failed for 3 years,” Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis for the nonpartisan security policy think tank Defense Priorities in Washington, wrote on X. “Why would it work now?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/federal-ice-agents-arrests-california-pelosi.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:19:24-04:00","title":"Trump Official Warns California Against Arresting Federal Agents","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant escalation of federal-state tensions, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a legal warning to California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, and to U.S. Rep.

2025-10-24T06:19:24-04:00\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Thursday threatened to prosecute California officials who support arresting federal immigration agents, sharpening the standoff between the Trump administration and local leaders.\n\nMr. Blanche conveyed the warning in a letter a day after several officials in San Francisco, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, and Brooke Jenkins, the city’s district attorney, said that they might seek to arrest federal agents who break California law during immigration raids.\n\nThe suggestion, Ms. Jenkins said, came from seeing agents  confronting people in Los Angeles and Chicago. While she did not envision police officers handcuffing federal agents on city streets, she said she would use video footage to identify agents using excessive force and ask a judge for arrest warrants.\n\nTheir idea would be to prosecute immigration agents who overstep their authority, for example by using excessive force, state officials said. But the ability of states to arrest federal officers is without much legal precedent.\n\nMr. Blanche said in the letter that arresting federal agents performing their duties would violate federal laws against impeding enforcement operations. He posted the letter on social media, addressing it to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, as well as Ms. Pelosi and Ms. Jenkins.\n\nHe also said that the Constitution’s supremacy clause prevents federal officers from being held on a state criminal charge if the alleged crime occurred while the officer was performing federal duties.\n\n“The Department of Justice will investigate and prosecute any state or local official who violates these federal statutes,” he wrote, “or directs or conspires with others to violate them.”\n\nHe concluded that “federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities.”\n\nThe Trump administration had said on Wednesday that it was sending U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to Alameda, Calif., to prepare for an operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. President Trump on Thursday called off the crackdown in the city, though it was unclear what that meant for the rest of the Bay Area.\n\nMr. Trump has sent federal agents and troops to other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C., saying the deployments will curb crime and illegal immigration. Critics have said that he is using the them to punish Democratic-led cities and spread fear in immigrant communities.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/24/us/us-federal-agents-national-guard-ice-fbi.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"22:24:04-04:00","title":"How to Make Sense of the Federal Forces on the Streets","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the expansion of federal immigration enforcement in major U.S. cities under President Trump’s deportation and anti-crime initiatives, detailing how agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the National Guard are now operating nationwide.

through Chicago and the National Guard patrolling Memphis, the variety of federal forces deployed to support President Trump’s mass deportation campaign and anticrime efforts continues to expand.\n\nOften, it can be difficult for the public to tell them apart, or to understand what powers each agency has. Here is a guide to how these forces are operating, including alongside local law enforcement.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement is the primary immigration law enforcement agency in the country, and its officers wear a variety of uniforms and identifiers.\n\nAgents’ vests may indicate which part of ICE the agents work for.\n\nAgents’ vests may indicate which part of ICE the agents work for.\n\nOfficers sometimes wear vests simply labeled “Police.”\n\nOfficers sometimes wear vests simply labeled “Police.”\n\nPhotos by John Moore/Getty Images (top); Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images (middle); Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images (bottom)\n\nICE is made up of two main branches. The officers of Enforcement and Removal Operations typically handle arrests and deportations. In the past, Homeland Security Investigations focused on transnational crimes, but Mr. Trump has called on its officers to make other arrests in the field.\n\nConfusion over immigration officers’ relationship to other law enforcement is not new. In 2020, community organizations in California sued ICE, claiming officers misrepresented themselves as the police during immigration operations. The lawsuit was settled in August and mandated that officers clearly identify themselves as ICE on their clothing.\n\nElsewhere, ICE officers may operate in plain clothes with no or minimal identification but are supposed to identify themselves during arrests.\n\nOne case involving a Turkish doctoral student sparked outrage when footage surfaced of plainclothes agents confronting her on the street outside Boston in March.\n\nICE officers in plain clothes show their badges as they approach a student to detain her.\n\nICE officers in plain clothes show their badges as they approach a student to detain her.\n\nStill other ICE officers may appear in full military-style fatigues, like the agency’s Special Response Teams, who are trained for high-risk operations. Since the anti-ICE summer protests in Los Angeles, they have also been guarding ICE facilities and making some street arrests.\n\nOfficers for ICE’s Special Response Team often carry crowd control equipment.\n\nOfficers for ICE’s Special Response Team \noften carry crowd control equipment.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is charged with law enforcement at the border, but Mr. Trump has deployed its agents nationwide to arrest immigrants. Within 100 miles of the border, they have greater authority than local law enforcement to conduct certain searches.\n\nOver plain clothes, Border Patrol agents often wear vests with their agency’s name.\n\nOver plain clothes, Border Patrol agents often wear vests with their agency’s name.\n\nBorder Patrol tactical teams  wear vest patches that can read “Border Patrol” or just “Police.”\n\nBorder Patrol tactical teams wear vest patches that can read “Border Patrol” or just “Police.”\n\nPhotos by Todd Heisler/The New York Times (top); Spencer Platt/Getty Images (bottom)\n\nAfter protests mounted over his immigration crackdown, Mr. Trump sent National Guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., citing a need to protect immigration agents and federal property. He also has called upon the National Guard to work alongside the local police in Memphis and Washington, D.C.\n\nNational Guard troops can carry shields, batons and rifles.\n\nNational Guard troops can carry shields, batons and rifles.\n\nPhoto by Robyn Beck/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n\nLocal officials in most of these cities, which are led by Democrats, have strongly objected to the deployments, saying Mr. Trump is misusing the Guard, a part-time military force that most often is called upon during natural disasters, wars or civil unrest.\n\nWhere the president’s deportation and crime-prevention campaigns intersect, the lines have blurred, and all types of law enforcement share overlapping roles.\n\nWhile immigration enforcement is the purview of ICE and Border Patrol, other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security and in the Justice Department have increasingly taken on this work.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Agency joins ICE officers at a raid on a home.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Agency joins ICE officers at a raid on a home.\n\nFederal agents load a man into an unmarked car during an immigration raid.\n\nFederal agents load a man into an unmarked car during an immigration raid.\n\nPhotos by D.E.A, via Reuters (top); Brian Snyder/Reuters (bottom)\n\nICE often conducts raids on residences, and the agency has revived workplace raids, a practice largely suspended under the previous administration. Officers more often now stop people on the street, sometimes detaining U.S. citizens. ICE and Border Patrol agents also make arrests at courthouse immigration hearings, a practice legal groups say violates due process protections.\n\nIn many places, the local police work directly with Homeland Security to arrest immigrants, or to detain them until immigration officers arrive.\n\nIn Washington, at least eight federal agencies were part of Mr. Trump’s efforts to take control of law enforcement. The local police helped immigration officers identify targets during stops for minor infractions, and immigration officers helped with arrests for nonimmigration crimes.\n\nMetropolitan Police work alongside Homeland Security officers at a checkpoint.\n\nMetropolitan Police work alongside Homeland Security officers at a checkpoint.\n\nA Homeland Security Investigations agent at the scene of a Metropolitan Police arrest.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations and Secret Service agents at the scene of a Metropolitan Police arrest.\n\nPhotos by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images (top); Kenny Holston/The New York Times (bottom)\n\nIn cities where the administration says its immigration enforcement is at risk, the National Guard and federal forces have worked side by side to secure federal buildings and to confront protesters.\n\nICE and Border Patrol face protesters at the Broadview immigration facility outside Chicago.\n\nICE and Border Patrol face protesters at the Broadview immigration facility outside Chicago.\n\nICE officers and National Guard members secure a federal building complex.\n\nICE officers and National Guard members secure a federal building complex.\n\nNational Guard members walk the beat \nwith Memphis Police.\n\nNational Guard members walk the beat \nwith Memphis Police.\n\nPhotos by Anthony Vazquez/Chicago Sun-Times, via Associated Press (top); David Ryder/Reuters (middle); George Walker IV/Associated Press (bottom)\n\nThe working relationship between the various law enforcement agencies is not always clear. The Chicago police were exposed to tear gas when federal agents tried to disperse a crowd in the city without warning this month. Homeland Security officials said the Chicago police did not respond to the scene of a car crash and shooting that involved federal agents, an account local officials dispute.\n\nThe deployment of militarized forces to major cities has drawn intense criticism from some residents, local leaders, and advocates for immigrants and civil liberties, who say the federal presence does more to stoke fear than to promote public safety.\n\nOf particular concern is that many federal forces are increasingly hiding their faces with masks and other coverings during street operations.\n\nICE agents wear masks inside an immigration courthouse.\n\nICE agents wear masks inside an immigration courthouse.\n\nBorder Patrol agents wear masks to arrest a street food vendor outside a Home Depot.\n\nBorder Patrol agents wear masks to arrest a street food vendor outside a Home Depot.\n\nPhotos by Olga Fedorova/Associated Press (top); Gregory Bull/Associated Press (bottom)\n\n“To witness a loved one, a neighbor, or community member being arrested before your very eyes by masked, unidentified men, is terrifying,” said Priscilla Olivarez, a senior policy attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which is based in San Antonio.\n\nThere is no federal law requiring immigration agents to reveal their faces or personal identities. A Homeland Security spokeswoman said agents wear masks to protect themselves from personal attacks, and that they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement even when masked.\n\nLocal law enforcement agencies often have stricter rules about identification. In Chicago, police officers may not wear face coverings, and in New York City, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, D.C., officers must prominently display their names and badge numbers on their uniforms.\n\nIn September, California passed legislation banning federal immigration officers from concealing their faces.

in recent weeks, masked federal agents have accosted people who appear to be Latino, and have confronted them with questions about their immigration status.\n\nTargeting people for immigration enforcement based on race or ethnicity alone was forbidden by the U.S. Supreme Court in a unanimous decision 50 years ago. After all, it’s impossible to determine the immigration statuses of people simply by looking at them. So for decades, agents seeking to question people about their citizenship were supposed to rely on more than just appearance.\n\nBut as President Trump has intensified his mass deportation campaign, roving patrols that have targeted predominantly Latino communities have become a key part of the administration’s playbook. And whether the tactics are legal appears to be an open question, one likely to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nLawsuits challenging the administration’s sweeps in Los Angeles and elsewhere are making their way through the courts. The outcomes could redefine the limits on the discretion officers have to stop, question and detain people over their immigration statuses and how much race and ethnicity can play into those decisions.\n\n“We are in nebulous land,” said Mark Fleming, a lawyer at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which is representing plaintiffs in Chicago. “We have never seen this type of enforcement on the streets ever.”\n\nLast month, in an emergency ruling in the Los Angeles suit, the Supreme Court said federal agents there could question people about their immigration statuses based solely on factors such as race or ethnicity or another spoken language or accented English.\n\nThe decision isn’t final, as it overturned the  temporary prohibition imposed by a federal judge on officers while she hears arguments on the case. But like many of the justices’ emergency decisions since the start of the new administration, the ruling appeared to signal substantial deference to the executive branch under President Trump and the possibility that the court would ultimately side with him should it ultimately issue an opinion on the case.\n\nIt is one of four legal challenges nationwide aiming to curb the warrantless arrests and traffic stops that have become a defining element of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.\n\nBut even as the lawyers mounting the challenges are hoping to affirm constitutional limits on such immigration stops and apprehensions, experts warn that the lawsuits could end up further emboldening officers to use race or ethnicity in immigration enforcement.\n\nThomas Coffin was part of the government legal team in the case that led to the 1975 Supreme Court ruling that race could not be the sole factor in immigration stops. Though he and his colleagues lost the case, Mr. Coffin, now 80, said the decision and others had established crucial rights to privacy. But whether they govern the federal agents conducting sweeps on American streets today is, he said, “the $64,000 question.”\n\nDuring the mass deportation campaign, Latinos have been stopped while driving gardening and landscaping trucks. They have been questioned and detained at bus stops and street corners where laborers gather to wait for work. They have been rounded up at farms, carwashes and construction sites.\n\nJosé Escobar Molina, 47, who had a temporary form of legal status for immigrants from El Salvador, said he was walking up to his work truck outside his apartment building in Washington, D.C., in August when he was confronted by agents, according to the lawsuit filed in Washington. Without asking for his name, identification or immigration status, the agents handcuffed him and drove him to a holding facility in Virginia, where he was forced to spend the night, he said in a declaration filed in court. When he was released a day later, an ICE agent apologized to him three times for the ordeal, Mr. Escobar Molina said.\n\nIn Chicago, where ICE tactics have escalated in recent weeks, lawyers say they have identified dozens of arrests that have violated a 2022 consent decree that covered six Midwestern states. The order — stemming from a 2018 class-action lawsuit that immigrant and civil rights groups filed against the first Trump administration on behalf of five immigrants — restricted federal immigration agents from apprehending and holding people without a warrant.\n\nIn court filings, government lawyers have asserted that federal agents are trained in the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures,” and that they should not be hobbled in their efforts to target unauthorized immigrants.\n\nCivil and immigrant rights groups have said the dragnets in different cities have violated the Constitution: Federal agents routinely approach people with brown skin or whom they perceive to be Latinos or immigrants. The agents ask who the people are and where they are from. If people refuse to answer or attempt to leave, they are held or handcuffed and sometimes subdued.\n\nIn the Los Angeles case, the lead plaintiff is a man named Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, one of several day laborers arrested at bus stops over the summer. Lawyers for the laborers say that federal agents are stopping Latino workers en masse without having reasonable suspicion, or being able to articulate a legal basis for believing that the people being questioned are in the country illegally.\n\nThe legal challenges in Chicago and Washington, D.C., say federal officers are detaining and arresting people without meeting an even higher legal standard of having “probable cause” to suspect that a person is in the country illegally.\n\nA fourth class-action case challenging both stops and arrests was filed in Mobile, Ala., on behalf of Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a Latino construction worker and U.S. citizen born in Florida who was held by immigration officials on two occasions this year.\n\nThe judge in the Los Angeles case issued an injunction, prohibiting federal agents in that part of California from conducting stops based on perceived race or ethnicity, or other factors, such as spoken Spanish or accented English.\n\nBut after an emergency appeal by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court reversed the judge in Los Angeles. Writing for the court’s conservative majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the injunction would “substantially hamper” efforts to enforce immigration laws in the Los Angeles area. He wrote that agents needed to be able to rely on their training and experience in “determining whether reasonable suspicion exists.”\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the court’s decision eroded freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” she said.\n\nBefore the Vasquez Perdomo decision, the court’s most influential ruling on immigration stops involved an American named Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce.\n\nOn an evening in March 1973, Border Patrol agents who were staked out on an interstate highway between San Diego and Los Angeles stopped Mr. Brignoni-Ponce’s car because its occupants appeared to the agents to be of Mexican descent.\n\nUpon discovering that two passengers did not have legal status, the federal agents arrested everyone and charged Mr. Brignoni-Ponce, a Marine Corps veteran and U.S. citizen of Puerto Rican ancestry, with knowingly transporting undocumented immigrants. But in a ruling two years later, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision throwing out the conviction, finding that officers could rely on “Mexican appearance” as a factor — but not the sole factor — in deciding to stop and question people about their citizenship.\n\nTo some critics of racial profiling, the decision seemed like a victory. But the ruling came to be seen by some experts as enabling racial profiling by allowing “Mexican appearance” to be a factor at all.\n\n“Since race can be one factor, in the exercise of discretion, it can become the dominant factor in an immigration stop,” said Kevin R. Johnson, the former dean of the School of Law at the University of California, Davis. “So it’s not surprising that for years you’ve heard the Latino community complaining not unreasonably that immigration stops are based on race.”\n\nKitty Bennett contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/daniel-lurie-trump-san-francisco.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:04:03-04:00","title":"How the San Francisco Mayor Avoided Trump’s Enforcement Surge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie successfully prevented a planned federal enforcement surge by engaging a network of influential tech billionaires and business leaders—such as Sam Altman, Marc Benioff, Jensen Huang, and Ron Conway—to deliver a calm, factual, and diplomatic message to President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.

Trump’s Enforcement Surge\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T05:04:03-04:00\n\nMayor Daniel Lurie of San Francisco did what he does best after the Trump administration prepared to send border agents to the Bay Area for a major crackdown on immigration this week.\n\nHe stayed calm. He worked the phones.\n\nHe “power mapped.”\n\nIn doing so, Mr. Lurie and his team visualized concentric circles of prominent business leaders who could persuade President Trump and determined who might lobby the executives to make those important calls. They wanted to deliver the message, in the most diplomatic way possible, that San Francisco was not the apocalyptic landscape that the president sees on Fox News.\n\nSoon, a host of billionaires with strong ties to the city were on the phone with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a former venture capitalist in San Francisco.\n\nFour people familiar with the situation described the City Hall discussions to The New York Times on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMr. Lurie, 48, a philanthropist and an heir to the Levi Strauss denim fortune, had never served in elected office until he became San Francisco’s mayor in January. To some fellow Democrats, he has been too scripted at a time that has called for brash leadership to counter Mr. Trump. Some have also resented his connections with tech billionaires.\n\nBut Mr. Lurie’s supporters say that his approach was simply an extension of his quiet leadership and his ability to work the levers behind the scenes in ways that few others can.\n\nHe leaned on Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI and a resident of the city’s Russian Hill neighborhood, who served on the mayor’s transition team before his inauguration. He relied on Marc Benioff, the Salesforce chief executive who was eager to move past his viral comments calling on Mr. Trump to send the National Guard to San Francisco — words he later recanted and apologized for.\n\nHe received help from Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia and the owner of a mansion on San Francisco’s Billionaire’s Row.\n\nRon Conway, the venture capitalist known as the Godfather of Silicon Valley, also lobbied behind the scenes. He called Republicans he thought could persuade Mr. Trump to back off.\n\nMr. Lurie wanted the intermediaries to be factual, persuasive, private and totally noncombative. That has been the mayor’s modus operandi since his inauguration.\n\nMr. Trump called Mr. Lurie late Wednesday night, and by the end of the conversation, the president had agreed to call off the surge in San Francisco that he had planned for Saturday, according to his post on Truth Social. Mr. Trump also said the tech leaders had vouched for the mayor’s efforts to increase public safety in San Francisco.\n\n“I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance,” Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday morning. “The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject.”\n\nIt was perhaps the most positive message Mr. Trump had delivered about San Francisco — or any Democratic-run city — this year. He has falsely said that Portland is “burning down” and that Chicago is a “war zone.”\n\nBrian Brokaw, a Democratic political strategist who ran a fund-raising committee that supported Mr. Lurie’s mayoral campaign, said that it was natural for the mayor to work behind the scenes and not engage in political battle with Mr. Trump.\n\nHe said Mr. Lurie had taken plenty of heat from donors and activists in San Francisco who wanted him to be more of a firebrand in speaking out this year, but he was not deterred.\n\n“At his core, he’s not a politician,” Mr. Brokaw said. “He never has been a politician, and performative actions for the sake of performance have never been his calling card.”\n\nThe mayor has focused this year on making small improvements to San Francisco, a city still recovering from the double whammy of a pandemic that hollowed out its downtown core and a deadly fentanyl epidemic that has killed thousands of people in the city in the past five years.\n\nHe has been a relentless cheerleader for San Francisco, posting constantly on Instagram about his jaunts around the city — surfing at Ocean Beach, jogging in Golden Gate Park or eating doughnuts at a bakery. “Let’s go, San Francisco!” he often says.\n\nHe has avoided discussing national politics so much that he even refuses to say the name Trump in public. He rarely goes off message and does not seem particularly comfortable in front of cameras.\n\nMr. Lurie said during a Thursday news conference at City Hall that he had spoken that morning to Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, and Attorney General Pam Bondi. He said he had agreed to have the city work with Ms. Bondi on an effort to “combat fentanyl and hold drug traffickers accountable.”\n\nWhile San Franciscans breathed a sigh of relief that a federal incursion was no longer days away, some were concerned that he might have made concessions to Trump administration members reviled by many Democrats.\n\nSupervisor Jackie Fielder, who represents the Mission District, a heavily Latino neighborhood, said she had texted Mr. Lurie on Thursday to say that his actions were “shameful.” She said that he should not have welcomed any federal agencies into San Francisco because they could easily try to arrest immigrants and provoke violence.\n\n“I don’t know what world the mayor is living in,” Ms. Fielder said.\n\nThere was also some resentment that Mr. Lurie had secured safety for San Francisco without getting similar assurances for the surrounding Bay Area. (He said in his news conference that he and the president had talked only about San Francisco.)\n\nAcross the bay in Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee, other local leaders and activists were concerned that Mr. Trump might still conduct intensive raids in their city. The president said in August that he was eyeing Oakland for federal action because of what he called its high crime rates.\n\nSome wondered if race had played a role in the president’s thinking — and in his ultimate reversal in San Francisco this week. Though Portland, Ore., has a white mayor, most of the cities targeted by Mr. Trump so far have Black mayors.\n\n“Some folks think that this means that he’ll turn around and zero in on Oakland,” said Cat Brooks, a local activist and executive director of the Anti Police-Terror Project. “There’s more Black people here. There’s a Black mayor.”\n\nMr. Trump’s administration has said it targets cities based on crime rates, not because of the race of their mayors.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago has taken an approach different from that of Mr. Lurie, sparring with the president as Mr. Trump has attempted to send the National Guard into his city. In an interview on Thursday, he said that the influence of wealthy tech leaders in sparing San Francisco was “proof positive” that the federal incursions were not motivated by data or concerns about safety.\n\n“It’s very obvious that this is political, and he essentially only listens to billionaires,” Mr. Johnson said. “If the only way in which you can communicate with this president is to be a billionaire, that leaves out the vast, vast majority of everyday people.”\n\nMr. Johnson said it was of paramount importance that people continue to resist, regardless of what worked for Mr. Lurie in San Francisco.\n\n“Perhaps there are folks who believe that somehow if you just close your eyes, he’ll leave you alone,” he said. “That’s not how we protect our democracy in this moment.”\n\nStill, in San Francisco, many leaders were grateful for Mr. Lurie’s maneuvers. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, praised his “exceptional leadership.”\n\n“I salute Mayor Lurie for standing up for our city and reinforcing San Francisco’s strength, optimism and recovery,” she said in a statement.\n\nMr. Lurie’s quiet, head-down demeanor has stood out this year, especially in a city accustomed to strong voices like Ms. Pelosi and larger-than-life mayors like Gavin Newsom and Willie Brown.\n\nThe latter was where he always is on a Thursday afternoon: the corner table of Sam’s Grill downtown, munching on sourdough bread. Mr. Brown, 91, praised Mr. Lurie for ensuring that the president ultimately received a factual portrayal of San Francisco.\n\n“He clearly had very good, quality, smart advice on dealing with Trump,” said Mr. Brown, known as one of the savviest politicians in modern California history.\n\n“He is really either unusually talented or lucky,” Mr. Brown continued to say about the new mayor. “I go with luck.”\n\nReporting was contributed by Cade Metz in San Francisco and Laurel Rosenhall in Sacramento.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/style/renovations-at-the-white-house-arent-unusual-but-trumps-makeover-is.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:00:08-04:00","title":"Renovations at the White House Aren’t Unusual.

Andrew M. Cuomo laughed along with a conservative radio host on Thursday who said that Zohran Mamdani, a Muslim mayoral candidate, would celebrate another Sept. 11-style terrorist attack on New York City.\n\nWithin hours, the exchange ricocheted across the campaign trail, where Mr. Mamdani and a cross-section of Democrats denounced the conversation as Islamophobic and outside the bounds of even a heated campaign.\n\nThe episode began as part of a friendly interview between the radio host, Sid Rosenberg, and Mr. Cuomo, who is openly courting Republican votes as he attempts to catch Mr. Mamdani in the polls before Nov. 4.\n\nMr. Cuomo, 67, had been arguing that Mr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker and Democratic nominee, was dangerously unprepared to lead a city as large as New York through events like natural disasters or the deadly Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack.\n\n“God forbid another 9/11,” he said. “Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?”\n\nMr. Rosenberg, who had already referred to Mr. Mamdani as a “terrorist,” interjected. “Yeah, I could,” he said. “He’d be cheering.”\n\nAfter a brief pause, Mr. Cuomo chuckled. “That’s another problem,” he said.\n\nAt a news conference in Manhattan, Mr. Mamdani called the exchange “disgusting” and an affront to the city’s sizable Muslim population, which was subject to surveillance and Islamophobia in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n“We’re talking about a radio show host who’s described me as an animal, who’s called me a terrorist,” he said. “We’re speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, is also disgusting, and is his final closing argument with less than two weeks before Election Day.”\n\nOther New York Democrats joined in, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and some lawmakers who have criticized Mr. Mamdani’s own pointed rhetoric about Israel.\n\nRepresentative Daniel S. Goldman, who just this week said he was “very concerned” about Mr. Mamdani’s language about Israel, called the suggestion that the candidate would cheer on a terrorist attack “naked Islamophobia.”\n\nRepresentative Gregory W. Meeks, the moderate head of the Queens Democratic Party, sounded pained after listening to the exchange. He said it called to mind a moment in the 2008 presidential campaign when John McCain, the Republican candidate, publicly disagreed with supporters portraying his Democratic rival, Barack Obama, as a threat to American security, including one who said she had heard Mr. Obama was “an Arab.”\n\nMr. Cuomo, Mr. Meeks said in an interview, should have followed that model.\n\n“It’s easy to be silent, but the right thing would have been to say something,” he said. “You might not agree with Mamdani on other things, but he is a citizen of this country and he wouldn’t be smiling or laughing at that kind of attack.”\n\nAnd Representative Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat who has had his own sharp disagreements with Mr. Mamdani over Israel, wrote on X that “to insinuate that a mayoral candidate would celebrate a second 9/11 is beyond disgusting and disgraceful.”\n\nA spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said the governor did not believe Mr. Mamdani would celebrate a terrorist attack.\n\nBut when asked about the episode at a news conference hours later, Mr. Cuomo did not denounce Mr. Rosenberg’s comments. Instead, he stressed that they were not his words.\n\n“That’s the host. Go talk to the host,” he said, referring to Mr. Rosenberg, an outspoken ally of President Trump who has hosted Mr. Cuomo on his show three times in recent days.\n\nMr. Cuomo said that when he replied to Mr. Rosenberg, he had been thinking about how Mr. Mamdani “pals around” with Hasan Piker, a popular streamer who once said America “deserved 9/11.” He said Mr. Mamdani would not condemn those remarks.\n\nBut in fact, Mr. Mamdani said last week that he found Mr. Piker’s comment “objectionable and reprehensible.”\n\nThe backlash came at a time when Mr. Cuomo and others trying to stop Mr. Mamdani are adopting ever more dire language and racialized imagery to describe Mr. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, and his potential mayoralty.\n\nLate Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo’s campaign posted, and then took down, an A.I.-generated video depicting Mr. Mamdani’s supporters as trespassers, domestic abusers, pimps, drug dealers and drunken drivers, and showing a Black shoplifter in a kaffiyeh.\n\nThe video called Mr. Mamdani an “inexperienced radical” and portrayed him eating rice with his hands, a common practice among South Asians that has been frequently invoked by the right to mock Mr. Mamdani. Mr. Azzopardi said the video was posted “in error” by a junior staff member.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, accused Mr. Mamdani in the race’s final debate of supporting “global jihad.” Mr. Mamdani bristled. “I have never, not once” supported jihad or other forms of violence, he said, suggesting that the term was a smear connected to his Muslim faith.\n\nAnd on Thursday, a super PAC supporting Mr. Cuomo’s candidacy began running an advertisement featuring a photo of Mr. Mamdani smiling with a Brooklyn imam as the words “Jihad on NYC” passed on the screen. The words were said two decades ago by the imam, but appeared in the ad over Mr. Mamdani’s face.\n\nMr. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to parents of Indian descent, would be New York’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor. He has described his experience of the 2001 terrorist attacks as a young boy in New York City, when he said, many Muslims were “marked an ‘other.’”\n\nIt was not the first time the campaign has been consumed by accusations of hate and bigotry. Mr. Mamdani, who has closely associated himself with the cause of Palestinians, faced overwhelming criticism before the primary when he declined to denounce the phrase ”globalize the intifada,” which many Jews consider a call to violence. He has since said he would discourage its use. He has also repeatedly denounced antisemitism.\n\nMr. Mamdani on Thursday accused Mr. Cuomo of hypocrisy, saying that Thursday’s radio interview showed “both how hollow his commitments are and how he is, in fact, the illustration of the very division he says that he would fight.”\n\nMr. Cuomo, who is running as a third-party candidate, received some backup from a new ally.\n\nStanding alongside him on Thursday to endorse his candidacy, Mayor Eric Adams said he was motivated to stop Mr. Mamdani for a variety of reasons, including that he had not outright condemned the phrase “globalize the intifada.”\n\nThen he veered into a tangent. “New York can’t be Europe, folks. I don’t know what is wrong with people,” he said. “You see what’s playing out in other countries because of Islamic extremism.”\n\nMr. Rosenberg, the radio host, responded separately to people criticizing Mr. Cuomo on X, saying “Andrew didn’t say @ZohranKMamdani would be cheering if God Forbid we experienced another 9/11 I said it!!!”\n\n“I’ll be sure to invite all of you to ‘Hug a Terrorist Day’ hosted by @ZohranKMamdani,” he wrote in another.\n\nDebra Kamin contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/opinion/east-wing-white-house-patti-davis-reagan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:03:47-04:00","title":"When My Family Lived in the White House I Resented It.

Now I Mourn It.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T05:03:47-04:00\n\nI first went into the White House when my father, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated in January 1981. It was afternoon and I had been assigned an inaugural ball to attend later. A ball gown was waiting for me; so was a hairdresser who insisted that my hair had to be pinned up. I was the rebellious first daughter who didn’t want to be first daughter. I wanted my life back — a life that didn’t have armed agents following me and reporters writing about me, a life with no ball gowns at all.\n\nSwept up in my own personal drama, I was blind to the much greater drama of my surroundings, the history brushing past me in the White House’s long hallways. (When my family got a Cavalier King Charles spaniel named Rex, he stood near the Lincoln Bedroom barking his little head off at no one, in what my father insisted was an encounter with Lincoln’s ghost. I waited in vain for my own encounter with the ghost, so I could complain to him about all the intrusions into my life.)\n\nI visited the White House many more times over the next eight years, and though I could see well enough that it was a nice building, I was always counting the hours until I could leave.\n\nThen my father left office, and it wasn’t until many years later, after his death, that I returned to the White House. My family was in Washington for the memorial, and my brother, his wife and I were offered a tour to fill the long empty morning before the service. As soon as we entered the building, through the East Wing, I felt history fold itself around me.\n\nEverything had meaning — the feel of our footsteps on the marble floors, the thick hush amid constant activity. Our guide talked about how Franklin Roosevelt added to the East Wing in 1942, how Rosalynn Carter was the first first lady to have a formally dedicated office there. I walked through the White House as if I had never been there before because, in a way, I hadn’t. I hadn’t been present and open to the echoes of the past, to all that was left behind from those who made their mark on America, who walked those same floors, breathed that same air, looked out the same windows. I was awe-struck.\n\nThe images we’ve now all seen of the East Wing being demolished are heartbreaking. Over the centuries, many presidents have altered the White House, and certainly older buildings need to be updated and repaired. But this is complete destruction.\n\nAmong certain jaded observers, there’s been a strain of chatter dismissing the damage, saying the East Wing was never all that architecturally distinguished. But it was not just a building made of brick and plaster; it was the people’s house, a building suffused with the spirit of the ideals that built it. It was a building that invited you to look beyond your own life, your own reality, to something bigger, a huge story we all inhabit. To stand in such a place makes you feel small, yet also larger than just yourself. It makes you aware of the continuum of history in a way that feels akin to sacredness.\n\nAnd now the East Wing is gone. I’m grateful that I had that chance to re-enter the White House and see it through more open eyes, experience it without my own resentments getting in the way. Now no one else will get to walk across that threshold and feel the richness of that history brush past them. It was where Eleanor Roosevelt walked. It was where Jacqueline Kennedy planned the Rose Garden.\n\nWe silence so much when we tear down places that are there to teach us, inspire us, humble us. Ghosts and memories drift away in the dust, the wreckage, and we are all poorer as a result.\n\nPatti Davis is the author of “Dear Mom and Dad: A Letter About Family, Memory and the America We Once Knew.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The demolition included the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and the East Colonnade, sparking widespread outrage from preservationists, Democrats, and former staff who viewed it as a symbolic and cultural loss. The East Wing had deep historical roots, including its role during World War II as a shelter for President Franklin D.

It had stood for 123 years.\n\nBuilt in 1902 during the Theodore Roosevelt administration as an entryway for guests arriving in carriages, and rebuilt in the 1940s during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, the East Wing met its end under orders from President Trump. He dismissed it this week as “a very small building” that was in the way of his planned 90,000-square-foot, $300 million ballroom.\n\nA New York Times analysis of satellite imagery showed that the demolition included the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and the East Colonnade, which connected the East Wing to the White House and included the president’s theater.\n\nThe East Wing’s destruction prompted outrage from preservationists and Democrats, and mourning from those who once worked there.\n\n“There was never a day I didn’t catch my breath walking into the East Wing,” said Laura Schwartz, the White House director of events in the Clinton administration. “That’s what makes the loss to me so painful. It’s not just a building. It’s the living history.”\n\n“It was such a breath of fresh air from the West Wing,” said Stephanie Grisham, a White House press secretary and chief of staff to Melania Trump, the first lady, during Mr. Trump’s first term. “I hate to see that kind of history literally being demolished in front of our eyes.’‘\n\nJeremy Bernard, who served four years as social secretary under President Barack Obama, recalled the East Wing as the all-important first impression of the White House for guests. Since almost everyone invited — including titans of industry, movie stars and Nobel Prize winners — had to first snake through long outdoor lines of Secret Service checks, often in cold or heat, he said he had tried to make sure that the East Wing “really popped out” with decorations and live music.\n\n“Everyone felt welcomed after going through the horror of security,” he said.\n\nNot everyone was nostalgic. Gahl Hodges Burt, who was social secretary for three years under President Ronald Reagan, said that tearing down the East Wing to make space for the ballroom was an unfortunate necessity, and that change was overdue. Since the State Dining Room holds only 140 seated guests and the East Room has space for 200 at most, recent administrations have taken to erecting enormous tents on the South Lawn for ever larger state dinners.\n\n“Putting up a tent does nothing but make people upset that they’ve come to a state dinner but they never get inside the White House,” Ms. Burt said. “The only bathroom facilities for a tent are porta-potties. Setting up a kitchen out there is hugely expensive. When the tent is up, the helicopter can’t land. And the grass dies.” (Ms. Burt was referring to the presidential helicopter, Marine One.)\n\nMs. Burt, a board member of the White House Historical Association, added that larger spaces for East Wing offices are “very much needed.” The White House has said that office space is included in Mr. Trump’s plans for the ballroom.\n\nDespite those who found the East Wing deficient, it did cast a spell. “I’m sentimental about it as a place where I spent so much blood, sweat and tears,” said Michael LaRosa, the press secretary to Jill Biden, who as first lady worked in her East Wing office most days.\n\nMr. LaRosa, who agreed with Ms. Burt that a ballroom was needed to replace the behemoth tents  — “the French have the Élysée Palace and here we are having a lawn party” — said he had fond memories of Dr. Biden bringing Willow, the family cat, to her office.\n\nThey closed the French doors, he said, to keep Willow from roaming the White House. “The calligraphers made this nice sign: ‘Please keep doors shut, Willow on the prowl,’” he said.\n\n“At the end of the day sometimes we would just have a glass of wine — me, Anthony and Jill — and just talk, and not take everything so seriously,” Mr. LaRosa said, referring to Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser to Dr. Biden at the time.\n\nIn its 123 years of history, two modern East Wing incidents stand out.\n\nIn 2009, in what passed as a scandal at the time, a pair of uninvited guests and aspiring television reality stars, Michaele and Tareq Salahi, slipped past multiple layers of security outside the East Wing and made it into the first state dinner of the Obama administration. There, they were able to literally rub shoulders with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, Secret Service agents propelled Vice President Dick Cheney out of his chair in his West Wing office and rushed him to a tunnel leading to a bunker below the East Wing, officially called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, which had been built as a shelter for President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. Mr. Cheney entered the tunnel at 9:37 a.m., the moment that American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.\n\nThe East Wing never had the political importance or cachet of the West Wing, which houses the Oval Office. But it became prominent, and controversial, in its rebuilding during World War II, when Republicans denounced the cost as wasteful. Constructed as a two-story wing in the same neoclassical style as the White House, it covered up Roosevelt’s new underground shelter.\n\n“The secretive nature of the construction, tied to military purposes, further fueled suspicions,” Stewart McLaurin, the president of the White House Historical Association, wrote on the group’s website. “However, the East Wing’s utility in supporting the modern presidency eventually quieted critics.’’\n\nUntil Thursday, the ground floor of the East Wing housed the White House visitors’ office and the Office of Legislative Affairs, while the second floor was home to the White House Military Office and the offices of the first lady, her staff and the calligraphers.\n\nPresidents watched the Super Bowl and showed movies before their release in the theater in the colonnade, which was used as a coat check for big events. During holiday parties, a band would often play Christmas carols just outside the East Wing entrance as guests arrived.\n\nThe personality of the East Wing was always calmer and less intense than that of the testosterone-filled West Wing, although as first lady, Hillary Clinton kept an office there and seldom used her one in the East Wing. She expressed outrage earlier this week about Mr. Trump’s tear down, writing on X: “It’s not his house” but “your house,” and “he’s destroying it.” As of midday Thursday, the post had 28 million views.\n\nMelania Trump visited the East Wing so infrequently during her husband’s first term that her empty office there was converted into a gift-wrapping room.\n\nIt is unclear how many times she has been there in the second term, or if she had any input into her husband’s grand plans.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/nyc-ballot-measures-proposals.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:52:21-04:00","title":"There Are 6 Ballot Measures in New York City.

Here’s an Overview.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T07:52:21-04:00\n\nThis election cycle in New York City has been dominated by the mayor’s race, with the candidates sparring over crime, affordability and the war in Gaza. But the six proposals that will appear on the back of ballots could also have a major impact.\n\nProposal 1, about protected land, goes before voters across the state. But the other measures were written for New York City voters. At least three of them could significantly diminish the power the City Council has over housing development.\n\nThose measures have ignited a fiery response from the Council, which says they will leave neighborhoods unable to shape their future and instead hand power to housing developers and the mayor. Their proponents say they are crucial for addressing the city’s housing shortage.\n\nProposals 2 through 6 were written, with public input, by the 13-member Charter Revision Commission that Mayor Eric Adams created in December, setting up a face-off between City Hall and the City Council.\n\nEarly voting begins in New York on Saturday, Oct. 25, and Election Day is Nov. 4. Here is what to know about the ballot measures.\n\nThe Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex in Essex County, which hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics, extends into more than 300 acres of protected forest lands in the Adirondack Park in violation of the State Constitution, which says part of the park shall be “forever wild.”\n\nA “yes” vote would amend the Constitution to authorize the complex retroactively. The proposal’s passage would trigger legislation banning most further development not directly related to the complex. Gov. Kathy Hochul would need to sign that legislation.\n\nThe state would be required to add at least 2,500 acres to the protected lands to offset the loss of land to the complex.\n\nA “no” vote would leave the Constitution as is, and the complex would remain in violation of it.\n\nThe Adirondack Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, said in a statement that it would be best for “the human and ecological communities of the Adirondacks.”\n\nCouncilman Robert Holden, a Queens Democrat, said in a statement he was opposed to “carving exceptions into the Constitution for new construction on protected lands. Once we weaken these safeguards, it becomes easier to do it again.”\n\nNew York City is dealing with a dire housing shortage.\n\nA “yes” vote would make it easier and faster to approve housing projects financed by the city, which are typically the most affordable. The City Council would not get to vote on mixed-income housing developments in the dozen community districts where the least housing has been built over the preceding five years.\n\nA “no” vote would leave the current system in place, where nearly all of these types of housing projects must go through a land use process and ultimately be approved by the City Council.\n\nThe measure was one of the five written by Mr. Adams’s charter commission, and supporters view it as a simple way to speed up development of affordable housing. Mr. Adams blames the shortage, in part, on “member deference” — an unofficial veto that council members hold over new developments in their districts.\n\nAlec Schierenbeck, the executive director of the commission, said its proposals would “create faster, simpler, and less political processes for the types of development that New Yorkers frequently say they want most: affordable housing and modest projects that fit into the existing neighborhood fabric.”\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo is the only mayoral candidate that supports the measure. It is also backed by Gov. Kathy Hochul; Brad Lander, the city comptroller; and the borough presidents of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThe City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams, has characterized the measure as a mayoral power grab.\n\nThey say that diminishing the City Council’s power over new developments removes the ability of members to negotiate benefits — like parks, subsidies for low-income renters and infrastructure upgrades — from City Hall and developers.\n\nThe Council has sent mailers out claiming the measure would lead to “less affordable housing,” “fewer quality parks” and “more gentrification.”\n\n“We have real housing challenges, but these are false solutions,” said Julia Agos, a spokeswoman for the City Council.\n\nSeveral major labor unions are also opposed, including Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union and the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council. City Council members are often able to extract gains for unionized workers by threatening a veto over projects.\n\nThe Democratic nominee in the mayor’s race, Zohran Mamdani, has conspicuously not taken a position on the measure. The Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, opposes it.\n\nThis proposal for “modest” projects — up to 30 percent bulkier than current rules allow, or up to 45 feet tall — would allow such proposals to move forward more quickly.\n\nA “yes” vote would shorten the approval process to three months from roughly seven. The City Council would no longer have the final say. That would come from the City Planning Commission, where the majority of members are appointed by the mayor.\n\nA “no” vote would leave the current process in place.\n\nA coalition of politicians, civic leaders and groups — including Mr. Adams, Ms. Hochul, Mr. Lander, Mr. Cuomo and others — support Proposal 3.\n\nThey say that these types of “modest” developments will be more attractive to developers and therefore more likely to be built if the process is streamlined.\n\nThe City Council, some labor unions, and Mr. Sliwa are also against this proposal.\n\nThey say shifting the power from the City Council to the Planning Commission gives more authority to the mayor and removes the ability of individual council members to extract better benefits for their districts.\n\nMr. Mamdani has not taken a position.\n\nA “yes” vote would give a new three-member board — made up of the mayor, the Council speaker and the local borough president — the power to reverse City Council decisions to reject or modify many mixed-income housing proposals.\n\nA “no” vote would leave the current system in place, where individual council members, with rare exceptions, decide the fate of development projects in their districts.\n\nThis is perhaps the most contentious of the commission’s four housing proposals. It is, however, supported by the same group that supports Proposal 2 and 3.\n\nSupporters say that the unofficial veto held by individual council members ensures that many projects do not get proposed at all if there is a hint of opposition. And while the veto power may help defend the interest of a single neighborhood, supporters say the housing crisis should be tackled as a citywide problem.\n\nThe same opponents point out how the proposal would undermine the power of the City Council.\n\nDevelopers could negotiate directly with the mayor and borough president and ignore the local council member, critics say.\n\n“This would give the city and developers significantly more power to disregard the needs of neighborhoods,” the City Council says on its website.\n\nCurrently, each borough president is in charge of maintaining paper maps of each borough. The maps are the official record of street lines and street grades, and the locations of public parks and open space.\n\nA “yes” vote would require the city to consolidate and digitize the map under the planning commission.\n\nA “no” vote would keep the current map system in place.\n\nUnlike the three housing-related proposals, this one has seen little opposition.\n\nElections for city offices like mayor and public advocate are held in odd-numbered years at four-year intervals (like 2021 and 2025), while presidential elections are held in even years at four-year intervals (like 2020 and 2024).\n\nThere is typically more turnout for presidential elections. Just 23 percent of registered voters cast ballots in New York City’s mayoral election in 2021, while 60 percent participated in the 2024 presidential election, according to the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\n\nA “yes” vote would move city elections to even years. This would amend the State Constitution and would need to be also approved by two consecutive State Legislatures and by voters in a statewide referendum.\n\nA “no” vote would keep the election schedule the same.\n\nMoving city elections to even-numbered years could help “increase voter turnout, promote a more representative electorate and reduce election administration costs,” the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, has said.\n\nThe Charter Revision Commission said it would save an estimated $42 million every two years.\n\nIn a statement submitted in favor of the proposal, the Center for Independence of the Disabled in New York said “higher-turnout elections typically come with more investment in accessible poll sites, better training for poll workers and greater outreach to voters.”\n\nOne member of the Charter Revision Commission, Diane Savino, said that she had concerns that holding the elections simultaneously could end up diverting attention from local races.\n\nErrol Louis, a New York magazine columnist, agreed. “National political dynamics would inevitably cause vital city issues unique to New York to get swallowed, distorted, or ignored,” he wrote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/politics/white-house-renovations-trump-ballroom.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"19:10:16-04:00","title":"From Truman to Trump: A Tale of Two White House Renovations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article compares the historically grounded, transparent, and safety-driven renovation of the White House under President Harry S.

Truman undertook a large-scale renovation of the White House in the 1940s, the place was in such a state of disrepair that the leg of his daughter’s piano fell through the floor.\n\nAs he embarked on a major overhaul, Mr. Truman involved stakeholders far and wide.\n\nWorking with the House and Senate, Mr. Truman appointed a bipartisan, six-person commission to oversee the project. He consulted the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Commission of Fine Arts, which approved sketches made by Lorenzo S. Winslow, the White House architect, as well as smaller details like fabric samples and color schemes.\n\nFunds for the project — more than $5 million at the time — were approved by Congress after significant debate.\n\nPresident Trump, who is carrying out the biggest construction project on the White House grounds since the Truman administration, is bypassing all of that.\n\nHe demolished the East Wing on his own authority and at breakneck speed to make way for a $300 million ballroom. Only days after heavy machinery began smashing into the East Wing, it was a pile of rubble on Thursday — even though Mr. Trump initially said the project would not dismantle parts of the White House.\n\n“Truman was a student of history, and he definitely wanted to have a lot of eyes on what was going on,” said Jon Taylor, a historian at the University of Central Missouri who has written four books about Mr. Truman. “It was not like we go in and we’re going to demolish, and then we’re going to decide. They were very intentional going in about what needed to be done.”\n\nMr. Trump has not taken the project to Congress for funding or debate, instead saying he and private donors would provide the money. No bipartisan commission is overseeing the construction. Money for the project is going into a fund that is not subject to transparency laws.\n\nAnd while some Democrats have declared Mr. Trump’s actions to be illegal, the president was able to circumvent the strict review process for historic buildings because of a provision in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 that exempts many federal buildings, including the White House.\n\nMr. Trump did not submit plans related to the demolition to the National Capital Planning Commission, which reviews federal development projects.\n\nIn July, the Trump administration installed Will Scharf, Mr. Trump’s staff secretary and former personal lawyer, as the commission’s chairman.\n\nMr. Scharf has said that it was unnecessary for Mr. Trump to go to the commission ahead of a demolition, but that he expects the president to submit plans for the ballroom before the construction phase of the project.\n\nMr. Trump is not expected to involve Congress, and has said he is not seeking taxpayer dollars. Instead, the financial director of Mr. Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, Meredith O’Rourke, has been raising private funds for the ballroom. That money is being deposited in the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit, tax-exempt entity that is not subject to transparency laws.\n\nThe White House has released a list of donors that features some of the most influential businesses in the country, including Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton, Caterpillar, Coinbase and Comcast.\n\nMr. Trump’s ballroom plans also differ drastically from Mr. Truman’s renovation.\n\n“The reason that these renovations went forward is because they were absolutely necessary for the place to be livable,” Marc Selverstone, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, said of Mr. Truman’s renovations. “And that seems to be quite a different rationale than the one that is being provided now.”\n\nIn 1947, while Mr. Truman took a bath upstairs, a Blue Room chandelier threatened to crash down on his wife and her guests directly below. He said the upstairs floor “sagged and moved like a ship at sea.” The following year, his daughter Margaret’s piano broke through the floor of the family quarters.\n\nUpon investigating the situation in 1948, engineers confirmed that the White House was in danger of collapse.\n\nThe beams holding up the State Dining Room “should have fallen long ago” and were “staying up there from force of habit only,” W. E. Reynolds, commissioner of the Public Building Service, wrote to Mr. Truman. The East Room ceiling had drooped six inches, with cracks “rapidly extending outward indicating immediate danger of the ceiling falling,” Howell G. Crim, the chief usher of the White House, wrote.\n\nDecades later, the White House is not in nearly as rough shape. The East Wing had been used for years for the first lady’s offices and ceremonial purposes, and as the entrance to the White House for millions of tourists.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said there would not be much to miss.\n\n“It was never thought of as being much,” he said of the East Wing. “It was a very small building.”\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, defended Mr. Trump’s approach to the project on Thursday, saying he was not the first president to refurbish the White House. She did acknowledge that Mr. Trump’s initial, less destructive, plans had changed.\n\n“With any construction project, there are changes over time as you assess what the project is going to look like,” she said.\n\n“The East Wing is going to be more beautiful and modern than ever before,” she added. “And in addition, there will be a big, beautiful ballroom that can hold big parties and state visits for generations to come.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/realestate/luxury-wasp-nest.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:02:05-04:00","title":"There’s a Wasp Nest in the Living Room.

Living Room. On Purpose.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T05:02:05-04:00\n\nThink of it as an alternative houseplant, a method for decorating an indoor space with a bit of the great outdoors. Wasp nests have become a surprisingly sought-after home décor commodity, with some priced at up to $250 per specimen.\n\nThe nests have a kind of odd beauty that has compelled people to hang them in their living rooms, offices and dining spaces. They are one of a kind, hard to retrieve and, unlike houseplants, cannot be cultivated. As swaths of the country decorate their homes with fall’s bounty — pumpkins, gourds, spooky bric-a-brac — a select group climbs multistory ladders to harvest these prized nests after their inhabitants largely die off in the first few autumn frosts.\n\nWhen brought indoors as decoration, the wasps’ onetime home assumes the role of a natural sculpture, with a look that both “elevates living spaces” and evokes an “air of danger,” said Anthony Vesnaver, a founder of the Newburgh Vintage Emporium in Newburgh, N.Y.\n\nFor years, Kyle Vierling, a florist in Sylvania, Ohio, had one such nest displayed on his living room shelf, with the branches it was built on still attached — further accentuating its organic form and make. Recently, Mr. Vierling incorporated the specimen, which he described as “special and ephemeral,” into an arrangement using Japanese ikebana principles, mixed with other foraged components.\n\nCity dwellers looking to add a touch of nature to their homes are often the ones interested in the nests, Mr. Vesnaver said. He said he had sold three at his antique mall in the last month. “It’s people with a keen view on aesthetics,” Mr. Vesnaver added. He attributed their popularity to a reaction against mass-produced interior products.\n\nOnly one stinging insect creates these variegated, collaged-looking nests: the North American baldfaced hornet. A type of wasp, it spends much of its brief life cycle, which lasts from spring to winter, building these hanging abodes for its colony and queen.\n\nA small nudge of one of these nests can dent its outer layer, and therefore shipping them is risky business. While the nests at Mr. Vesnaver’s store cost $40 to $70, many sellers on online marketplaces like Etsy price theirs upward of $150, with shipping fees sometimes hovering around $100.\n\nDan Duchene is one such Etsy dealer selling baldfaced hornet nests for luxury prices, including a 16-inch specimen listed for $270. He likened it to nature’s version of an architectural model.\n\nMr. Duchene, who lives in Pembroke, Ontario, across the Ottawa River from Quebec, said he recently sold another nest to an engineer who appreciated the complexities of the habitat that the hornets had built for themselves. That notion of domesticity and hard work, Mr. Duchene thinks, is part of their appeal.\n\nWhile some buy the nests, others harvest them straight from the source: outside and often very high in tree canopies. There’s only a short window of time to retrieve the nests responsibly. One must wait long enough after the first few frosts to ensure that a nest is empty, but act soon enough so that its paper-thin construction is not damaged by wind, rain or hungry birds.\n\nNathan Brown, a horticultural designer in Reno, Nev., purchased a 30-foot ladder to nab a larger nest that was lodged high in a tree at a local park. While he returned the $400 ladder soon after, he has kept the nest as part of a dried floral arrangement in his dining room. Mr. Brown has since acquired a second nest and mounted it to his wall like an artwork. “It’s a conversation piece,” he said.\n\nThe nests’ unique appearance comes from how they are built. Baldfaced hornets chew wood like dead tree stumps and backyard decks and create a pulp-like material that becomes a paper. It’s laid down in a particular pattern that ultimately becomes a series of interconnected rainbow-shaped sheets, said Tice Jacques, the proprietor of Coastal Stinging Solutions, a pest-control business based in Belfast, Maine.\n\nMr. Jacques has come to appreciate the nests’ look, so much so that he has a collection of some 150 of them displayed in his home. “There’s no comparison between them,” he said. “To me it’s art.”\n\nWasp nests have also proven a prolific source of inspiration for artists. The fiber artist Kay Sekimachi has used nest paper to craft small home objects like bowls. In 2019, the New York City-based artist Juan Antonio Olivares created an immersive installation in Berlin with two larger baldfaced hornet nests accompanied by sound and lighting effects.\n\n“The paper they create is so beautiful and painterly, it could have been done with a brush,” said Wendy Wahl, an artist in West Kingston, R.I., who has deconstructed wasp nests found in her own yard for a series of collage works.\n\nMs. Wahl often works with natural materials she finds on her property. At one point, she was so committed to working with mushrooms that she started growing them. The wasp nest paper, however, has proved more difficult.\n\n“I can’t create a nest,” Ms. Wahl said. “I have to wait for them to do it.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/white-house-boats-law.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:06:42-04:00","title":"The Peril of a White House That Flaunts Its Indifference to the Law","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article criticizes President Donald Trump’s order to the U.S. military to carry out lethal strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, claiming they are acts of armed conflict.

returned to office nine months ago, President Trump has sought to expand executive power across numerous fronts. But his claim that he can lawfully order the military to summarily kill people accused of smuggling drugs on boats off the coast of South America stands apart.\n\nA broad range of specialists in laws governing the use of lethal force have called Mr. Trump’s orders to the military patently illegal. They say the premeditated extrajudicial killings have been murders — regardless of whether the 37 people blown apart, burned alive or drowned in nine strikes so far were indeed running drugs.\n\nThe administration insists that the killings are lawful, invoking legal terms like “self-defense” and “armed conflict.” But it has offered no legal argument explaining how to bridge the conceptual gap between drug trafficking and associated crimes, as serious as they are, and the kind of armed attack to which those terms can legitimately apply.\n\nThe irreversible gravity of killing, coupled with the lack of a substantive legal justification, is bringing into sharper view a structural weakness of law as a check on the American presidency.\n\nIt is becoming clearer than ever that the rule of law in the White House has depended chiefly on norms — on government lawyers willing to raise objections when merited and to resign in protest if ignored, and on presidents who want to appear lawful. This is especially true in an era when party loyalty has defanged the threat of impeachment by Congress, and after the Supreme Court granted presidents immunity from prosecution for crimes committed with official powers.\n\nEvery modern president has occasionally taken some aggressive policy step based on a stretched or disputed legal interpretation. But in the past, they and their aides made a point to develop substantive legal theories and to meet public and congressional expectations to explain why they thought their actions were lawful, even if not everyone agreed.\n\nAround 15 years ago, intense legal controversy surrounded President Barack Obama’s drone strikes targeting Al Qaeda militants in ungoverned places where the United States did not have ground troops, like Yemen and tribal Pakistan. Those included the killing of a U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, who was deemed an operational terrorist leader whose capture was infeasible.\n\nBehind the scenes, Obama administration lawyers wrestled with the scope and limits of how the congressionally authorized armed conflict against Al Qaeda could apply to such scenarios. They developed lengthy and detailed memos citing Supreme Court precedents, and systematically worked through issues of domestic and international law.\n\nThe details of its legal rationale became known to Congress and the public not only through unauthorized disclosures and Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, but also because the administration delivered speeches and produced a white paper summarizing its reasoning, which it gave to Congress.\n\nToday, the Trump administration is mostly behaving with audacious transparency about its boat attacks. Mr. Trump has posted surveillance videos of the deadly strikes, talked with relish about how “it is violent and it is very — it’s amazing, the weaponry,” and even acknowledged that he had authorized the C.I.A. to take covert actions in Venezuela.\n\nBut administration officials have clammed up when asked for the legal analysis to support their assertion that there is a legal state of armed conflict that makes the killings lawful.\n\nEven in closed-door congressional briefings, according to people familiar with them, officials have provided no detailed legal answers. They are said to have cited drug overdose deaths of Americans, and stated that Mr. Trump decided the country was in an armed conflict with drug cartels. They are also said to have pointed to the part of the Constitution that makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces, without much further elaboration.\n\nJack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former top Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said Mr. Trump’s actions demonstrated an indifference to law that threatened to hollow it out.\n\n“Nixon tried to keep his criminality secret, and the Bush administration tried to keep the torture secret, and that secrecy acknowledged the norm that these things were wrong,” Professor Goldsmith said. “Trump, as he often does when he is breaking law or norms, is acting publicly and without shame or unease. This is a very successful way to destroy the efficacy of law and norms.”\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement for this article that Mr. Trump promised during the campaign to take on drug cartels whose actions “resulted in the needless deaths of innocent Americans.” She suggested his “unprecedented action” would continue.\n\n“All of these decisive strikes have been against designated narcoterrorists, as affirmed by U.S. intelligence, bringing deadly poison to our shores, and the president will continue to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice,” she said.\n\nIn peacetime, targeting civilians — even suspected criminals — who pose no threat of imminent violence is considered murder. In an armed conflict, it is a war crime. International law accepted by the U.S. military says that, as do U.S. laws.\n\nBy asserting that he can have the military kill people suspected of drug trafficking as if they are enemy soldiers on a battlefield, Mr. Trump is blurring a line between enforcing the law and waging a war.\n\nThe United States has long dealt with maritime smuggling by using the Coast Guard, sometimes assisted by the Navy, to intercept boats and, if illicit cargo is found, to arrest their crews. Similarly, the police arrest people they believe are dealing drugs; it would be considered murder to instead summarily gun such suspects down in the street. And even if a person accused of drug trafficking pleads guilty or is convicted at trial, the penalty is prison — not execution.\n\nSince Sept. 2, however, the military, on Mr. Trump’s orders, has carried out nine strikes on small vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Colombia. Mr. Trump has asserted that each boat carried drugs that would have killed 25,000 Americans, and on behalf of “narco-terrorists,” or cartels his team has designated as terrorist organizations.\n\nIt is increasingly difficult to speak plainly about the administration’s actions without dissecting layers of rhetoric that can create a misleading impression.\n\nIn all, about 80,000 American drug users died last year by overdosing, down from about 110,000 in 2023. The drug that has caused a surge in such deaths over the past decade is fentanyl, which comes from labs in Mexico. South America, the origin of the boats the Trump administration has been attacking, instead produces cocaine.\n\nAnd terrorists, by definition, are trying to advance some ideological or religious cause. Drug cartels, by contrast, seek to profit from an illicit consumer product. In any case, the law that enables the executive branch to designate a group as terrorists triggers the power to freeze its assets and criminalize providing support to it, not to kill people suspected of membership.\n\nThese factual distinctions raise questions about the two legal terms the administration has invoked to say that its killings are lawful rather than murders: “self-defense” and “armed conflict.”\n\nTo legally kill someone in self-defense, the deadly force must be necessary to prevent an imminent threat of death or significant injury. In an armed conflict, though, one can legally kill someone based on the person’s status as a member of the enemy force, even if that person poses no immediate threat. But for an armed conflict to exist, there must be a certain intensity and duration of combat.\n\nWhy is carrying drugs on a speedboat 1,500 miles from Florida, the kind of vessel the Coast Guard and Navy could easily seize, an imminent threat of death? Why is trafficking cocaine — not fentanyl — an armed attack on the United States? Why does crewing a drug-running boat make someone a targetable combatant rather than a criminal?\n\nWhat is the theory for transmuting acts of crime into acts of war?\n\nLegal deliberations inside the executive branch, according to officials familiar with the matter, have been closely held and largely limited to political appointees. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel — which Mr. Trump sidelined for most of the year until appointing an official to lead it in August as preparations for the attacks ramped up — has produced a memo apparently blessing the campaign. But the administration has not described its analysis.\n\nAn administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, disputed the premise of this article. The administration has, in fact, publicly laid out its legal theory, the official said, pointing to a recent notice to Congress about one of the boat attacks.\n\nThe notice lays out a policy argument for attacking cartels, portraying them as dangerous groups that are “directly” causing the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. And it states that Mr. Trump has “determined” that their actions “constitute an armed attack against the United States” and that the country is in a formal “armed conflict” with them.\n\nBut even putting aside the key factual discrepancy between fentanyl and cocaine for overdose deaths, the notice contains no legal theory. It does not mention international and domestic laws governing force. It does not cite court precedents and analyze how they might apply. It offers no explanation for how Mr. Trump could legitimately “determine” that trafficking drugs is legally an armed attack, giving him the power to lawfully order killings in response.\n\nEven if the Justice Department memo that somehow blesses the killings lacks much actual legal analysis and a future administration rescinds it, its existence essentially forecloses any prospect of future prosecutions. It is hard to prove someone intentionally committed a crime when the Justice Department itself said at the time that the action was lawful.\n\nTwo decades ago, Professor Goldsmith took over the Office of Legal Counsel and withdrew memos issued under the Bush administration that blessed the C.I.A.’s torture program. Reflecting on that period in a memoir, he called such memos get-out-of-jail-free cards.\n\nThe silence about what legal theory can support Mr. Trump’s assertion that suspected drug smugglers are lawful military targets as “combatants” in an armed conflict dovetails with a growing pattern in his administration’s assertions of executive power.\n\nThe administration has found a two-part hack to the system in which executive branch lawyers are supposed to independently determine the legal boundaries within which policymakers may act.\n\nThe first is that Mr. Trump has told executive branch lawyers that they may not question any legal judgment that he — or Attorney General Pam Bondi, subject to his “supervision and control” — already decided. “The president and the attorney general’s opinions on questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties,” Mr. Trump declared in a February executive order.\n\nThe second is that Mr. Trump has been declaring that as president, he has determined that the factual and legal scenarios exist that are necessary for him to exercise various extraordinary powers.\n\nThe two tactics combined create a gigantic loophole. Mr. Trump is able to dictate his own factual and legal realities, and executive branch lawyers who want to keep their jobs must treat them as settled. The result is that Mr. Trump can order agencies to take actions to which independent-minded lawyers might have raised legal objections.\n\nOn his first day in office in January, Mr. Trump signed an order that nullified a law the Supreme Court had just unanimously upheld that banned TikTok from operating in the United States. When letters the Justice Department sent to tech companies assuring them that they could lawfully violate the statute became public in July, they explained only that Mr. Trump had “determined” that the law interfered with his constitutional duties.\n\nEven when Mr. Trump’s “determinations” reach the courts, the administration has argued that judges must defer to Mr. Trump’s assertions, too.\n\nFor example, Mr. Trump is trying to use a wartime deportation law to deport Venezuelan migrants without due process — taking planeloads of them to a notorious Salvadoran prison — based on his assertion that Venezuela’s government is directing a gang to invade the United States.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community believes the gang is not, in fact, controlled by Venezuela’s government, and lower-court judges have rejected his finding that illegal immigration counts as an “invasion.” But the administration has faulted those judges for having “failed to defer to the president’s determinations,” and a full appeals court has decided to rehear the case.\n\nMr. Trump’s attempts to deploy troops under federal control into Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and Chicago also turn on his finding, rejected by lower-court judges, that protests of his immigration crackdown were out of control. One Trump-appointed judge wrote, “The president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts.”\n\nTwo appeals court panels have overturned the rulings about Los Angeles and Portland, saying greater deference was required. A third panel upheld the ruling about Chicago, but the administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene, insisting that courts may not “review the president’s judgment at all.”\n\nPolitically appointed officials have often been ready to devise creative legal theories that allow presidents to do what they want, especially when it comes to war powers. Many critics, for example, said that was the Obama administration’s approach in defending his unilateral decision to have the United States participate in NATO’s 2011 air war in Libya.\n\nStill, the very act of searching for a legal theory and developing an argument can shape deliberations about what a president chooses to do. And sometimes presidents have restrained themselves because of legal objections, as when Mr. Obama relinquished his high-profile vow to close the prison at Guantánamo because of a law barring him from bringing detainees to the United States.\n\nBased on the information now available, Geoffrey S. Corn, a retired judge advocate general officer who served as the Army’s senior law-of-war adviser and now teaches criminal and military law at Texas Tech University, said that the United States was not in an armed conflict with drug cartels, notwithstanding Mr. Trump’s “determination.”\n\nProfessor Corn said he believed the killings were illegal, and expressed concern about “the impact on the morality of the war fighters who have to carry out the orders.”\n\n“The men and women who volunteered to serve this nation and engage in the most morally challenging conduct imaginable — killing someone who is not immediately threatening you — have a right to know the nation will not order them to engage in that deadly endeavor unless it is genuinely justified both legally and morally,” he said. “The service members who conduct attacks have to live the rest of their lives with the memory.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/opinion/crypto-trump-libertarianism-corruption.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:00:28-04:00","title":"How Crypto Corrupted America","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article 'How Crypto Corrupted America' argues that cryptocurrency, initially promoted as a tool for financial freedom and decentralization, has instead become a powerful mechanism for concentrating wealth and political power.

Hundreds gathered at President Trump’s private country club in Virginia in May for a gala evening. Guests included Justin Sun, a cryptocurrency billionaire who, in the Biden administration, was under investigation for suspected financial crimes. He and the other attendees had won their seats by being the top buyers of $TRUMP memecoin, a form of crypto that benefits Mr. Trump’s family.\n\n“There is a lot of common sense in crypto,” said Mr. Trump, as the room was served a meal accompanied by Trump-branded wine and water. “And we’re honored to be working on helping everybody here.” Mr. Sun later expressed gratitude and received an 18-karat-gold Trump Victory Tourbillon watch. And with that, cryptocurrency elided its dark past and ascended to the apex of American power.\n\nCryptocurrency has found its hero in Mr. Trump. And in this unlikely moment of triumph, its most powerful proponent has laid bare the paradox at the heart of this brave new world of “new money.” Crypto was supposed to free us from the chains of government control, but now it is finally revealing what that freedom really means: removing all checks on the power of the wealthy to do what they want, discharged at last from law, supervision and civic obligation — even if the result is autocracy. Mr. Trump, with his thirst for money and power, has in one fell swoop both exposed and embraced the corruption at the heart of digital currencies — a corruption inherited from the libertarian ideals that created them.\n\nLibertarianism — the decades-old American political movement with an obsessive focus on unfettered individualism and free markets — was, for most of our history, a hard sell. With its roots in both 1950s free-market radicalism and 1960s hedonism, it has lurked on the fringes of American political life with something to offend everyone as libertarians advocated the abolition of, among other things, public schools, environmental protections, the police, the age of consent, the U.S. military and the Federal Reserve. The Libertarian Party languished for decades as a clown show where delegates argued against laws banning child labor, racial segregation and driving without seatbelts.\n\nThe movement attracted a diverse crew of antiwar and anti-police activists, gun nuts, anti-tax businessmen, contrarian freethinkers and conspiracy theorists. You may remember Ron Paul with his twinkly grandpa affect, obsession with the gold standard and investment newsletters riddled with racism and homophobia. Karl Hess largely resolved his objection to taxes by conducting his life by barter; Murray Rothbard tried to forge a libertarian alliance partly by supporting Holocaust deniers (despite being Jewish himself). What these intellectuals all shared was a devotion to limiting — or eliminating — the power of the state and replacing it with the power of the market.\n\nMainstream Republican senators and donors dabbled with libertarianism to advance free-market projects but ignored the rest of the program: yes to cutting taxes, no to drug legalization and shutting down the Pentagon. True believers were studiously kept at arm’s length.\n\nLibertarianism was always an elitist movement. Individual liberty and the destruction of the state’s authority would enable a new elite to take power over the population. Ayn Rand was libertarians’ favorite novelist, after all: Her rich, brilliant supermen despise everyone else, and their victory is the freedom to be in charge at last without rules or laws to restrain their self-interest.\n\nIn the 1990s, the internet revolution birthed an obscure technology that seemed almost purpose-built to fulfill a libertarian extremist’s visions: the blockchain. Originally proposed as a way to help authenticate and time-stamp digital data, it offered a way for strangers to maintain a shared digital ledger over the internet. With the blockchain, people could prove ownership of property, transfer or receive online assets and even set up contracts without filing any paperwork, dealing with auditors, banks or regulators, or paying taxes.\n\nThe technology soon attracted a following of libertarians, the most extreme of whom had long dreamed of replacing government-regulated banks with a parallel financial infrastructure for untaxable, untraceable, borderless online-only cash. They used the technology to develop cryptocurrencies, the first of which was Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to quirky, high-minded libertarian intellectuals, crypto also attracted criminals. Libertarian projects seem to invariably attract both. By definition, a libertarian tool is a tool to skirt conventional legality, a challenge to existing laws and their legitimacy.\n\nThe intellectuals had varied goals. Civil liberties activists wanted anonymous payments for political donations and for financially vulnerable industries like sex work. Ultraconservative policy wonks fantasized about replacing America’s central bank, the Federal Reserve. “Anarcho-capitalists” dreamed of a nerd-warlord society of failed states and corporate mercenaries. The criminals just wanted untraceable currency to hide their illegal activities.\n\nI met many folks from all those groups at libertarian events in New Hampshire in the 20-teens. Some were there for a backwoods prepper-pastoral lifestyle of raw milk, unvaccinated kids, fluoride-free water and assault rifles. People sold “End the Fed” bumper stickers and Ayn Rand novels and shirts announcing that “AN ARMED SOCIETY IS A POLITE SOCIETY.” Some were raising money for the legal defense of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the dark web drug marketplace the Silk Road, who had been arrested by the F.B.I. Everybody wanted to talk about crypto over snacks of paleo granola and homemade deer jerky.\n\nThen crypto attracted the attention of a few major Silicon Valley investors. Early to the party was Peter Thiel, an extreme libertarian who has long championed a belief in the limits and failings of democratic institutions. He is almost better known for his wild positions — city-state “seastead” tax havens in international waters, and lamenting women’s suffrage — than for his investing acumen.\n\nMr. Thiel had long suggested that the production of money must be moved from the hands of central banks into the private sector. His original conception of PayPal, which he co-founded in the late 1990s, was intended to fulfill this vision before it eventually morphed into a conventional online payment business.\n\nAnother early crypto adopter was Marc Andreessen, the Netscape co-founder whose work creating the first major web browser played a key role in the internet revolution. Unlike Mr. Thiel, Mr. Andreessen’s political profile was standard Silicon Valley, with a history of donations to Democratic campaigns and vocal advocacy for Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. In early 2014, soon after his firm began investing in crypto, Mr. Andreessen promoted a high-minded vision of crypto to make the world a better place, in which its tools would bring the “roughly 175” countries without fully modern banking and payment systems into the global financial infrastructure.\n\nWhether crypto was intended to replace the bank and its regulator down the street or to build new banking systems thousands of miles away, the goal was the same. Mr. Thiel and Mr. Andreessen had made big bets on creating their own financial system, one that could replace the existing one and earn them enormous returns. Investment in a new technology by a couple of big Silicon Valley names quickly attracted many others who then funded numerous new crypto start-ups.\n\nBoth men focused on the legitimate prospects for cryptocurrency, rather than its deep links to the criminal economy. In 2013, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s analysis estimated that up to 90 percent of Bitcoin transactions that year were primarily used to facilitate illicit activity, including drug sales, blackmail, ransomware and illegal pornography. Many traditional financial leaders were dismissive, as was Donald Trump, who noted during his first presidency that crypto was “highly volatile” and “based on thin air.”\n\nThen came Covid, which led the Federal Reserve to sharply cut interest rates. Venture capitalists took that effectively free money and poured it into the hot new thing. And the more capital that went to funding crypto start-ups, the more that followed — a classic case of “fear of missing out” that can transform a few high-risk investments into a frenzy. The result was a vicious cycle of cash, hype and increasingly unrealistic valuations. A single Bitcoin went from being effectively worthless in 2010 to briefly reaching $69,000 in November of 2021.\n\nThe valuations ballooned, as did the promises about crypto.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s then-chief global strategist suggested in 2020 that crypto could replace the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. Bitcoin was commonly promoted as a form of “digital gold,” a safe harbor from future financial crises. The podcaster Joe Rogan expressed his fear of storing money with traditional banks and his belief that Bitcoin would be the future universal currency.\n\nIn 2021, $33 billion in venture capital was plowed into crypto start-ups, or more than in all previous years combined. Crypto.com paid $700 million to rename Staples Center in Los Angeles and cut an ad with Matt Damon that compared crypto investors to explorers and astronauts.\n\nCriminality continued apace, but millions of Americans also found another use for crypto. “They want to gamble,” says Molly White, an industry researcher and critic, with users rapidly trading various cryptocurrencies to try to gain from their fluctuating values. The pandemic, which spurred an explosion in online speculation of all sorts, rendered currencies so volatile that they couldn’t fulfill Mr. Andreessen’s goal of serving as the financial backbone of developing nations. There was also essentially nobody to hold anyone accountable for falsifying results, for Ponzi schemes, for money laundering or for “rug pulls” — hyping a new crypto to naïve investors, only to disappear with the cash once enough people had bought in.\n\nBy the end of 2022, FTX, an industry leader, was bankrupt and its founder and chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, arrested, with a conviction and prison sentence coming later. Changpeng Zhao, then the chief executive of the rival Binance, was also sent to prison. His firm was fined $4 billion for profiting from countless scams and crimes — helping ransomware hackers and child abuse sites handle their payments, for example — and enabling financial transactions and money laundering for sanctioned entities like the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and North Korea.\n\nThe Biden administration’s efforts to rein in the sector were underway. But they were characteristic of the downsides of the Biden era: inconsistent, confusing and cautious. “Pause letters” called on firms to hold off on projects that did not seem to violate any rules, and executives testified about businesses bogged down by rapidly changing federal regulatory demands. Some crypto firms and their founders found themselves cut off from banking services — which is usually an emergency measure for dangerously risky or potentially criminal clients — without clear explanations or recourse.\n\nThe result of all this was numerous bankruptcies of crypto companies and waves of layoffs. Bitcoin’s value plummeted. While the wild volatility, speculative fever, criminal activity and collapse of major exchanges could be reasonably understood as contributing to the industry’s doldrums, crypto’s most committed investors almost exclusively blamed Mr. Biden for their problems. Mr. Andreessen — whose firm currently has about $7.6 billion invested in crypto, or roughly 10 percent of its total capital under management — became convinced that the Biden administration was trying to kill crypto entirely.\n\nWealthy crypto investors turned to the other guy. Crypto offered Mr. Trump not just the promise of generous political donations at a time when fund-raising for his 2024 presidential campaign was struggling, but it could also potentially deliver a demographic of young male crypto fans. Mr. Trump changed his tune.\n\nMr. Trump chose Senator JD Vance of Ohio — Mr. Thiel’s longtime protégé — as his running mate and headlined the Bitcoin conference in Nashville two weeks later. “The rules,” Mr. Trump announced, “will be written by people who love your industry.” Mr. Andreessen, who supported Democratic candidates in prior election cycles, backed Mr. Trump’s campaign. In all, the crypto industry would become the dominant corporate donor in 2024, putting in over $130 million; a vast majority of all industry donations to the presidential race were to the Trump-Vance ticket.\n\nAlong with money, Mr. Trump’s commitment to crypto got him a new voting bloc whose interests were straightforward. Some 50 million people owned crypto in 2024, according to one research firm, and Mr. Trump had a 12-point lead among that group in the months before the election, according to Fairleigh Dickinson University polling — a lead that was not connected with Republican Party membership.\n\nMr. Trump won. Almost immediately after taking office, he ushered crypto’s biggest backers into the highest echelons of power. David Sacks, a close associate of Mr. Thiel, was appointed “A.I. and crypto czar,” tasked with designing the new regulatory framework for the industry. Associates of Mr. Thiel and Mr. Andreessen are now peppered throughout the administration.\n\nThe administration then set about destroying Biden-era efforts to control crypto. Many regulations, investigations and enforcement cases against the industry have been rolled back or dropped. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which had sought oversight of crypto payments to address scam and fraud complaints, was ordered to halt activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Assets and Cyber unit was rebranded into a smaller and more industry-friendly team.\n\nMr. Trump pardoned crypto executives and even a corporation — a first. When he made good on a campaign promise and pardoned Mr. Ulbricht, the black market platform chief, the moment was hailed by the Libertarian Party as “an incredible moment in Libertarian history.”\n\nWith regulators defanged and oversight gone, Mr. Trump and a handful of tech backers have been able to seize power and merge their interests with the country’s resources as they see fit.\n\nOver the past nine months, Mr. Trump has turned crypto into an efficient and powerful cash-in machine to grow the family fortune. Remember Mr. Sun, the gala attendee? In addition to the roughly $15 million he spent on $TRUMP, which secured that gala ticket, he has spent at least $75 million on tokens and investments tied to World Liberty Financial, a crypto-finance company mostly owned by the Trump family. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s suit against Mr. Sun has been dropped, and the S.E.C. ceased its investigation into a set of businesses connected with him. And on Thursday, Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Zhao, the ex-Binance chief. He and Binance have, like Mr. Sun, been highly supportive of World Liberty. If the Trumps are willing to make deals, there is little to stop crypto’s biggest backers from getting anything they want.\n\nFlush with money from the now-powerful crypto lobby, Congress and the administration have already passed one law allowing private companies to issue their own crypto and are considering another that would forever bar the government from issuing digital currency itself, ensuring there would be no free government alternative to the for-profit platforms and the tokens Silicon Valley controls. The result could well be a permanent private replacement of the existing financial system — the ideal outcome for a crypto venture investor. If price is any indicator, confidence in crypto is near an all-time high: a single Bitcoin is now worth nearly $110,000.\n\nPresident Trump has always approached politics as a branch of business, a way to capture wealth, status and power. But it took someone with his instincts to fulfill the darkest potential of the libertarian project. Mr. Trump seems to have understood something that escaped generations of libertarian politicians and philosophers: Rather than dissolving the power of the state totally, he could do so selectively, to put himself and his allies above the law, while using the full force of the state to punish his adversaries; to promote crypto, while also insisting he be in charge of the Fed; to pardon allies, while having his enemies charged.\n\nFor Silicon Valley’s crypto backers, there never was a paradox. “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” Mr. Thiel wrote in 2009. He argues that individual freedom can best exist in a society controlled by an elite of innovator-entrepreneur monopolists, whose command of money seemingly gives them command of everything else.\n\nPalantir, a data-mining company that Mr. Thiel co-founded, is thriving amid a flush of government contracts — contracts for a system that helps conduct mass surveillance on U.S. citizens, including facilitating ICE’s raids and roundups. During Mr. Trump’s second term, Palantir has thus far received over $113 million in federal funding and landed a $1.3 billion contract from the Department of Defense.\n\nAnd Mr. Andreessen may have once spoken eloquently about the democratizing and empowering promise of the internet. But it was a full year before the 2024 election when he, too, publicly embraced authoritarianism, advocating in his “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” a society dominated by the “techno-capital machine.” A year later, in an interview conducted a month after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Andreessen referenced the author of the “iron law of oligarchy,” which argues that a small minority always winds up governing society, and declared that “democracy is never actually a thing.”\n\nMr. Trump and his Silicon Valley backers may have taken different journeys to get to their embrace of crypto, but they have ended up in the same place: The government, and the population, exists to serve the interests of their businesses, their enrichment, and their aggrandizement. So the trick of libertarianism wasn’t on them. It was on us.\n\nFor decades, libertarians tried to sell us on wild notions like ending the public school system, abolishing the police, ripping up all environmental protection, canceling the Federal Reserve. None of those notions succeeded, perhaps because they attacked real-world institutions that we understand. It took an obscure technology, fueled by the Silicon Valley hype machine, mountains of dirty money and a massive gambling boom, to persuade millions of voters to embrace an extreme vision of individual freedom and decentralized money — and somehow overlook the authoritarianism and criminality that accompanied it all along.\n\nCrypto is the most successful libertarian project in American history. A technology developed to escape the state is now at the political center of a global superpower. Crypto has become a machine for transferring control and wealth from the many to the few, a bribery-as-a-service platform for buying and selling influence among authoritarian oligarchs. It’s the perfect technological expression of the Trump moment: our country’s crypto era.\n\nFinn Brunton is a professor of science and technology studies at the University of California-Davis and the author of “Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists, Utopians, and Technologists Who Created Cryptocurrency.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

You can check your voter registration status here.\n\nRegistered voters can cast mail-in ballots early, but they must apply in time. The last day to apply online or by mail is on Oct. 25. You can also apply in person at your county board of elections through Monday, Nov. 3.\n\nIf you requested a mail ballot, you can drop off your completed ballot at any early voting site while the polls are open.\n\nPolling places will be open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 4, and voters who are in line when polls close will have the right to vote. Be sure to look up your voting location online.\n\nSeven candidates will be on the ballot for mayor. The top three contenders, who have taken part in both mayoral debates, are Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblyman and the Democratic nominee; former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, an independent candidate running on a ballot line called Fight and Deliver; and Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels subway patrol group and the Republican nominee.\n\nMr. Mamdani will also be on the ballot as the Working Families Party’s nominee, and Mr. Sliwa is also running on a ballot line called Protect Animals.\n\nTwo independent candidates who suspended their campaigns in September, Mayor Eric Adams and Jim Walden, a lawyer, remain on the ballot. The remaining two candidates, Irene Estrada and Joseph Hernandez, have raised little money and did not qualify for the debates.\n\nVoters across the city will also choose candidates for public advocate and city comptroller. There are contested races for all five borough president seats, and all 51 City Council seats will be on the ballot, though in some districts candidates are running unopposed.\n\nIn Manhattan, voters will choose a district attorney. The Democratic incumbent, Alvin L. Bragg, is running against Maud Maron, the Republican candidate and a conservative activist, and Diana Florence, a veteran of the Manhattan district attorney’s office who is running as an independent candidate.\n\nIn Brooklyn, the incumbent district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, is running unopposed.\n\nIn some areas, voters will also be asked to vote for judicial seats.\n\nRaces will vary based on where you live. You can enter your address here to find out which candidates will be on your ballot.\n\nThere are six! The first, a statewide measure, would effectively amend the state constitution to allow the expansion of a winter-sports complex in Lake Placid. If approved, the measure would also require the state to buy at least 2,500 acres to add to protected land in Adirondack Park, where the facility is located.\n\nThe next three measures all pertain to housing in New York City, and they have been at the center of a showdown between the City Council and City Hall. On their face, the proposals, which were written by a Charter Revision Commission created by Mayor Adams, are meant to make it easier to build affordable housing. But the Council has argued that they are intended to curb council members’ influence over new developments in their districts.\n\nThe fifth question would consolidate the official city map. Currently, each borough maintains its own sets of maps.\n\nThe final question would clear the way for city elections to move to even-numbered years, putting them on the same schedule as presidential elections. They are currently held in odd-numbered years.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/briefing/so-long-east-wing.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:06:13-04:00","title":"So Long, East Wing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The East Wing of the White House, which had stood for 123 years and served as a key site for state dinners, the residence of first ladies, and a wartime shelter, was demolished under President Donald Trump’s orders to make room for a $300 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom.

the entrance to the White House for millions of Americans on official tours, the site of offices for every first lady for nearly half a century and the home of calligraphers who prepared thousands of invitations for White House state dinners, disappeared into a pile of rubble yesterday. It had stood for 123 years.\n\nBuilt during the Theodore Roosevelt administration as an entryway for guests arriving in carriages, and rebuilt during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, the East Wing met its end under orders from Trump. He dismissed it this week as “a very small building” that was in the way of his planned 90,000-square-foot, $300 million ballroom. With it went the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and the East Colonnade, which connected the East Wing to the White House and included the president’s theater. “It’s not just a building,” said Laura Schwartz, the White House director of events in the Clinton administration. “It’s the living history.”\n\nTearing down the East Wing to make space for the ballroom was an unfortunate necessity, said Gahl Hodges Burt, who was social secretary for three years under President Ronald Reagan. Since the largest spaces in the building have room for 200 seated guests at most, recent administrations have erected enormous tents on the South Lawn for ever larger state dinners.\n\n“Putting up a tent does nothing but make people upset that they’ve come to a state dinner but they never get inside the White House,” Burt said. “The only bathroom facilities for a tent are porta-potties. Setting up a kitchen out there is hugely expensive. When the tent is up, the helicopter can’t land. And the grass dies.” (Ms. Burt was referring to the presidential helicopter, Marine One.)\n\nMichael LaRosa, the press secretary to Jill Biden, lamented the loss but agreed that a ballroom was needed: “The French have the Élysée Palace, and here we are having a lawn party.”\n\nDuring its 123 years, two modern East Wing incidents stand out.\n\nIn 2009, in what passed as a scandal at the time, two uninvited guests and aspiring television reality stars, Michaele and Tareq Salahi, slipped into the first state dinner of the Obama administration. They rubbed shoulders with Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, Secret Service agents grabbed Vice President Dick Cheney from his West Wing office and rushed him into a bunker below the East Wing, which had been built as a shelter for Roosevelt during World War II. Cheney headed underground the moment that American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.\n\nThe East Wing never had the political importance or cachet of the West Wing, which houses the Oval Office. But it became prominent, and controversial, when Republicans denounced the expensive new construction, built partly to cover Roosevelt’s new underground shelter, as wasteful.\n\nThe personality of the East Wing was always calmer and less intense than that of the testosterone-filled West Wing. Until Thursday, the ground floor housed the White House visitors’ office and the Office of Legislative Affairs, while the second floor was home to the White House Military Office and the offices of the first lady.\n\nPresidents watched the Super Bowl and showed movies before their release in the theater in the colonnade, which was used as a coat check for big events. During holiday parties, a band would often play Christmas carols just outside the East Wing entrance as guests arrived.\n\nMelania Trump visited the East Wing so infrequently during her husband’s first term that her empty office there was converted into a gift-wrapping room. It is unclear how many times she has been there in the second term, or if she had offered any feedback on her husband’s plans.\n\nThe White House released a list of donors who are helping Trump pay for the $300 million ballroom he wants to build at the White House.\n\n“The Daily” podcast today is about the demolition.\n\nOn late night, Stephen Colbert talked about the demolition.\n\nThey’re two of the oldest scams in gambling: Rigging a card game and rigging a ball game. Yesterday, federal officials charged dozens of people — including two active N.B.A. figures and several reputed mobsters — in schemes to carry out both.\n\nBut these scams were anything but old-fashioned. Each used high-tech methods that wouldn’t have been possible a few years ago, according to officials.\n\nThe poker scheme: Officials said four New York Mafia families — the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese families — set up poker nights that swindled millions of dollars from unwitting players. Chauncey Billups, the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, was charged with playing the role of a “face card,” taking part in the games to attract high rollers.\n\nIn some of the rigged games, the poker chip trays had hidden cameras that could read the cards on the table. Sometimes, the cards had markings visible only to people wearing specially designed contact lenses or sunglasses, officials said.\n\nThe organizers are also accused of using a card-shuffling machine that could read the cards in the deck and predict which player had the best hand. That information would then make its way back to the table, through a relay of insiders who communicated with cellphones and secret signals.\n\nThe basketball scheme: With online betting, prop bets allow individual wagers on nearly every player and every statistic. Now players don’t need to throw a game to make gamblers rich. They just need to miss a shot — or take a seat on the bench.\n\nIn March 2023, the indictment says, the veteran guard Terry Rozier told an associate that he planned to pull himself out of a game in the first quarter, citing an injury. Word spread among a group of bettors, who placed hundreds of thousands of dollars of bets on Rozier to under-deliver that night. The bets on his points, assists and 3-point totals paid out — and the gamblers split the proceeds with Rozier, prosecutors said.\n\nBillups and Rozier were arrested yesterday morning. The N.B.A. placed them on leave from their teams.\n\nDamon Jones, a former player and coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers, was also charged in both schemes. He is accused of sharing inside information about one player who is unnamed in the indictment. The Athletic reports it was LeBron James.\n\nThe poker indictment added to New York’s rich lineage of mob nicknames. This time, they include “Flappy,” “The Wrestler” and “Juice.”\n\nTrump called off plans to send federal agents into San Francisco. He wrote on social media that “friends” had asked him to reconsider, citing Marc Benioff, the C.E.O. of Salesforce.\n\nWho are the federal forces on the street? And what powers do they have? These graphics explain.\n\nA protester in Washington D.C. is suing National Guard members and police officers, saying they wrongfully arrested him for playing the “Imperial March” from “Star Wars.”\n\nTrump said he would bypass Congress and expand his military operation against drug cartels, which has killed at least 37 people in nine airstrikes at sea.\n\nSoon after the U.S. began blowing up boats in the Caribbean, unidentified bodies with burn marks and missing limbs started washing up in Trinidad.\n\nVladimir Putin called Trump’s new oil sanctions “an unfriendly act” and warned of an overwhelming response if Ukraine were to get the powerful missiles it seeks.\n\nThe administration says it will allow oil and gas drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of the largest tracts of pristine wilderness left in the country.\n\nTrump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to money laundering and has done business with the Trump family’s crypto operation.\n\nVirginia Democrats plan to redraw House maps, which could give them three extra seats. It’s the latest front in a national redistricting battle.\n\nFour family members of a Republican candidate for Illinois governor, Darren Bailey, died in a helicopter crash.\n\nMayor Eric Adams endorsed Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayor’s race, casting aside months of bitterness.\n\nKim Kardashian says that she has been diagnosed with a brain aneurysm.\n\nThe highest-ranking prelate of the Anglican Church in North America, a conservative breakaway from the Episcopal Church, faces accusations of sexual harassment, plagiarism and bullying from former employees.\n\nThe man accused of starting the Palisades fire in Los Angeles, which burned more than 23,000 acres and killed 12 people, pleaded not guilty.\n\nIceland lost the distinction of being one of the last places in the world without a confirmed sighting of wild mosquitoes. A bug enthusiast found three.\n\nAmericans are thrilled with the Louvre heist. It’s because we need a story to escape into, Sloane Crosley writes.\n\nThe 2025 World Series will be the last with only human umpires. Savor it, Jane Leavy writes.\n\nThe Chinese dream once followed a simple formula: move to a big city, work hard, and buy a home. But China’s economy is suffering. Young people are struggling to find the kind of lucrative office jobs that were once common after college, and some are rejecting the pressure to pursue prosperity at all costs. Meanwhile, the population is aging, and blue-collar jobs are becoming increasingly attractive.\n\nIn response, many workers are finding new careers in the digital gig economy — and in the process, redefining what work looks like. The New York Times profiled some of these workers: a mother helping people navigate China’s bureaucratic hospital system; a lifestyle influencer who urges people to “lie flat” and live affordable, stress-free lives; and a former retail manager who quit her office job to become a licensed electrician.\n\nTree pits: Your dog might be peeing on some of New York’s best folk art.\n\nYour pick: The most-clicked link in The Morning yesterday was about Sabrina Carpenter’s embroidered shirt.\n\n“Tainted Love”: Dave Ball, one half of the English synth-pop duo Soft Cell, died at 66. His bandmate Marc Almond found him, Ball said, because he “heard me making bleepy noises on a synthesizer.”\n\nM.L.B.: The World Series kicks off tonight, with the Toronto Blue Jays taking on the Los Angeles Dodgers. Here are our experts’ predictions.\n\nOlympics: Winter Olympic hopefuls have spent the past few months training on roller-skis, water-ramps, airbags — anything but snow — during the offseason. See how Team USA does it.\n\n“Almost all of American history is division,” the documentarian Ken Burns said recently. That’s true today, of course, but it was also true during the Revolutionary War — an era that has taken on a sentimentality that often strips it of nuance.\n\nBurns’s new project, “The American Revolution,” set to air on PBS next month, aims to strip away the nostalgia. His team drew on two dozen historical consultants, and their differing views appear onscreen not as an argument, Jennifer Schuessler writes, “but as a kind of chorus — a reminder that the Revolution meant, and still means, different things to different people.”\n\nSmother chicken in gravy.\n\nChoose the right running shoes for you.\n\nTake our news quiz.\n\nHere is today’s Spelling Bee.
