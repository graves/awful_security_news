administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism\n\nUnited States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has partially walked back his  warning  that taking Tylenol during pregnancy is directly linked to autism in children.\n\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Kennedy struck a more moderate tone than he generally has in his past public appearances.\n\n“The causative association between Tylenol given in pregnancy and the perinatal periods is not sufficient to say it definitely causes autism,” Kennedy told reporters. “But it’s very suggestive.”\n\n“There should be a cautious approach to it,” he added. “ That’s why our message to patients, to mothers, to people who are pregnant and to the mothers of young children is: Consult your physician.”\n\nWednesday’s statement is closer in line with the guidance of  reputable health agencies .\n\nWhile some studies have raised the possibility of a link between Tylenol and autism, there have been no conclusive findings. Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"02:12:47+00:00","title":"California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate conference in Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the Trump administration’s absence from the event as a failure of leadership and a betrayal of U.S. climate responsibility.

2025-11-12T02:12:47+00:00\n\nTitle: California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/india-arrests-kashmir-resident-over-deadly-delhi-car-blast","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"15:38:30+00:00","title":"India arrests Kashmir resident over deadly Delhi car blast","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car bomb explosion in New Delhi, killing 12 and injuring 32, has prompted the arrest of Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Pampore in Indian-administered Kashmir, as an accomplice to suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi.

of US military bases to tackle drug violence\n\nEcuadoreans are voting on whether to lift a constitutional ban on foreign military bases as right-wing  President Daniel Noboa  pushes for help from the United States in confronting spiralling drug-fuelled violence.\n\nNearly 14 million people cast ballots on Sunday in a referendum that also asks whether to reduce the number of lawmakers.\n\nThe vote comes as Ecuador grapples with unprecedented bloodshed, with the country’s homicide rate projected to hit 50 per 100,000 people this year, the highest in Latin America.\n\nPolls suggest more than 61 percent of voters back allowing foreign bases, which would likely see the US return to the Manta airbase on the Pacific coast.\n\nUS forces operated from Manta between 1999 and 2009 as part of anti-narcotics efforts, until leftist President Rafael Correa held a referendum on foreign troops, resulting in their constitutional ban.\n\nEcuador, once considered one of the more stable countries in the region, has in recent years faced a sharp rise in violence, with drug cartels, including powerful ones from Mexico, exploiting porous borders and weak institutions to expand their influence.\n\nNoboa, a 37-year-old heir to a prominent banana-exporting fortune, who took office in November 2023, has responded with militarised crackdowns, deployed soldiers to the streets and prisons, launched raids on gang strongholds, declared states of emergency and tightened security at key infrastructure hubs.\n\nThe first half of this year saw 4,619 murders, the highest on record, according to Ecuador’s Organized Crime Observatory.\n\nAs voting opened, Noboa announced the capture in Spain of Wilmer Geovanny Chavarria Barre, known as Pipo, leader of the notorious Los Lobos gang, who had faked his death and fled to Europe.\n\nHe was arrested in the Spanish city of Malaga after Ecuadorean authorities worked with their Spanish counterparts to track him down.\n\nInterior Minister John Reimberg linked Chavarria to more than 400 killings and said he had run criminal networks from behind bars for eight years until 2019.\n\nNoboa said the Los Lobos chief had overseen illicit mining schemes and maintained trafficking connections with Mexico’s Jalisco New Generation Cartel, all whilst hiding in Europe under a false identity.\n\nThe US  designated  Los Lobos and Los Choneros, another Ecuadorian crime syndicate, as “terrorist” organisations in September.\n\nCritics question whether military force alone can address the crisis.\n\nFormer President Correa has described the return of foreign forces as “an insult to our public forces and an assault to our sovereignty”, adding: “We do not need foreign soldiers. We need government.”\n\nThe referendum also includes questions on a constituent assembly that opposition groups fear could allow Noboa to consolidate power.\n\nIn August, Noboa led a demonstration against Constitutional Court justices, with officials calling them “enemies of the people” after they limited expansive security laws.\n\nCritics of the president also argue that a constitutional rewrite will not solve problems like insecurity and poor access to health and education services.\n\nEcuador became a major cocaine transit hub after the 2016 peace deal in Colombia demobilised guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), with international trafficking organisations quickly filling the void.\n\nThe country’s Pacific ports, proximity to coca-producing Peru and Colombia, and weak institutions have made it central to the global cocaine supply chain.\n\nNoboa, who survived an attack in October when his car was surrounded by protesters and struck by bullets, has compared his security approach to that of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, posting images of shaven-headed inmates in orange uniforms at a new mega-prison."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/skateboarding-helps-gaza-children-with-trauma-amid-ruins-adds-rare-joy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:14:41Z","title":"Skateboarding helps Gaza children with trauma amid ruins, adds rare joy","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the ruins of Gaza, a mobile skateboarding initiative provides vital mental health support to traumatized children, offering them a rare sense of normalcy, recreation, and joy amid ongoing violence and displacement.

displacement camps in  Gaza  is providing rare mental health support to children trapped in one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises, where trauma and grief are rife.\n\nAmid the wreckage of Gaza City, where collapsed buildings and twisted concrete dominate the landscape, a group of young Palestinians has transformed the destruction into an unlikely playground.\n\nSince the fragile ceasefire began on October 10, skateboard coaches have been running sessions that offer traumatised children brief moments of freedom and normalcy.\n\n“We used to have skateparks in the Gaza Strip; this was our dream here in Gaza,” said Rajab al-Reifi, one of the coaches working with the children. “But unfortunately, after we finally achieved that dream and built skateparks, the war came and destroyed everything.”\n\nThe skateboarding initiative operates against a backdrop of  continuing Israeli violence  despite the ceasefire.\n\nIsraeli forces have killed at least 260 Palestinians and wounded 632 others since the truce began on October 10, with attacks occurring on 25 of the past 31 days.\n\nThe sessions face severe challenges.\n\nWith equipment shortages across Gaza, every skateboard wheel and piece of wood has become precious. Al-Reifi often repairs damaged boards between sessions, knowing replacements are nearly impossible to obtain.\n\nOne of the few flat courtyards to survive Israel’s bombardment provides a training ground for beginners, while more adventurous skaters have turned piles of rubble and collapsed walls into makeshift ramps and obstacles.\n\nRimas Dalloul, another dedicated coach, works to keep the children engaged despite the dire conditions.\n\n“We don’t have enough skateboards for everyone, and there is no protective gear,” she explained. “Their clothes are all they have to help cushion them when they fall. They get injured sometimes, but they always come back. The desire to play is stronger than the pain.”\n\nAmong the young skaters is seven-year-old Marah Salem, who has been practicing for seven months.\n\n“I come here to have fun. I don’t want to skip any sessions; I want to be consistent,” she said. “Even during the war, I used to skateboard. I used to run away from the bombardment to skate on the streets.”\n\nHer determination reflects a broader resilience among Gaza’s children, who have endured nearly two years of Israeli military assault.\n\nThe skateboarding sessions offer children a form of recreation and a temporary escape, but also a means to process trauma and a communal activity.\n\nThe mental health needs of Gaza’s children remain staggering.\n\nHumanitarian organisations had already identified more than one million Palestinian children in need of mental health services before the latest conflict intensified.\n\nThe scale of the conflict means no child has been shielded from its psychological impact, with mass displacement, family separations, and widespread casualties affecting the entire young population.\n\nAt least 17,000 children are now  unaccompanied or separated  from their parents, while child protection cases surged by 48 percent in September alone, the International Rescue Committee reports.\n\nFor the young skaters, the sessions offer something that war has tried to take away, the simple freedom of childhood play.\n\nTheir schools have been decimated, their homes destroyed, and more than 658,000 school-age children have lost access to education for nearly two years.\n\nYet in the ruins of their neighbourhoods, these children are finding ways to move forward.\n\nThey are simply kids on skateboards, laughing, falling, getting back up, and pushing forward – both literally and metaphorically – through the rubble of their shattered world."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/chile-votes-for-new-president-in-communist-vs-far-right-contest","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:06:24+00:00","title":"Chile votes for new president in communist vs far-right contest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chile is holding a pivotal election in which over 15 million voters will choose a new president and Congress, with the outcome potentially shifting the country from its center-left course to a far-right one.

marched through the streets of the Brazilian city of Belem, calling for the  voices of Indigenous peoples  and environmental defenders to be heard at the United Nations COP30 climate summit.\n\nIndigenous community members mixed with activists at Saturday’s march, which unfolded in a festive atmosphere as participants carried a giant beach ball representing the Earth and a Brazilian flag emblazoned with the words “Protected Amazon”.\n\nIt was the first major protest outside the conference, which began earlier this week in Belem, bringing together world leaders, activists and experts in a push to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIndigenous activists previously  stormed the summit , disrupting the proceedings as they demanded that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva take concrete action to ensure their territories are protected from growing threats.\n\nAmnesty International warned in a recent report that  billions of people  around the world are threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel projects, such as oil-and-gas pipelines and coal mines.\n\nIndigenous communities , in particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make our voices heard from  the Amazon  and demand results,” he said. “We need more Indigenous representatives at COP to defend our rights.”\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help  poorer countries adapt to climate change."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31Z","title":"Solar

hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds.

The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/israel-pushes-us-to-close-door-on-palestinian-statehood-before-un-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:21:54+00:00","title":"Israel pushes US to close door on Palestinian statehood before UNSC vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel is engaged in a final diplomatic effort to prevent the United Nations Security Council from endorsing a resolution that would support a 'credible pathway' to Palestinian statehood under the second phase of Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan.

Potential contributors to the force have indicated that a UN mandate is essential for their participation.\n\nIsrael has already said it will not accept Turkiye, a key Gaza ceasefire mediator,  having any role  on the ground.\n\nTurkiye has maintained staunch criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza over the past two years and recently issued  arrest warrants for genocide  against Netanyahu and other senior officials.\n\nAhead of Monday’s crucial vote, which is expected to garner the nine votes needed to pass, with the likely abstention of Russia and China, Netanyahu confidants and officials from the Foreign Ministry were said to be engaged in intensive talks with their US counterparts, according to the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (Kan).\n\nA far-right walkout over the ceasefire plan, in which Trump has heavily invested his own prestige, could bring down Netanyahu’s right-wing government well before the next election, which must be held by October 2026.\n\nOn Sunday, Israeli government officials lined up to express their opposition to any proposals backing a Palestinian state.\n\n“Israel’s policy is clear: no Palestinian state will be established,” Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X.\n\nHe was followed by Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, who said on X that his country would “not agree to the establishment of a Palestinian terror state in the heart of the Land of Israel”.\n\nFar-right firebrand and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called the Palestinian identity an “invention”.\n\nHardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a major backer of Israel’s settler movement who has been  sanctioned  by a number of countries for “incitement of violence” against Palestinians, urged Netanyahu to take action.\n\n“Formulate immediately an appropriate and decisive response that will make it clear to the entire world – no Palestinian state will ever arise on the lands of our homeland,” he said on X.\n\nThe UNSC resolution would give the UN’s blessing to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point plan, which brought about a ceasefire after two years of genocidal war that has killed nearly 70,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe ceasefire came into effect on October 10, although it has been repeatedly  breached  by Israel with near-daily attacks that have killed hundreds of people.\n\nThere has been plenty of jockeying ahead of the vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia is circulating its own  resolution  to rival the US version, offering stronger language on Palestinian statehood and stressing that the occupied West Bank and Gaza must be joined as a contiguous state under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn a statement, Russia’s UN mission said that its objective was to “to amend the US concept and bring it into conformity” with previous UNSC decisions.\n\n“We would like to stress that our document does not contradict the American initiative,” said the statement. “On the contrary, it notes the tireless efforts by the mediators – the United States, Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye – without which the long-awaited ceasefire and the release of hostages and detainees would have been impossible.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak that began in October 2024, resulting in 5,000 cases and two deaths.

2025-11-11T14:15:46+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a dire water crisis exacerbated by six consecutive years of drought, extreme heatwaves, and inadequate water management.

with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02+00:00","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan is facing a sharp increase in bear attacks since April 2025, with at least 13 deaths and over 100 injuries recorded—the highest toll since 2006.

2025-11-14T14:32:02+00:00\n\nTitle: What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/us-lawmaker-marjorie-taylor-greene-blames-trump-for-threats-after-split","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:04:29+00:00","title":"US lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene blames Trump for threats after split","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican U.S. representative from Georgia, claims that President Donald Trump's online attacks have triggered a wave of threats against her, citing historical patterns where aggressive rhetoric leads to radicalized individuals targeting those under attack.

Greene blames Trump for threats after split\n\nRepublican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene has accused United States President Donald Trump of putting her life in danger, saying his online criticism has triggered a wave of threats against her.\n\nGreene, once a longtime Trump loyalist who has more recently taken positions at odds with the president, on Saturday said she has been contacted by private security firms warning about her safety.\n\n“Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalised by the same type [of] rhetoric being directed at me right now,” Greene, a House of Representatives member from Georgia, posted on X.\n\n“This time by the President of the United States.”\n\nThe White House has not yet responded to her post.\n\nTrump  broke off  with Greene, 51, on Friday night in a withering social media post, in which he referred to Greene as “wacky” and a “ranting lunatic” who complained he would not take her calls.\n\nHe continued his criticism on Saturday with two more social media posts, calling her a “lightweight Congresswoman”, a “traitor”, and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party.\n\nIn her first response posted on Friday, Greene accused Trump of lying about her and trying to intimidate other Republicans before a House of Representatives  vote  next week on releasing files related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child sex offender who was friendly with Trump in the 1990s and 2000s before they had a falling out.\n\nOn Saturday, Greene wrote that she now has a “small understanding” of the fear and pressure felt by the victims of Epstein, who died by suicide in a jail cell in 2019.\n\n“As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump’s bills and agenda, his aggression against me which also fuels the venomous nature of his radical internet trolls [many of whom are paid], this is completely shocking to everyone,” she wrote.\n\nOn Wednesday, Greene was one of only four House Republicans who joined Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote on releasing the full Justice Department files related to Epstein, as the scandal once again ensnares Trump.\n\nThe US president has called the furore over Epstein a “hoax” pushed by the Democrats.\n\nHe suggested in his Truth Social post that conservative voters in Greene’s district might consider a primary challenger and that he would support the right candidate against her in next year’s congressional election.\n\nOnline backlash from Trump supporters is not unusual. Right-wing influencers and conservative media personalities have become a potent online force in amplifying talking points and false claims, and attempting to discredit Trump’s rivals."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/syria-detains-members-of-security-forces-over-suwayda-violence","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:53:03+00:00","title":"Syria detains members of security forces over Suwayda violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Syria has detained members of its security and military services following a violent sectarian conflict in the Druze-majority province of Suwayda in July, where hundreds of civilians were killed.

into sectarian violence in the southern province of  Suwayda  earlier this year that left hundreds dead.\n\nJudge Hatem Naasan, head of a committee investigating the eruption of violence in Suwayda in July, said that members of security services and the military “who were proven to have committed violations” based on findings and videos posted online had been detained.\n\n“Videos posted on social media clearly showed faces, and they were detained by the authorities concerned,” Naasan said, adding that security personnel were detained by the Interior Ministry while members of the military are being held by the Defence Ministry.\n\nVideos that surfaced online had shown armed men killing Druze civilians kneeling in public squares and shaving the moustaches off elderly men in an act of humiliation.\n\nNaasan did not specify how many arrests were made. Nor did he announce a death toll, saying this would come in the final report that is expected by the end of the year.\n\nHe acknowledged that “some foreign fighters randomly and individually entered the city of Suwayda”, saying that some had been detained and questioned. He stated that none of them were members of the Syrian armed or security forces.\n\nFighting broke out  in the  Druze-majority province  after a Druze truck driver was abducted on a public highway, drawing in Bedouin tribal fighters from other parts of the country.\n\nGovernment forces were deployed to restore order, but were accused of siding with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters.\n\nA  ceasefire  was established after a week of violence.\n\nClaiming that it was protecting the Druze, Israel also intervened, launching dozens of air attacks on government forces in Suwayda and even striking the Syrian Ministry of Defence headquarters in the centre of the capital Damascus.\n\nIsrael has carried out hundreds of air strikes around the country since the end of the 54-year al-Assad dynasty in December, mainly targeting, it says, assets of the Syrian army, but also carrying out incursions.\n\nAfter the acts of violence in July, many in Suwayda now want some form of autonomy in a federal system. A smaller group is calling for total partition.\n\nPresident Ahmed al-Sharaa has been painstakingly trying to usher Syria back into the international fold, with notable successes. In September, he was the first Syrian leader to address the United Nations General Assembly in six decades, and he  was invited to the White House  on Monday for a second meeting with United States President Donald Trump.\n\nAl-Sharaa, who wants to unify his war-ravaged nation and end its decades of international isolation, was the first-ever Syrian leader to visit the White House since the country’s independence in 1946.\n\nBoth the US and European Union have dropped sanctions against Syria, and major Gulf Arab investment is giving the war-devastated nation a critical economic lifeline.\n\nBut al-Sharaa’s quest for national unity after a 14-year ruinous civil war still faces major internal and external challenges ahead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/somalia-confirms-major-data-breach-in-electronic-visa-system","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"17:17:10Z","title":"Somalia confirms major data breach in electronic visa system","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Somalia’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency confirmed a major data breach in its electronic visa system, exposing personal data of at least 35,000 travellers, including thousands of American citizens.

breach in electronic visa system\n\nSomalia’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency has confirmed that hackers breached its electronic visa platform, exposing sensitive personal data of travellers who used the system.\n\nThe admission on Sunday marks the first official acknowledgement by Somali authorities after the United States and United Kingdom issued warnings earlier in the week.\n\nAt least 35,000 people, including thousands of American citizens, may have had their data compromised when “ unidentified hackers ” penetrated the system, according to a US Embassy statement issued on November 13.\n\nSomalia’s Defence Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi had praised the electronic visa system this week, claiming it had successfully prevented ISIL (ISIS) fighters from entering the country, as a  months-long battle  continued in the northern regions against a local affiliate of the group.\n\nThe leak came to wider attention last week after clusters of accounts on the social media platform X began circulating what they claimed was personal information from affected individuals.\n\nThe breach has cast a spotlight on the vulnerabilities of a digital system that Somalia’s government had promoted as essential for improving national security.\n\nThe immigration agency said it was treating the issue with “special importance” and announced it has launched an investigation into the issue.\n\nThe agency said it was investigating “the extent of the attempted breach, its origin, and any potential impact”, adding that a report would be published and those affected would be informed directly.\n\nHowever, the statement did not indicate how many people were affected, nor did it give any sense of how long the process might take.\n\nThe government has since quietly moved its e-visa system to a new website.\n\nThe UK embassy warned travellers on November 14 that “this data breach is ongoing and could expose any personal data you enter into the system,” advising people to “consider the risks before applying for an e-visa”.\n\nMohamed Ibrahim, a former Somali telecommunications minister and tech expert, told Al Jazeera that while hacking is a significant challenge, the authorities’ lack of transparency is troubling.\n\n“Somalia isn’t high-tech, and hacking, in itself, is neither here nor there. But they should have been upfront with the public,” Ibrahim said.\n\n“Why was the website’s URL changed, for example? That hasn’t even been explained,” he added, referring to the domain name change for the e-visa application site.\n\nOn Saturday, the Somali immigration agency’s director-general dismissed media reports about the breach as “coordinated misinformation campaigns” intended to undermine state institutions.\n\n“A Somali individual cannot undermine the dignity, authority, honour or unity of the state,” Mustafa Sheikh Ali Duhulow told an audience in Mogadishu on Saturday night, without directly addressing the hacking allegations.\n\nThe breach has sparked fury among officials in Somaliland, the breakaway region that declared independence from Somalia in 1991, who have generally resisted attempts by Mogadishu to impose control over the territory.\n\nMohamed Hagi, an adviser to Somaliland’s president, called Mogadishu’s administration “institutionally irresponsible” for keeping the visa portal active despite the breach.\n\nThe incident came amid escalating tensions between Somalia and Somaliland over airspace control.\n\nSomalia’s government has been working to tighten control of its national airspace and centralise visa procedures, despite authority in the country being fragmented among autonomous regional states.\n\nJust one day before the breach emerged, Somaliland declared that “entry visas issued by the Federal Government of Somalia bear no legal validity” within its territory."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/iran-says-no-prospect-of-talks-as-west-builds-pressure-over-nuclear-issue","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"14:06:30+00:00","title":"Iran says no prospect of talks as West builds pressure over nuclear issue","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iranian officials assert that the United States and its allies, including France, the UK, and Germany, are pursuing a forceful and maximalist approach to Iran’s nuclear programme, making diplomatic negotiations highly unlikely.

trying to mediate and keep the peace.

Iran’s envoy to Vienna, where the nuclear watchdog is based, was joined on Friday by counterparts from China and Russia in a meeting with the representatives of the United Nations agency.\n\n“There’s no enrichment right now because our nuclear enrichment facilities have been attacked,” the foreign minister said at the news conference. “Our message is clear: Iran’s right for peaceful use of nuclear energy, including enrichment, is undeniable, and we will continue to exercise it.”\n\nLast week, the latest IAEA confidential report on Iran’s nuclear programme was leaked to Western media, which reported that the UN agency has not been able to verify Iran’s stockpile of 60 percent-enriched uranium since its facilities were  bombed and severely damaged  by the US and Israel in June.\n\nThe IAEA said it needed “long overdue” inspections of seven of the sites targeted during the war, including Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nIran has granted the IAEA access to the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant and the Tehran Research Reactor but has said security and safety conditions have not been met for inspections at other facilities as the high-enriched uranium stays buried.\n\nIranian officials signalled over the weekend that three European powers – France, the United Kingdom and Germany – which were part of the country’s  now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal  with world powers, may be mobilising to introduce another Iran-focused resolution to the IAEA’s board.\n\nIran responded to several previous censure resolutions with escalations in uranium enrichment, and Israel launched its June attacks on Iran a day after the IAEA  passed a European-tabled resolution  that found Tehran noncompliant with its nuclear safeguards commitments.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Tehran on Sunday, the deputy for international and legal affairs in Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kazem Gharibabadi, said Iran “reserves the right to reconsider its approaches” if a new resolution moves through.\n\nHe said the three European countries’ effort was a US-backed move to  reinstate UN sanctions  against Iran despite strong opposition from China and Russia last month and it “eliminated them from the field of dialogue and diplomacy with Iran”.\n\n“Another resolution will bear no additional pressure on Iran, but the message it will send shows that collaboration and coordination are not important to them,” Gharibabadi said.\n\nIran’s nuclear programme chief, Mohammad Eslami, also slammed the West and the IAEA, telling reporters on Sunday that the UN agency is  being used for political purposes , which “enforces double standards and a law of the jungle that must be stopped”.\n\n“The attacks on Iran’s facilities were unprecedented. It was the first time that nuclear facilities under agency supervision were attacked, which meant a violation of international law, but the IAEA did not condemn the attacks,” Eslami said.\n\nIran’s military commanders continue to signal defiance as well. Defence Minister Amir Hatami told a meeting of lawmakers on Sunday that armed forces have been “sparing no moment in improving defence capabilities” after the 12-day war with Israel.\n\nTensions remain high in the region after the war with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on Saturday confirming that it  seized a Cyprus-registered tanker  that transited through the Strait of Hormuz."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/un-peacekeepers-say-israeli-forces-fired-on-them-in-southern-lebanon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:53:06+00:00","title":"UN peacekeepers say Israeli forces fire on them in southern Lebanon","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reports that Israeli forces fired on UN peacekeepers from a Merkava tank in southern Lebanon, violating a year-long ceasefire and UN Security Council Resolution 1701.

Israeli soldiers have shot at its peacekeepers in their latest targeting of UNIFIL as Israel continues to attack Lebanon on a near-daily basis in violation of a yearlong ceasefire in its war against Hezbollah.\n\nIsraeli forces on Sunday “fired on UNIFIL peacekeepers from a Merkava tank from near a position Israel has established in Lebanese territory”, the peacekeepers said in a statement, adding heavy-machinegun rounds hit about 5 metres (5.5 yards) from their personnel.\n\nUNIFIL said the peacekeepers were able to leave safely 30 minutes later after the tank withdrew inside the Israeli position.\n\nIsrael said its soldiers who fired at UNIFIL did so due to “poor weather conditions” and mistook the UN patrol for “suspects”.\n\nThe Lebanese army also issued a statement: “The army command affirms that it is working in coordination with friendly countries to put an end to the ongoing violations and breaches by the Israeli enemy, which require immediate action as they represent a dangerous escalation.”\n\nIn September, UNIFIL said Israeli drones had  dropped four grenades  close to its peacekeepers in southern Lebanon with one landing within 20 metres (22 yards) of UN personnel and vehicles.\n\nUNIFIL said the shooting “represents a serious violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701”, which ended a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and also formed the basis of the November 2024 truce.\n\n“Yet again, we call on the [Israeli military] to cease any aggressive behavior and attacks on or near peacekeepers,” UNIFIL said on Sunday.\n\nUNIFIL has been working with the Lebanese army to maintain the truce between Israel and Hezbollah, which brought an end to intensive hostilities that erupted into full-blown war after the start of the Gaza war in October 2023.\n\nIsrael killed more than 4,000 people, mostly civilians, in its recent war on Lebanon and displaced more than a million people. It razed dozens of villages and occupied – and still  refuses to withdraw  from – at least five points on Lebanese territory as stipulated under the deal.\n\nIsrael said its strikes on Lebanon target Hezbollah sites and fighters but has not provided any evidence.\n\nOn Saturday, the National News Agency, the official news agency of the Lebanese government, reported that Lebanon plans to file a complaint with the UN Security Council over Israel’s construction of a concrete wall along its southern border that traverses the “Blue Line”, a 120km (75-mile) unofficial border drawn up by the UN between Lebanon and Israel.\n\nAccording to the news agency, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun requested the complaint be issued along with  recent UN reports confirming  the Israeli wall has blocked off about 4,000sq metres (43,055sq ft) of territory to Lebanese people.\n\nThe Blue Line’s main purpose is to confirm the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Lebanese territory as mandated by UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nUNIFIL on Friday said the “Israeli presence and construction in Lebanese territory are violations of Security Council Resolution 1701 and of Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.\n\n“We again call on the [Israeli military] to respect the Blue Line in its full length and withdraw from all areas north of it,” it added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/why-are-biologic-drugs-expensive-will-trumps-plans-make-them-cheaper","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"12:37:26+00:00","title":"Why are biologic drugs expensive?

2025-11-16T12:37:26+00:00\n\nTitle: Why are biologic drugs expensive? Will Trump’s plans make them cheaper?\n\nLowering the prices of prescription drugs has been high on United States President Donald Trump’s agenda since he took office in January. He has taken a number of steps, including striking deals with pharmaceutical companies, to lower the costs of prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also directed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to streamline its regulation process to boost cheaper copycat drugs, such as generic and biosimilar drugs.\n\nBiosimilars are highly similar versions of biologics, a group of drugs produced through biological processes. One of the most widely used biologic drugs is insulin, which is used to treat diabetes.\n\nB iologics, which make up just 5 percent of prescriptions, account for more than half of the total expenditures on medicines in the US, according to the health data analysis company IQVIA.\n\nThe Trump administration said it hopes to make these medications more  affordable , partly by increasing access to biosimilars.\n\nSo what are biologics and biosimilars, and will the administration’s proposals help drive down their  costs ?\n\nBiologics is short for biological medications or products. It’s a broad category of products that include vaccines, blood and blood components, gene therapy and tissues. They are a class of complex drugs produced through biological processes or from living organisms, such as proteins and genes. They treat cancer, autoimmune diseases and other rare disorders.\n\nBiologics are typically administered by injection or through an intravenous infusion, said Alex Keeton, executive director of the Biosimilars Council at the Association for Accessible Medicines, an industry group that advocates on behalf of biosimilar manufacturers.\n\nThe FDA approval process for these products is rigorous and typically takes 10 to 15 years, said Brian Chen, a University of South Carolina health law and economics expert. Speedier timelines are possible in extraordinary circumstances: Federal agencies worked with vaccine manufacturers and scientists to expedite  COVID-19  vaccines, for example.\n\nAs the name suggests, these medications are similar to the original biologics approved by the FDA. Biosimilars are developed and sold after the original biologic has lost its patent exclusivity, Keeton said. Biosimilars for Humira, a drug used by people with rheumatoid arthritis, include Cyltezo, Amjevita and Idacio.\n\n“They still work the same way clinically, but they’re not exactly the same,” Keeton said.\n\nThat’s because, unlike with generic versions of brand name drugs, it’s impossible to make exact copies of biologics. Biologics have complicated production processes and their components are derived from live organisms.\n\n“Biologics are like strands of flexible, cooked spaghetti folded in very specific ways, making exact replication nearly impossible,” Chen said.\n\nThe FDA evaluates proposed biosimilar products against the original biologic to determine whether the product is extremely similar and has no meaningful clinical differences. It is expected to have the same benefits and risks as the original biologic. To be approved, biosimilar manufacturers must show patients using their products don’t have new or worsening side effects compared with patients using the original biologic.\n\nFDA approval for biosimilars often takes five to six years, Keeton said.\n\nBiosimilars  increase market competition , incentivising brand name drug manufacturers to lower their prices.\n\nThey’re pricey, and exact costs vary.\n\nOne 2018 study found that biologics and biosimilars can cost a US patient $10,000 to $30,000 each year on average.\n\nHumira is more. It was listed at $6,922 for a month’s supply in early November. The Humira biosimilar Cyltezo advertises for 5 percent off Humira’s cost. The makers of Cyltezo also offer a non-brand name option for people who pay cash at pharmacies while using the GoodRx app at a price of $550.\n\nThe actual amount insured patients pay also depends on their plan and their insurer’s negotiated rates.\n\nBiosimilar prices typically run 15 percent to 35 percent lower than their brand name biologic counterparts, one 2024 study found. The FDA found biologics produce a more dramatic cost savings of 50 percent on average.\n\nBiologics and biosimilars are difficult to develop and produce, which adds to their expense.\n\nMaking a standard over-the-counter medication such as aspirin requires five ingredients. Making insulin, a biologic, requires genetic modifications to living organisms.\n\nThese complex manufacturing procedures and proprietary information make it difficult for competitors to create alternatives.\n\nTo put this in perspective, there were 226 marketed biologics in the US as of July, and the FDA had approved 76 biosimilars such as insulin. When it comes to non-biologic medications, the FDA has approved more than 32,000 generic drugs. That’s more than the number of approved brand name drugs.\n\nYes. All biosimilars must meet FDA requirements and must be highly similar and have no clinically meaningful differences from their existing FDA-approved biologic counterpart.\n\nUnder its draft guidance, the administration proposed reducing some of the tests required as part of the FDA process used to prove a biosimilar drug is as safe and effective as its biologic counterpart.\n\nCurrently, a manufacturer requesting a biosimilar licence has to provide clinical study data proving its product’s similarity. The FDA’s new proposal would no longer require drug developers to conduct these comparative clinical trials.\n\nManufacturers would still be required to test proposed biosimilars. Other data – including comparative analysis, immune response data and human study data showing how the drug moves through the body – could sufficiently demonstrate the drug’s similarity to an existing biologic, the FDA said.\n\nUltimately, the agency said it aims to incentivise drug manufacturers to quickly develop biosimilars by eliminating redundant, costly and time-consuming clinical studies, Keeton said.\n\nSaving that time might increase the number of biosimilar alternatives.\n\nIt would almost certainly lower the front-end development costs for drugmakers, Chen said.\n\nRegulatory changes alone may not significantly drive down prices for many Americans.\n\nSeveral non-brand name options need to be available to produce significant price  drops , according to a US Department of Health and Human Services report.\n\nBut prices could remain the same even with more options.\n\nA 2024 study in the JAMA Health Forum, a health policy journal, found that annual out-of-pocket costs either increased or remained stable for most biologics even after biosimilars were available. Patients who used biosimilars didn’t pay less than those who used the original biologics.\n\nThat’s at least partly because biologic manufacturers often offer substantial rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, companies that work with insurers, employers and others to manage prescription drug plan benefits. In exchange, insurers give the name brand biologics preferred or exclusive placement on their lists of insurance-covered drugs, Chen said. Rebate walls ultimately prevent the sale of cheaper biosimilars, he said.\n\nYes, another key hurdle remains: Name brand biologic manufacturers often hold many patents and file lawsuits blocking approved biosimilars from being commercially marketed.\n\nA 2018 study conducted by Chen found that of 12 FDA-approved biosimilar products, five were commercially available as of October 2018. Six others were unavailable because of patent disputes.\n\nPolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/zelenskyy-says-ukraine-working-on-new-prisoner-exchange-with-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"15:09:43+00:00","title":"Zelenskyy says Ukraine working on new prisoner exchange with Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine is actively pursuing a prisoner exchange with Russia to return around 1,200 detained Ukrainians, facilitated by negotiations mediated by Turkey and the United Arab Emirates under the 2022 Istanbul agreements.

Since then, Russia and Ukraine have traded thousands of prisoners although the exchanges have been sporadic.\n\nBut the swaps have been the only progress of any note in talks between the two sides as the war rages on and another punishing winter approaches with oil and energy sites being targeted by both Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nAuthorities in Moscow did not immediately comment on the issue.\n\nUmerov said technical consultations would be held soon to finalise procedural and organisational details, expressing hope that returning Ukrainians could “celebrate the New Year and Christmas holidays at home – at the family table and next to their relatives”.\n\nMeanwhile, Finnish President Alexander Stubb told The Associated Press news agency that a ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal that has engulfed Kyiv.\n\nEurope, meanwhile, will require “sisu”, a Finnish word meaning endurance, resilience and grit, to get through the winter, he said, as Russia continues its hybrid attacks and information war across the continent.\n\n“I’m not very optimistic about achieving a ceasefire or the beginning of peace negotiations, at least this year,” Stubb said, commenting that it would be good to “get something going” by March.\n\nIn other developments, energy infrastructure was damaged by Russian drone strikes overnight into Sunday in Ukraine’s Odesa region, the State Emergency Service said. A solar power plant was among the damaged sites.\n\nUkraine is desperately  trying to fend off  relentless Russian aerial attacks that have brought rolling blackouts across Ukraine on the brink of winter.\n\nCombined missile and drone strikes on the power grid have coincided with Ukraine’s efforts to hold back a Russian battlefield push aimed at capturing the eastern stronghold of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.\n\nRussia launched 176 drones and fired one missile overnight, Ukraine’s air force said on Sunday, adding that Ukrainian forces shot down or neutralised 139 drones.\n\nUkrainian forces  struck  a major oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region along with a warehouse storing drones for the elite Rubicon drone unit in partially Russian-occupied Donetsk, Ukraine’s general staff said on Sunday. Russian officials did not immediately confirm the attacks.\n\nMonths of long-range Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian refineries are aimed at depriving Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue  the war .\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that its forces shot down 57 Ukrainian drones overnight.\n\nIt also said its troops had captured the settlements of Mala Tokmachka and Rivnopillya in eastern Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure, has died at the age of 97.

DNA double helix, dies at 97\n\nScientist James Watson, whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/whats-grokipedia-musks-ai-powered-rival-to-wikipedia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:10:15+00:00","title":"What’s Grokipedia, Musk’s AI-powered rival to Wikipedia?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elon Musk launched Grokipedia in October 2025 as an AI-powered rival to Wikipedia, claiming it would surpass Wikipedia in accuracy and depth.

AI-powered rival to Wikipedia?\n\nLast month, tech billionaire Elon Musk launched Grokipedia, an AI-powered platform, to rival online encyclopedia Wikipedia.\n\n“Grokipedia will exceed Wikipedia by several orders of magnitude in breadth, depth and accuracy,” Musk posted on X the day after his site went live on October 27.\n\nIn the age of generative artificial intelligence and AI-assisted search engines, Wikipedia remains an information repository authored by humans.\n\nGrokipedia will exceed Wikipedia by several orders of magnitude in breadth, depth and accuracy  https://t.co/Nt4M6vqEZu\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)  October 28, 2025\n\nYet PolitiFact found Grokipedia’s articles are often almost entirely lifted from Wikipedia. And when the entries differ, Grokipedia’s information quality and sourcing are problematic and error-prone, making it a less reliable research tool.\n\nMusk said on an October 31 episode of the “All-In” tech and business podcast that his team instructed his company’s chatbot,  Grok , to go through the top 1 million Wikipedia articles and then “add, modify and delete”.\n\n“So that means research the rest of the internet, whatever is publicly available, and correct the Wikipedia articles, fix mistakes, but also add a lot more context,” he said on the podcast.\n\nGrokipedia articles often contain the text “Fact-checked by  Grok “.\n\nPolitiFact reviewed Grokipedia articles and found that when they include language that’s different from what appeared on Wikipedia, the new content:\n\nGrokipedia often also removes context from its articles.\n\nA sample of Grokipedia’s 885,279 articles reveals they are subject to a similar AI-related phenomenon we first saw in May, prior to the tool’s unveiling. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr then released a Make America Healthy Again report that contained several erroneous citations, including crediting sources that did not exist.\n\nJoseph Reagle, Northeastern University associate professor of communication studies, said Grokipedia misunderstands Wikipedia’s and AI’s strengths.\n\n“Wikipedia’s merits are that it is the result of a community of thousands of people diligently working to create high-quality content,” Reagle said, while AI is useful when it’s interactive and accepts pushback.\n\nHundreds of thousands of volunteers worldwide contribute content to Wikipedia, guided by the platform’s editorial policies and guidelines.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that operates Wikipedia, is aware of Grokipedia’s copying problem.\n\n“Even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist,” said Selena Decklemann, chief product and technology officer at the Wikimedia Foundation, in a statement to PolitiFact. “Wikipedia’s content is open source by design; we expect it will be used in good faith to educate. This issue is especially urgent as platforms like Grokipedia increasingly draw on our articles, selectively extracting content – written by thousands of volunteers – and filtering it through opaque and unaccountable algorithms.”\n\nWe looked at Grokipedia articles covering various topics including science, music and economics. In many articles we reviewed, Grokipedia links to Wikipedia articles with this statement: “The content is adapted from Wikipedia, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License.”\n\nThat means Wikipedia’s licensing allows Grokipedia to copy, redistribute and adapt the content with an attribution. It also requires Grokipedia to give the same permissions for its adapted content. (There are some articles that don’t copy from Wikipedia and don’t feature this statement, such as the article for Joseph Stalin.)\n\nGrokipedia’s article structure is similar to Wikipedia’s, which features reference lists at the bottom. But in some instances, Grokipedia copies Wikipedia articles while omitting their citations and reference lists.\n\nGrokipedia’s article for “Monday,” for example, includes information about the day of the week’s etymology, related religious observances and cultural references. But it contains no citations other than to say it was adapted from Wikipedia.\n\nThe Grokipedia article was a 96 percent match of Wikipedia’s “Monday” article, according to Copyscape, a plagiarism checker. The Wikipedia article, however, listed 22 references.\n\nSometimes Grokipedia botches citations. In the entry for “culminating point,” Grokipedia cited the wrong book chapter in which military theorist Carl von Clausewitz introduced the concept. The rest of the article text is copied from Wikipedia.\n\nOne article that differs significantly from its Wikipedia counterpart is the entry for “Hello”, a song by British singer Adele. Multiple items in the Grokipedia reference list are Instagram reels that provide secondhand, unattributed information and commentary. Wikipedia’s standards say such user-generated content is “generally unacceptable as sources”.\n\nIn the entry for the Canadian singer Feist, Grokipedia copied from Wikipedia but added a line saying her father died in May 2021. The citation led to Vice’s 2017 ranking of the 60 best Canadian indie rock songs, an article that doesn’t mention the death of Feist’s father, who was still alive that year.\n\nPolitiFact found at least one instance when Grokipedia introduced  misleading  information.\n\nThe Grokipedia and Wikipedia articles for “Nobel Prize in Physics” are largely the same, but one sentence Grokipedia added said, “Physics is traditionally the first award presented in the Nobel Prize ceremony.” It did not provide a citation, and it appears to be wrong: In at least the past few years, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded first.\n\n“Unlike Grokipedia, which relies on rapid AI-generated content with limited transparency and oversight, Wikipedia’s processes are open to public review and rigorously document the sources behind every article,” Decklemann said.\n\nWikipedia allows anyone to contribute and edit articles, and ensures transparency by making the history of an article viewable. Some volunteers have advanced permissions and are equipped to address negative behaviour on the platform.\n\nHowever, Wikipedia has come under scrutiny after an editor  blocked changes  to an article on the Gaza genocide page.\n\nOn Grokipedia, registered users can suggest edits to published articles. But Grokipedia has no feature allowing readers to view what edits have been made. It is unclear what happens when there are  errors  – whether a human or Grok corrects them, how those changes are deliberated, and how long it takes to update pages.\n\nPolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/whats-the-shadowy-organisation-taking-gaza-palestinians-to-south-africa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:18:48Z","title":"What’s the shadowy organisation taking Gaza Palestinians to South Africa?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A chartered flight carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza, many without proper travel documents, landed in Johannesburg, South Africa, leaving officials baffled.

Africa?\n\nOn Thursday morning, a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from war-torn Gaza – many without the required travel documents – landed at an airport near Johannesburg, leaving South African officials “blindsided”.\n\nAfter nearly 12 hours of scrambling, the group was allowed to disembark into the care of a local charity organisation.\n\nMore details have emerged about the scheme run by “Al-Majd Europe”, through which activists argue Israel is advancing its ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian passengers were charged a hefty sum of money by the organisation, which says on its website that it coordinates “evacuations from conflict zones”.\n\nHere is everything we know about the group’s transit so far and who’s behind Al-Majd Europe.\n\nThe plane full of people sat on a runway for nearly 12 hours while South African authorities tried to figure out why they did not have exit stamps or slips from when they left Gaza, according to officials from South Africa’s border agency.\n\nThey were also not sure when asked by immigration where they would stay or how long they planned to be in South Africa.\n\nThe government allowed them to leave the plane after charity organisation Gift of the Givers offered to accommodate them.\n\nOfficials said 23 Palestinians flew to other countries, without adding any more details.\n\n“These are people from Gaza who somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi and came here,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Friday.\n\nHe added that “it does seem like they were being flushed out” of Gaza. South Africa’s intelligence services are investigating the incident.\n\nBehind the flight is Al-Majd Europe, which is accused of acting in coordination with Israeli authorities.\n\nLoay Abu Saif, who fled Gaza with his wife and children to Johannesburg, told Al Jazeera on Friday that he had heard about it through a social media advertisement.\n\nThe Al-Majd Europe website says it was founded in 2010 in Germany, and the homepage has a pop-up warning about individuals pretending to be its agents, sharing phone numbers of “legitimate representatives”.\n\nBut the site itself has no address or phone number, providing just a location in  Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem. However, Al Jazeera was not able to find an office there.\n\nThe website domain, almajdeurope.org, was only registered in February this year, while several links on the site lead nowhere. The email listed, info@almajdeurope.org, bounces back an automated message saying it does not exist.\n\nNamecheap, which registered the domain, has been cited in several cybersecurity reports on online fraud because of its low-cost, easy sign-up process.\n\nAl Jazeera learned that many people were told to pay via bank transfers to personal, not organisational, accounts.\n\nAmong the links that work is a page with four “Impact Stories”.\n\nOne post about “Mona”, a 29-year-old from Aleppo, Syria, is dated March 22, 2023, even though the website was only registered 10 months later.\n\nThe narrative, written in “Mona’s” voice, expresses gratitude to Al-Majd for moving her and her mother “to a safe place” when they felt threatened in Lebanon, where they fled to in 2013.\n\nThe photo, however, shows Abeer Khayat, who was 33 when photographed by journalist Madeline Edwards in December 2024 in Tripoli, Lebanon, for Middle East Eye.\n\nThe online form reads: “For Gaza residents currently inside the Gaza Strip only!\n\n“Do you aspire to travel and start a new life? We are here to help you!”\n\nThe Palestinian families, with a pregnant woman among them, boarded the plane not knowing their final destination, having paid Al-Majd $1,400 to $2,000 each – the price for children the same as adults.\n\nSaif, who was on the plane, said he hadn’t known when they would leave Gaza until a day before, when he was told passengers could only take a small bag, a mobile phone, and some cash.\n\nThey were taken by bus from southern Gaza’s Rafah to the Karem Abu Salem crossing (known as Kerem Shalom in Israel), where they were checked, then transferred to Israel’s Ramon Airport, without Israeli authorities stamping their travel documents.\n\nAnother person interviewed by Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity said: “The … applicant must [have a young] family. [Then] the names are sent for security screening. Once that’s completed, and if the family is approved, they’re asked to pay,” he said.\n\n“There had been prior coordination with the Israeli army for the buses to enter Rafah,” he said. “The process was only routine.”\n\nThe group left from Ramon in a Romanian aircraft and transited through Nairobi, Kenya, before landing in Johannesburg.\n\nA man who was on board the plane told Al Jazeera there had been a similar flight to Indonesia in June.\n\nAl-Majd’s website also claims to have facilitated a trip for “a group of doctors working in hospitals in the Gaza Strip” who it flew to Indonesia “for further studies and advanced medical training”. However, this post is dated April 28, 2024.\n\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify the authenticity of this post and a photograph of the group in it.\n\nGift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman, who alleged that Al-Majd was one of “Israel’s front organisations”, told AP that this was the second plane to arrive in South Africa.\n\nAnother plane arrived with more than 170 Palestinians on board on October 28, but that flight was not announced by authorities.\n\nThe Palestinian Embassy in South Africa said in a statement that the flight was arranged by “an unregistered and misleading organization that exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner”.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Palestinians, especially those in the Gaza Strip, about networks that seek to remove them from their homes in line with Israeli interests."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/who-is-marjorie-taylor-greene-trumps-maga-ally-turned-critic","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"17:09:55+00:00","title":"Who is Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump’s MAGA ally turned critic?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative from Georgia, was once a leading voice in Donald Trump’s MAGA movement, but has since become a vocal critic of his policies.

Taylor Greene, Trump’s MAGA ally turned critic?\n\nShe was one of the staunchest supporters of Donald Trump, amplifying the America First agenda of his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, but Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has had a public falling-out with the United States president.\n\nGreene, one of the most vocal voices from Trump’s MAGA base, has increasingly been  expressing her disagreements , accusing the Trump administration of prioritising foreign policy over pressing domestic issues, such as a cost-of-living crisis. She has particularly been critical of US military support for Israel’s war on Gaza, which she has  called a genocide .\n\nBut the breakdown of their relationship came after Greene backed Democratic efforts to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was a friend of Trump’s.\n\nOn Friday, Trump announced he was revoking his endorsement of Greene as he used his Truth Social platform to  call  the 51-year-old lawmaker “wacky” and a “ranting lunatic”. A day later, he continued his broadside, calling her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party.\n\nIn response, Greene said Trump is coming after her “hard”, seeking to “scare all the other Republicans before next week’s vote to release the Epstein files”.\n\nOn Saturday, the Republican lawmaker  accused  Trump of putting her life in danger, saying his online criticism has triggered a wave of threats against her.\n\nSo who is Greene, and why has her relationship with Trump broken down? How will it impact the MAGA base?\n\nGreene’s interest in politics,  according to  the US broadcaster NBC News, began in 2016, when she began writing on topics supporting the far-right  QAnon conspiracy theories .\n\nShe was elected to represent Georgia’s 14th Congressional District in 2020.\n\nAs a member of the US House of Representatives since January 2021, Greene has been a staunch Trump supporter and also stood by the president during the  January 2021 Capitol Hill insurrection , which saw Trump supporters force their way into the US Capitol building to try to stop the certification of the presidential election victory of Trump rival and Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nGreene said “January 6 was just a riot” and defended it as a movement to “overthrow tyrants”. But after a backlash, she said she had been joking.\n\nGreene has been a vocal supporter of the conservative agenda in the US, calling herself anti-abortion, pro-gun and anti-immigration. She has backed the US building walls along its borders to prevent undocumented immigrants from entering the country.\n\nBorn Marjorie Taylor in Milledgeville, Georgia, in 1974, Greene graduated from the University of Georgia in 1996 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.\n\nShe then began working in her family’s company Taylor Commercial, a construction and renovation company, and in 2002, she and her husband at the time, Perry Greene, took over the business. In 2012, Marjorie entered the fitness sector and opened a CrossFit gym that she expanded and eventually sold.\n\nIn recent weeks, Greene has been critical of the US president’s policies, especially linked to the Epstein files, the cost of living crisis, healthcare and foreign policy.\n\nEpstein files : On Wednesday, US lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate, putting Trump’s relationship with the sex offender under scrutiny.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in prison in 2019 after being arrested on charges of sex trafficking of minors. Trump, who had a 15-year friendship with Epstein, denies all wrongdoing and has repeatedly stated that he was never involved in – or even knew about – Epstein’s sexual crimes.\n\nBut the US Department of Justice has repeatedly refused to release the court files, raising eyebrows – not least among Trump’s own Republican Party and MAGA base.\n\nGreene has been critical of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files and has repeatedly said all the files should be released.\n\n“The American people deserve full transparency into who was involved in these horrific acts,” she said on X on Thursday.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on releasing all remaining sealed court files pertaining to Epstein this week.\n\nCost of living:  In recent weeks, Greene has railed against Trump’s budget and spending policies and also accused Republicans of not paying enough attention to the cost of living crisis.\n\nSince Trump returned to the White House in January, he has insisted that he would bring prices down in the US by bringing in more revenue to the government by imposing tariffs. He has also repeatedly  said  inflation is not currently a serious concern for the US economy.\n\nAccording to  the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of September, grocery prices have risen every month since Trump took office.  According to  the US Energy Information Administration, the price of electricity bills has also risen.\n\nIn an  interview  with former Trump Press Secretary Sean Spencer on Friday, Greene said: “President Trump and his administration [do] deserve a lot of credit for lowering inflation and holding it steady, but that doesn’t bring prices down. And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping.”\n\n“It’s actually infuriating people because people know what they’re paying at the grocery store. They know what they’re paying for their kid’s clothes and school supplies. They know what they’re paying for their electricity bills,” she said.\n\nHealthcare costs : Greene has also accused Republicans of failing to grapple with rising healthcare costs, expressing her concerns about the issue as the government shutdown, the longest in US history, ended without a guarantee on tax credits for health insurance.\n\nDemocrats have proposed a bill for a three-year extension of the healthcare subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of this year.\n\n“When the tax credits expire this year, my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district,” she wrote in an X post on October 7.\n\n“Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” she added.\n\nTrump has proposed to send healthcare subsidies directly into people’s bank accounts.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly prioritised the interests of American citizens by promising more jobs and bringing down the cost of living.\n\nBut according to Greene, the president has not devoted time on domestic issues. She has been critical of US military support to Israel and became one of the first Republicans to call Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide.\n\nShe publicly took on Trump for military intervention in Iran in support of Israel.\n\nGreene has also been opposed to the Trump administration sending more weapons to Ukraine as Europe’s deadliest war since World War II rages on. In July after Trump approved more military support to Kyiv, Greene, said on X: “MAGA voted for no more US involvement in foreign wars.”\n\nIn August, she also expressed dissent against the Trump administration’s $20bn economic support to Argentina, accusing the government of ignoring its America First agenda.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News this month, she said: “We didn’t elect the president to go out there and travel the world and end the foreign wars.”\n\n“We elected the president to stop sending tax dollars and weapons for the foreign wars – to completely not engage any more,” she said, addeding: “One of the big campaign issues is Americans were fed up with foreign wars.”\n\nAnnouncing that he is withdrawing his endorsement of Greene in a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said all he sees “‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!”\n\n“She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore,” Trump said.\n\n“I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”\n\nHe also said she should not run for governor or senator of Georgia and accused Greene of going “far left” in her views.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Trump also defended his MAGA strategy and said MAGA was his idea. “I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else.”\n\nOn social media after the release of the Epstein files on Wednesday, he said it was a “hoax” by Democrats and said “a very bad or stupid Republican would fall into that trap.”\n\nResponding to Trump’s attack late on Friday, Greene said on X that she’s astonished about how hard Trump’s fighting “to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level”.\n\n“But really most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream,” she said, adding that’s what she voted for.\n\n“I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,” she said.\n\n“But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.”\n\nPresident Trump just attacked me and lied about me. I haven’t called him at all, but I did send these text messages today. Apparently this is what sent him over the edge.\n\nThe Epstein files.\n\nAnd of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other…  pic.twitter.com/EcUzaohZZs\n\n— Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG)  November 15, 2025\n\nMany MAGA supporters have expressed their support to Greene after Trump’s attack against her.\n\n“I respect President Trump but I stand with my Congresswoman @mtgreenee,”  said  Emory Roy, who works for Turning Point Action, the organisation founded by Trump supporter Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed in September.\n\n“While we are seeing progress under President Trump’s Administration, I know the people of NWGA [Northwest Georgia] will stop at nothing until we get back to the founding principles that made this country so great,” she added.\n\nSome MAGA users also began expressing their discontent with Trump after the feud.\n\n“I voted for Trump three times and I regret it. I will not be voting for him in the midterms. I hope he loses,” one X user  said  on Saturday.\n\nAnother X user shared a similar view and  said : “He’s lost his way from maga.”\n\nGreene has been a controversial figure, known for a combative style of dealing with politicians as well as journalists.\n\nShe told a journalist to “f*** off” during an interview last year. After then-British Foreign Secretary David Cameron urged the US to back Ukraine, Greene said: “David Cameron needs to worry about his own country and, frankly, he can kiss my a**.”\n\nGreene has faced criticism for her support for QAnon before being elected to Congress in 2020, even though she insists she has distanced herself from the ideology.\n\nOne of her theories included the claim that 9/11 was an inside job and there is no evidence that a plane had crashed.\n\n“Some people claimed a missile hit the Pentagon.

The problem is our government lies to us so much to protect the Deep State, it’s hard sometimes to know what is real and what is not,” she  said  on X in 2020.\n\nBut a month after becoming a member of the House, she  said : “9/11 absolutely happened.

So that I definitely want to tell you all, I do not believe it’s fake.”\n\nShortly before being elected to the House, she said: “Muslims do not belong in government.”\n\nIn 2021, she posted an Islamophobic thread on X,  saying : “It’s not irrational to fear Islamic terrorism or a religion that states it’s goal is world domination and the death of infidels,” drawing condemnation from House members.\n\nIn 2021, she was stripped of her House committee assignments over her past incendiary comments and her apparent support for violence against Democrats.\n\nGreene has also been called out by House members for her racist views towards Black people.\n\nAccording to  a June 2020 Politico report, Greene called Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists “idiots” and compared them to neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members. The BLM movement, which highlights racial inequalities in the US, began after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a police officer in the US in June 2020 during an arrest.\n\nGreene has also been accused of expressing anti-Semitic views. According to US media reports, in 2018, she had said in a Facebook post that the wildfires in California could have been caused by an international cabal tied to Jews. She has since deleted the post.\n\nIn 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she compared anti-COVID measures such as wearing masks to the yellow stars Jews were forced to wear during the Nazi era.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the time condemned her views.\n\n“Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling,” McCarthy posted on X."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-01-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-13:00","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera - Science and Technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including a G4 geomagnetic storm alert from the US weather agency, Amazon's large-scale layoffs, political claims about Tylenol and autism by former President Trump, environmental efforts in Delhi using cloud seeding, and major developments in AI and medical innovation such as Nvidia's global tech strategies, OpenAI's $500 billion valuation, and breakthroughs in mRNA-based cancer vaccines.

other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/at-least-2-dead-21-missing-in-landslides-in-indonesias-java-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:54:13+00:00","title":"At least 2 dead, 21 missing in landslides in Indonesia’s Java island","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A landslide in the Cilacap district of Central Java, Indonesia, killed at least two people and left 21 missing after days of heavy rainfall.

flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has issued a report warning that the global expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure — including over 18,000 operational sites and more than 3,500 under development — threatens the lives of at least 2 billion people and exacerbates climate change.

urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135

destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense

It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1k0x2k2lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"05:37:42.472+00:00","title":"Thirteen injured after demolition derby car hits crowd in Australia","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A demolition derby during the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally in southeastern Australia resulted in 13 injuries, two of them critical, when a vehicle drove through a fence and hit the crowd.

is reiterating her calls for the release of all Epstein files, after US President Donald Trump called her a \"traitor\" and said he no longer supports her.\n\nSpeaking to CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Greene told host Dana Bash that while she still supports the president, she does not agree with his efforts to keep the Epstein files under wraps.\n\nShe said Trump's attacks on her are not just perpetuating toxic in-fighting in politics, but also putting her safety at risk.\n\n\"He called me a traitor, and that is so extremely wrong, and those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,\" said Greene.\n\nGreene and Trump's relationship has grown increasingly rocky in the past few weeks  after Greene pushed for the Department of Justice to release all files it has on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe tension escalated on Friday when  Trump condemned Greene  on Truth Social calling her a \"traitor\", \"wacky\", and a \"ranting Lunatic\".\n\nAll she does is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN\", Trump wrote.\n\nWhile Trump's post does not mention the Epstein files, Greene told CNN that her fallout with the president has \"all come down to the Epstein files\".\n\nThe House is expected to hold a vote this week on whether to release the files to the public, and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie said in an interview with ABC News on Sunday that as many as 100 GOP members could vote in favour.\n\nKnown as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump and Epstein were friends in the early 2000s. The US president has said a falling out ended the relationship before Epstein's legal troubles began and he has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nStill, he has faced bipartisan criticism over his handling of the case records.\n\n\"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files, and I don't believe that rich, powerful people should be protected if they have done anything wrong,\" Greene told Bash.\n\nGreene questioned why Trump is pushing so hard to keep the files from public view, but added that she believes Epstein's victims who she says have told her that Trump did nothing illegal.\n\nShe said she's also focused on ending hate and division in politics, which she said is splitting apart American families, friends and neighbours.\n\n\"I think America needs to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide, and I'm leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,\" she told Bash.\n\nIt's a stark messaging shift for Greene, who has previously been accused of stoking political divisions by promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories and elevating controversial posts on social media. She liked a post that called for the executions of former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama, and posted a photo of herself holding a gun beside images of three progressive Democratic congresswomen.\n\nWhen Bash brought up some of these examples, Greene reiterated her past apologies and said a core part of her Christian faith is forgiveness."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that mRNA vaccines used for COVID-19 may significantly improve survival rates in cancer patients by activating the immune system to detect and attack tumors.

vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620yzjpxlvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:48:32.189+00:00","title":"YouTuber Jack Doherty arrested in Miami on drug possession charges","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"YouTuber Jack Doherty, known for his provocative pranks and street-based videos, was arrested in Miami on drug possession charges while filming content and blocking traffic.

scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will 'limited' US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article addresses the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s announcement of resuming U.S. nuclear weapons testing, which has been clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright to involve only noncritical system tests—such as component evaluations—without nuclear explosions.

States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7970p2wx7ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"20:39:01.747+00:00","title":"Illegal migration tearing UK apart, Mahmood says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced sweeping asylum policy reforms aimed at reducing illegal migration, including requiring asylum seekers to wait 20 years before applying for permanent settlement and subjecting refugee status to every two-and-a-half-year reviews.

migration is \"tearing the country apart\", the home secretary has said, as she prepares to unveil major plans to overhaul asylum policy.\n\nNew measures set to be announced by Shabana Mahmood on Monday will include people granted asylum needing to wait 20 years before they can apply to settle permanently.\n\nThe plans will also see those granted asylum have their refugee status regularly reviewed and those whose home countries are then deemed safe told to return.\n\nMahmood told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme she saw tackling illegal migration as a \"moral mission\".\n\nShadow home secretary Chris Philp said the Conservatives would deport illegal migrants \"within a week\", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for asylum seekers to have the right to work.\n\nThe changes are aimed at making the UK a less attractive destination for illegal migrants, leading to reduced small boat crossings and asylum claims.\n\nMahmood is also to announce the UK will stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo if their governments do not rapidly improve co-operation on removals.\n\nA Home Office source said the countries were being targeted \"for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes\".\n\nAs first reported in the Times the threat of the visa ban for certain countries comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.\n\nMany specific details and practicalities of the sweeping changes to asylum policy are yet to be made clear, and will be set out by Mahmood on Monday.\n\nThe home secretary added her plans also aimed to address \"unfair\" conditions that she said gave some asylum seekers better provisions than UK citizens.\n\nShe said: \"I know illegal migration is causing huge divides here in our own country, and I do believe we need to act if we are to retain public consent for having an asylum system at all.\"\n\nCurrently refugee status lasts for five years, after which people can apply for indefinite leave to remain or settled status. Mahmood wants to lengthen this to 20 years.\n\nThe new measures will see refugee statuses reviewed every two-and-a-half years.\n\nMahmood told the BBC that asylum seekers who use \"safe and legal routes\", find work and contribute to society may be able to apply to settle permanently earlier, though did not give specific details.\n\nThe policy has been inspired by Denmark, where a government led by the centre-left Social Democrats has presided over one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.\n\nIn Denmark, refugees are given temporary residence permits, typically of two years, and in effect have to re-apply for asylum when they expire.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said the country's policies were also about \"sending a message to the human smugglers that you shouldn't prefer Denmark\".\n\n\"What is important is this balance to avoid illegal migration but then at the same time welcome legal migration when it's needed,\" he told BBC Radio 4's the World This Weekend.\n\nHowever, Mahmood's hardline approach has already faced opposition from some Labour MPs, including Clive Lewis, who told the BBC the Danish system echoed \"talking points of the far right\" and warned left-wing Labour voters may turn to the Green Party in response.\n\nMahmood rejected this, saying: \"I am the child of migrants myself, my parents came to this country lawfully in the late 60s, and in the 70s. Immigration is absolutely woven into my experience as a Brit and also that of thousands of my constituents.\n\n\"This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.\n\n\"People can see huge pressure in their communities and they can also see a system that is broken, and where people are able to flout the rules, abuse the system and get away with it.\"\n\nMahmood also plans to make housing and weekly financial allowances \"discretionary\" and remove them from those who have a right to work in the UK but do not.\n\nThe home secretary was asked why she wanted to revoke asylum seeker support, despite the UK being \"less generous\" than France, Germany and Denmark when it came to support.\n\nShe said criminal gangs were selling packages to UK to asylum seekers, telling them they will receive free hotels and food, and that \"we know we need to deal with those pull factors\".\n\nThe current system had \"no expectation\" that the 10% of asylum seekers have the right to work will actually support themselves, she says, and there is also no expectation that \"if you break the law of this country you lose your accommodation\".\n\n\"That actually places those individuals in a better position than most British citizens in social housing in this country,\" she said, adding: \"I think that is a basic principle of fairness.\"\n\nPhilp dismissed Mahmood's plans to reform asylum policy as \"gimmicks,\" telling Laura Kuenssberg they were merely \"tinkering with the edges\" of the problem.\n\n\"I don't object to it in principle, but it's not going to work,\" he told the BBC, adding that the Conservatives would withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\n\n\"I would go even further and say if someone gets here illegally they won't be able to claim asylum at all and should be deported within a week.\"\n\nThe home secretary is expected to say on Monday what the government wants to do in terms of changes to legislation and how the right to family life under Article 8 of the ECHR is applied in immigration cases.\n\nDavey said his party had \"some concerns\" about the government's proposed changes to asylum in the UK, but he would \"look at the details\".\n\nHe argued asylum seekers should be given the right to work, as they then \"wouldn't need [government] support\", and this would be \"better for the economy, and better for asylum seekers\".\n\nReform leader Nigel Farage said the home secretary \"sounds like a Reform supporter\".\n\n\"It's a shame that the Human Rights Act, ECHR and her own backbenchers mean that this will never happen,\" he added.\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said rather than deter migrants, the 20-year timeframe would \"leave people in limbo and in tense anxiety for many, many years\".\n\n\"We need a system that is controlled and is fair, and the way you do that is you make decisions fairly, in a timely fashion, and if someone is found to be a refugee, they go on and they contribute to our communities and they pay back,\" he told BBC Breakfast on Sunday.\n\nAgob, a Syrian refugee who has lived under Denmark's strict asylum rules for 13 years, says the uncertainty of the system \"sits in your body\".\n\n\"It means that you rebuild everything while knowing it can be taken away from you at any moment,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"You can't really integrate when the system constantly treats you as temporary.\"\n\nMadeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory, said it is hard to measure the impact of individual policies on refugee numbers.\n\n\"At least initially, asylum seekers often don't actually know what the policies are,\" she told the BBC.\n\nEven with stricter rules, there are still many reasons people might come to the UK, she said. They might speak English, have family in the country, or have already had asylum claims rejected elsewhere.\n\nA total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the UK in the 12 months to March this year, a 17% increase on the year before, according to government data.\n\nMr Solomon said concern about the increasing number of asylum claims was because people feel \"the government has forgotten about their communities\".\n\nAccording to the latest Home Office figures, 1,069 migrants arrived in the UK in the last seven days.\n\nFigures show there have been 10,289 arrivals by small boats since Mahmood became home secretary on 5 September this year. The total so far for 2025 is more than 39,000.\n\nThe number of arrivals this year is higher than the whole of 2024 (36,816) and 2023 (29,437), but below the total at this point in 2022 (39,929)."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dz9zly83o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:42:21.898+00:00","title":"Leader of Ecuador's Los Lobos drugs gang captured in Spain","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wilmer 'Pipo' Chavarria, the head of Ecuador's powerful Los Lobos drug gang, has been captured in Malaga, Spain, in a joint operation with Spanish police and Ecuadorian authorities.

Lobos drugs gang captured in Spain\n\nThe leader of one of Ecuador's biggest drug-trafficking gangs has been captured in an operation involving Spanish police, Ecuador's president Daniel Noboa has said.\n\nWilmer \"Pipo\" Chavarria, the head of Los Lobos, was detained in the city of Malaga, according to Spain's National Police.\n\nPresident Noboa said Chavarria had faked his own death, changed his identity and hidden in Europe while continuing to control criminal operations in Ecuador, including illegal mining and ordering murders.\n\nHis family had claimed in 2021 that he had died from a heart attack due to Covid.\n\nBoth Ecuador and the US have designated Los Lobos (The Wolves) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn a  post on X , Ecuador's interior minister John Reimberg, who said he was in Spain with police, said the capture of Chavarria was a \"historic day\" for his country.\n\nLos Lobos is estimated to have 8,000 members and is one of the most powerful criminal organisations in Ecuador.\n\nIn June 2024, the US Treasury sanctioned the gang and described it as a group with \"thousands of members\" that had significantly contributed to the increase in violence in Ecuador.\n\nViolence and murders have soared in Ecuador in recent years as it has  become a major cocaine trafficking hub  and rival gangs compete for control. It does not produce the drug, but sits next to major drug-producing countries such as Peru and Colombia.\n\nPresident Noboa has defined his presidency through a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs.\n\nThe high-profile arrest coincides with a referendum in Ecuador on whether to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in the country again.\n\nThe US held one on Ecuador's Pacific coast until 2009, when the left-wing president at the time Rafael Correa did not renew it and banned them constitutionally.\n\nUS Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has recently toured military facilities in Ecuador.\n\nPresident Noboa told the BBC earlier this year that he wanted US and European armies  to join his \"war\" against what he called \"narco-terrorists.\"\n\nThe US is expanding military operations in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. It has deployed troops  and a naval strike force centred around the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier  to the region.\n\nAdditionally, it has carried out at least 20 strikes  on alleged narco-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean , killing at least 80 people.\n\nIt has not yet provided evidence about those on board and some lawyers have argued the strikes could breach international law.\n\nMany Los Lobos members are in jail and the gang is thought to have instigated some of Ecuador's  bloodiest prison riots .\n\nThe gang is thought to have links to the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel in Mexico."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkz5k5erzgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"01:58:03.167+00:00","title":"At least four dead after migrant boats sink in Mediterranean","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At least four people have died after two migrant boats capsized off the coast of Libya, with all confirmed fatalities being Bangladeshi nationals on a boat carrying 26 people.

data centre in the shed'\n\nAn Essex couple have become the first people in the country to trial a scheme that sees them heat their home using a data centre in their garden shed.\n\nTerrence and Lesley Bridges have seen their energy bills drop dramatically, from £375 a month down to as low as £40, since they swapped their gas boiler for a HeatHub – a small data centre containing more than 500 computers.\n\nData centres are banks of computers which carry out digital tasks. As the computers process data, they generate lots of heat, which is captured by oil and then transferred into the Bridges' hot water system.\n\nMr Bridges, 76, says keeping his two-bed bungalow near Braintree warm was a necessity as his wife has spinal stenosis and is in \"a lot of pain\" when it gets colder.\n\n\"It truly is brilliant,\" Mr Bridges continues. \"I'm over the moon that we got picked to trial this out. You can't fault the heating system – it is a 100% improvement on what we had before.\"\n\n\"You don't need to go to a sauna after coming here,\" Mrs Bridges, 75, adds.\n\nThe HeatHub was developed by Thermify and is part of UK Power Networks'  SHIELD project , which aims to come up with innovative ways for low-income households to transition to net zero.\n\nThrough SHIELD, the Bridges also had solar panels and a battery put in, which have contributed to their savings.\n\nMr Bridges, a retired RAF sergeant, says despite putting \"the heating up fairly high to keep it nice and warm\", his bill has fallen to between £40 and £60 each month.\n\n\"I think it's fantastic because it's eco-friendly,\" he continues, \"we're not burning any gases, so it's green – it's environmentally friendly.\"\n\nThermify co-founder and CEO Travis Theune says the Bridges' HeatHub will eventually be part of a \"remote and distributed\" data centre, involving many units processing data for customers.\n\nWhile not designed for the heavy processing needed for artificial intelligence, Mr Theune says the system could run things like apps or analyse large volumes of data.\n\nHe says the company wanted to design a system to provide both \"clean\" and \"affordable\" energy because \"finding a way to do both was a hard problem\".\n\nThe project is still in the pilot phase, but in the future, clients will pay Thermify to process their data using the HeatHubs.\n\nMr Theune adds the system provides \"clean, green heat at a low-to-no price point\" because \"the electricity that's generating that heat is paid for by somebody else\".\n\nThe Bridges' landlord, social housing provider Eastlight Community Homes, is also part of SHIELD.\n\nDaniel Greenwood, Eastlight's head of asset management, says he hopes the next phase of the project will see 50 homes get HeatHubs, and adds: \"We've seen great results for the current installation, and although this is the first of its kind, we're looking to roll that out more broadly.\"\n\nJack McKellar, UK Power Networks’ innovation programme manager, says: \"We don't want anyone to miss out on the benefits of new and emerging technologies, as the UK moves towards a greener future.\"\n\nData centres help run the modern world. It is estimated they consume about 2.5% of the UK's electricity, and as more are built, their power demand could rise fourfold by 2030.\n\nThermify is not alone in trying to capture and use the heat generated by data centres.\n\nA  swimming pool in Devon  is being warmed by a washing machine-sized \"digital boiler\".\n\nThe company behind that scheme is also involved in a proposal to build the  Melbourn Energy Superloop  – a combined solar-powered data centre and district heat network in south Cambridgeshire.\n\nMilton Keynes University Hospital  was also hoping  to be the first place in the city to benefit from £95m plans to share heat from a new data centre.\n\nAccording to the  International Energy Agency , data centres use up to 30% of their electricity consumption on cooling.\n\nMike Richardson, the 66-year-old founder and owner of DSM, says he had tried to incorporate \"nature\" as much as possible into his data centre at a former RAF base just off the A1 near Peterborough.\n\nA 200kW array of solar panels helps power it, and a 500 cubic-metre artificial lake cools it down.\n\nThe lake is filled with water collected from the roof of an old aircraft hangar and pumped from two boreholes.\n\nFour heat exchangers are submerged in the 1.7 metre deep water, which is also home to dozens of koi carp and tench – fish that have their own role in the operation.\n\n\"We need to keep the pipes clean, and they eat the algae,\" Mr Richardson tells the BBC.\n\nWith a 400kW capacity, the data centre is relatively small – or \"boutique\", according to Mr Richardson.\n\nWarm water is pumped from data racks to heat exchangers in the lake, then the cooled water is sent back inside, in a closed loop.\n\nTraditional cooling systems often rely on compressing a chemical coolant, which can be toxic.\n\n\"Keeping away from chemicals is an important thing for us,\" Mr Richardson says.\n\nHe adds that because there was no need for compression, the setup used much less electricity for cooling.\n\nDoes it work?\n\n\"Yes, it works – it most definitely works,\" Mr Richardson says.\n\nBut adds that relying on nature comes with \"challenges\" because \"nature by default is not something which is, you know, stable\".\n\n\"It takes a bit of management, but it's all doable,\" he continues.\n\nThe system, while small-scale, can be scaled up with a larger body of water, he explains.\n\n\"Water is one of the best mediums for heat transfer,\" he says.\n\nMicrosoft has also experimented with an underwater data centre.\n\nProject Natick  saw more than 850 servers sunk in a giant metal tube off the coast of Orkney between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThere are  reports  that Chinese companies were also planning to sink data centres into the ocean.\n\nFollow East of England news on  X ,  Instagram  and Facebook:  BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks ,  BBC Cambridgeshire ,  BBC Essex ,  BBC Norfolk ,  BBC Northamptonshire  or  BBC Suffolk ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk0nd1nq6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:16:05.158+00:00","title":"Red Fort explosion: Man arrested over deadly Delhi car bomb blast","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car bomb attack in Delhi killed eight people and injured 20 others, occurring near the Red Fort — one of India’s most iconic landmarks.

the artefacts \"bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the indigenous peoples\".\n\nThe items, which came from several different communities around Canada, had been sent by missionaries to Rome to appear in a 1925 exhibition that displayed over 100,000 items.\n\nAmong the artefacts being returned is an Inuit kayak that had historically been used to hunt whales in Canada's far north, and a set of embroidered gloves that came from the Cree Nation.\n\nCanada's ambassador to the Holy See  told CBC News  that the items are currently in storage in Rome,

The church has described the items as \"gifts\" that were given by tribal leaders.

its new female-focused TikTok channel, Halo, after it faced a backlash online with its posts described as \"patronising\" and \"sexist\".\n\nIn a statement posted on social media on Saturday night, the broadcaster said it \"didn't get it right\" and that it would be \"stopping all activity\" on the account.\n\nThe channel, which was only announced on Thursday, was described by the broadcaster as an \"inclusive, dedicated platform for women to enjoy and explore content from all sports, while amplifying female voices and perspectives.\"\n\nHowever, many on social media criticised the \"little sister\" account, which talked about \"hot girl walks\" and matcha in its content.\n\nAt its inception, Sky said Halo's aim was \"to build a welcoming community for female fans, whether casual or committed, through fun, trend-led, and relatable content\".\n\nOne post saw a clip of Manchester City players Rayan Cherki and Erling Haaland combining for the latter to score against Bournemouth, given the caption \"How the matcha + hot girl walk combo hits\".\n\nViewers argued the posts were \"infantilising\" and undermined the work done over the past few years to put women's sport in the spotlight.\n\nAmong those criticising the channel was Emily Trees, 23, who told BBC Newsbeat that she thought Halo calling themselves the \"little sister\" of Sky Sports was a \"really damaging\" thing to say.\n\n\"We've spent the last 50 years trying to come away from the stereotypes around women's sport, and trying to make women's sport seen as an entity in itself rather than just as an extension of what men can do. We deserve our own space, something that's ours. We don't need to be the 'little sister' to anyone,\" she said.\n\nGirlsontheBall, a prominent platform covering women's football, voiced its frustrations saying on X they could not \"imagine this is what women sports fans want\".\n\n\"Have many thoughts which I will get to when not under a mountain of writing but all I can ask is why? The branding (one day can we please be past the pink/peach stage?!), the premise, the copy…\"\n\nSports fan Millie Jones, 27, told BBC Newsbeat that she did not think women needed a separate space for content, rather, she says, they need to be equally represented in the content Sky Sports already put out.\n\n\"As a sports fan, I've consumed generic Sky Sports media for the entirety of the time that I've been into sport. I don't need a pink, glittery sidepiece to the normal content,\" she said.\n\nOne user said that Sky Sports Halo was one of the worst concepts he had ever seen.\n\n\"So condescending. Creating a dumbed down sports channel for women is unbelievably sexist. Incredible that it was approved and that it's still live,\" they said.\n\nSome social media users have also created spoof posts of the channel's content which have been widely shared.\n\nWhile the channel was aimed at women many of the sports stars featured in its posts were men.\n\nAndy Gill, head of social media and audience development at Sky Sports, wrote on LinkedIn that he \"couldn't be prouder and more excited about [Halo's] launch\", but by Saturday night the broadcaster was forced to rethink.\n\nAll but two posts have been deleted from the Halo account, one of which is a brief statement from Sky which reads: \"Our intention for Halo was to create a space alongside our existing channel for new, young, female fans.\n\n\"We've listened. We didn't get it right. As a result we're stopping all activity on this account. We're learning and remain as committed as ever to creating spaces where fans feel included and inspired.\"\n\nThe BBC contacted Sky for comment but it had nothing further to add.\n\nCorrection 16 November: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to one post as having been published by Halo but it was a mock-up not produced by the channel."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8glerlyrgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"02:55:31.961+00:00","title":"Americans survived one government shutdown and brace for another","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 43-day government shutdown in 2025 — the longest in U.S. history — left millions of Americans facing financial hardship, including military families, federal employees, and SNAP recipients.

decisions.\n\nSome 1.3 million active-duty personnel are required to serve during government shutdowns potentially without pay, but the Trump administration stepped in twice during the autumn shutdown to reallocate funds for those servicemembers.\n\nBut without certainty, many families had to tighten their belts. One of Ms Johnson’s sons even offered to get fewer Christmas Gifts - “it’s ok we don’t need them,” he said to his mother.\n\nMs Johnson is frustrated by what she described as unnecessary sacrifice from millions of Americans.\n\n“What was it all for? Why were we suffering for over 40 days in uncertainty, not knowing what was going to happen,\" she questioned. \"What was the point? We’re just going to go through this again probably in January.”\n\nThe agreement Congress made this week funds the government for the next two months, guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - which provides food aid to one in eight Americans - until next September.\n\nSierra Bird is one of the more than 42 million Americans who depend on funds from Snap to feed her family.\n\nThe Florida mother of four gets about $900 a month, but those funds were delayed because they were caught up in the spending bill.\n\nMs Bird said she \"survived\" the shutdown and her Snap card will be reloaded over the weekend.\n\nShe'll return to some sense of normal, but she's also weary another shutdown could be on the horizon and she said she would start stockpiling food, just in case.\n\n\"People are going to take what they need if they don't have what they need,\" Ms Bird said. \"Don't mess with people's food.\"\n\nWhile Snap benefits have resumed, one thing that hasn't come back is health-insurance subsidies. It was those subsidies that Democrats had said they were willing to fight for, which helped fuel the shutdown in the first place.\n\nDemocrats had said they would not approve the budget unless the subsidies continued. But on Tuesday, eight Democrats sided with Republicans to approve a spending plan without them.\n\n\"I swapped one stress for another,\" Ms Bird said. \"I would rather have the affordable healthcare than Snap, because I can feed them rice and beans and survive, but I need my medications.\"\n\nIn addition to those struggling to put food on the table during the shutdown, more than 1.4 million federal employees went without pay for 43 days.\n\nSarah, a Utah Interior Department employee who asked her last name not be used, was among them.\n\nShe was furloughed from the start of the shutdown on 1 October and as the days and weeks went by she worried she would have to find another way to make money.\n\n\"I was trying to decide if I wanted to give up the federal sector altogether to find another career,\" Sarah said.\n\nAs an archaeologist, she works in a unique, specialised role, making it hard to transfer her expertise to another job or industry.\n\nHer worries were quelled on Thursday when she returned to work for the first time in weeks, following the government's reopening, but she is already preparing for the prospect of another one come January.\n\n\"With the holidays coming up, I'm not going to spending a whole lot of money,\" she said, noting she is putting off certain remodelling projects too.\n\n\"I would not be the least bit surprised if another shutdown happened.\"\n\nIn the less than 80 days until the next potential government shutdown, Ms Johnson, the military wife, said she would be preparing, just in case.\n\n\"We're making a huge effort to watch unnecessary spending and save money where we can so we have a bigger nest egg built up because if the government shuts down again in January there's no guarantee that active duty military is going to get paid.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8vm30rr78o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"03:14:59.394+00:00","title":"Thousands protest against government in Mexico City as clashes leave 120 injured","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of demonstrators, led by Gen Z youth groups, protested in Mexico City against President Claudia Sheinbaum’s government, citing rising violent crime and the assassination of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Manzo.

And they must remember to always take their prescription to avoid being criminalised.\n\nSome say they still live in fear of being stopped by police, dismissed from their jobs, or even losing access to their children because of what they describe as the stigma attached to cannabis.\n\nOne patient told the BBC she had a letter from her neighbour complaining about the smell of cannabis coming from her flat.\n\n\"I was scared,\" admitted Kat Turner, 26, who puts pillows in front of her door in an attempt to stop the smell spreading.\n\n\"They could have called the police, that was my fear. I use my front door as little as possible because I'm afraid of any smell going into the communal area.\"\n\nKat takes cannabis after being diagnosed with functional neurological disorder, but the drug can also be prescribed for things like PTSD, OCD, anxiety and depression.\n\nJon admitted he was \"nervous\" about telling his work he took medicinal cannabis for his anxiety because he thought his bosses might think he'll be working \"doped up\".\n\n\"In films and comedy programmes it's funny to depict people who smoke weed as lazy and clumsy,\" said Jon. \"But really, that's not how it is. It just calms me down a little bit.\"\n\nJon works for one of the country's largest employers and said they've been incredibly supportive - but asked him not to name them.\n\nPatients and clinics that prescribe cannabis say there is little public awareness cannabis can be legal with a prescription, and Jon was worried some people just think of a \"lazy stoner\" when talking about someone who uses cannabis.\n\nHe was first given medical cannabis after a mental health \"breakdown\" in his late 30s.\n\n\"I'll get big spikes in my anxiety, dwell on random incidents from the past and start panicking about the most random things,\" said Jon.\n\n\"Weed stops all of that for me.\"\n\nJon, who was recently diagnosed with autism and is awaiting a possible ADHD diagnosis, said he was prescribed \"cannabis flower\" - the industry term given to cannabis buds.\n\nOne condition for Jon being able to access this treatment is that the buds must be vaped, in a special cannabis vaporiser, rather than smoked.\n\nThe  most recent data suggests  there were more than 50,000 private cannabis prescriptions in July 2024 - with figures expected to have grown since then.\n\nIt is not just Kat's neighbours who questioned her cannabis usage, she also was not allowed to take her medicinal cannabis into hospital last year.\n\nShe says her functional neurological disorder means she can lose \"total control\" of her body, suffering intense tics and seizures.\n\nThe insurance worker from south Wales was given a three-week in-patient rehabilitation appointment at a specialist NHS unit in Bristol.\n\nBut she told us despite informing staff before arrival, when she got to the hospital she was told she would not be allowed her cannabis.\n\n\"They implied that my medication could be illegal and that they wouldn't be able to really allow it inside,\" said Kat from Cardiff, who uses both cannabis buds and oil.\n\n\"They advised that I would only be able to take the medication if I left hospital grounds.\n\n\"My main concern at that point was how I was going to leave the grounds to use my medication, because I have mobility issues and I'm very vulnerable. Especially because of my seizures.\n\n\"After a lengthy discussion where I was made to feel like a criminal, I had to make the decision to leave. It felt quite devastating. It felt unfair.\"\n\nWhen she was first diagnosed, Kat was told for the best chance of recovery she would need to start treatment within \"three to four weeks\".\n\nHowever, more than three years later treatment had still not begun - and Kat said she relied on cannabis to help control her tics enough to do things like cut up food and brush her teeth.\n\n\"Without being able to take my medication and manage my symptoms, I wouldn't have been able to benefit from the treatment that they were offering me.\"\n\nIn a letter, North Bristol NHS Trust apologised for her experience, but said she was the first patient they had experienced who wanted to vape cannabis, and they were updating their policy to reflect what to do when this happens again.\n\nOne area where medical cannabis patients said they were seeing more understanding was at gigs and nightclubs.\n\n\"I've been able to go to festivals and concerts and things like that with my cannabis on me,\" said Shash Appan, who spends at least £200 a month on her cannabis prescription for PTSD and fibromyalgia.\n\nThe 29-year-old from Cardiff said she often got \"funny looks\" when heading out into the smoking area on a night out, but when confronted by bouncers had always been able to explain it was medical cannabis without problems.\n\n\"One of the main things for me is that I don't have the same degree of night terrors I had before,\" said Shash, who often uses a wheelchair to get around.\n\n\"I know for some people the initial effects can be the munchies or laughing, but I'd much rather have that than the depressive, possibly sleepy, side effects of opiates.\"\n\nDr David Howells is one of the few doctors prescribing medical cannabis, and said in the NHS he had often seen the harm cannabis could do to patients with a history of psychosis.\n\nBut the former NHS psychiatric consultant believes there is growing evidence to support its use for other conditions when supervised by a specialist doctor.\n\n\"The greatest evidence base is for anxiety and pain,\" he said.\n\nDr Howells said his own private patient numbers had grown but many were afraid about how they could be judged for using cannabis.\n\n\"Concerns about being stopped [by police] or what they should tell an employer are some of the largest concerns of patients coming to our clinic,\" he said.\n\nDr Howells said clinic staff had needed to intervene on a patient's behalf with employers, housing associations, family courts and police - describing understanding of the law around medical cannabis as a \"postcode lottery\".\n\nThe boss of another clinic had to recently intervene on behalf of other passengers on a UK flight after armed police boarded following reports of a \"cannabis smell\".\n\n\"They didn't allow the plane to go before confiscating the medication from the patients and releasing it on the conveyor belt when we got to the destination,\" said Jon Robson of online cannabis clinic Mamedica.\n\n\"That would be unheard of with any other type of prescribed medication.\"\n\nDriving under the influence of cannabis is illegal, but  there's a medical exemption  providing patients have followed the dosages prescribed and do not feel impaired.\n\n\"We always advise them that they take their medication out within the pots or packages, that would have their name and details on,\" said Dr Howells. \"That would demonstrate that they are using a legal medical product.\"\n\nThe Police Chiefs' Council said new guidance was being drafted to \"help to alleviate ambiguity\" for police forces around medical cannabis - but reiterated any officer was \"within their rights\" to stop a driver they suspected of being unsafe.\n\nBoth the General Medical Council and Quality Care Commission pointed us to existing guidelines on prescribing when asked to comment.\n\nThe NHS has previously said the risks from cannabis products are \"not currently clear\" and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs are producing a report for the UK government on cannabis-based products for medicinal use. It is due to be published shortly.\n\nDetails of mental health help and support are available at  BBC Action Line"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx3n4r2g04o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:10:10.751+00:00","title":"Charlotte faces DHS crackdown as agents target 'criminal illegal aliens'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal immigration agents from the Department of Homeland Security have launched 'Operation Charlotte's Web' in Charlotte, North Carolina, arresting at least 81 people in a crackdown targeting individuals labeled as 'criminal illegal aliens'.

faces DHS crackdown as agents target 'criminal illegal aliens'\n\nFederal agents have descended on the city of Charlotte in North Carolina as part of US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said.\n\nIn a post on X, US Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said at least 81 people had been arrested in the city on Saturday.\n\nLocal officials, including Mayor of Charlotte Li Vyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing \"unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community.\n\nSince Trump's return to office  he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago  to deliver on his promise of \"the largest deportation programme\" in US history.\n\nThe DHS announced \"Operation Charlotte's Web\" on Saturday, saying \"criminal illegal aliens\" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.\n\n\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.\n\nArmoured vehicles and special operations teams could be involved in the North Charlotte crackdown, according to internal government documents seen by the  BBC's US partner, CBS News.\n\nSeveral church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man,  The Charlotte Observer  reported, quoting the church's pastor.\n\n\"We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,\" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.\n\nOfficials said there are \"a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters\".\n\nThe DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to \"sanctuary policies\".\n\nCharlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place  to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities  - but it is a \"certified welcoming city\". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.\n\n\"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,\" the DHS said.\n\nCharlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to  Data US.\n\nDHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing.\n\nEarlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was \"extremely concerned\" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina.\n\nThe next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed to the city.\n\nOperations in previous cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have come under fire over concerns of excessive use of force."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/us/politics/dhs-agents-reassigned.html","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00+00:00","title":"Community Engagement and Digital Participation in Local Governance","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article in a local newspaper discusses the growing role of community engagement and digital participation in shaping local governance.

The Times also spoke with more than 65 officials who have worked in the federal government during the current Trump administration, in addition to local authorities and others who collaborate with the department. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters and out of fear of retribution.\n\nThe overhaul represents a striking departure for the behemoth agency that Congress created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Department was tasked with preventing terrorism, protecting the president, investigating transnational crime and responding to natural disasters, among other duties. Immigration enforcement was one of many responsibilities, but it was not envisioned as D.H.S.’s singular function.\n\nToday, the Trump administration has remade the agency into a veritable Department of Deportation.\n\nThe shift has had consequences.\n\nHomeland security investigators worked approximately 33 percent fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February through April compared to their average in prior years, according to a Times analysis of data obtained through the F.O.I.A. lawsuit.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking,” said Hany Farid, a computer scientist who helped create software used by law enforcement and technology companies to detect child sexual abuse material. “You can’t say you care about kids when you’re diverting actual resources that are protecting children.”\n\nAdministration officials defended Mr. Trump’s approach, saying the immigration crackdown was paramount to protecting public safety and national security. They also disputed that the intensified focus on immigration had undermined D.H.S.’s work.\n\n“Child exploitation, human trafficking, terrorism, financial scams and smuggling all have a nexus to illegal immigration,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement. “D.H.S. is mobilizing federal and state law enforcement to find, arrest and deport illegal aliens. We are prioritizing the worst of the worst and aliens with final removal orders. Nearly every day we are arresting pedophiles, known or suspected terrorists, kidnappers, child smugglers and sex traffickers, including those who entered our country illegally.”\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said that “any insinuation that the Trump administration isn’t successfully combating dangerous crime is false and uninformed.”\n\nIn fact, federal data shows that many immigrants being arrested do not have criminal records in the United States. Fewer than 40 percent of people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement — the D.H.S. law enforcement agency leading the administration’s crackdown — have a criminal conviction, according to a Times analysis. Roughly 8 percent of those arrested had been convicted of a violent crime, while about 9 percent had a traffic conviction, the analysis found.\n\nThe pressure to deport more people began almost as soon as Mr. Trump took office.\n\nStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of Mr. Trump’s deportation agenda, holds a regular morning conference call with top government officials to plan and execute the massive operation, according to officials briefed on the sessions and a calendar invitation viewed by The Times.\n\nMr. Miller, who comes to the 30-minute calls deeply versed in deportation and arrest data, has at times berated ICE leaders for not arresting enough people, the officials said. And his questions and directives regularly ripple out across the vast D.H.S. bureaucracy.\n\nAgency policy experts who specialize in other issues have been told to analyze immigration data to prepare for and respond to the calls. Special agents at Homeland Security Investigations — which is D.H.S.’s criminal investigations arm and a part of ICE — have been abruptly issued new orders.\n\nThe H.S.I. reassignments have occurred in rotations with thousands of agents being redirected to immigration duties for stints ranging from days to months, according to two officials. H.S.I. has about 7,000 agents in total, who normally investigate transnational criminal organizations and other high-level lawbreakers.\n\nTheir new duties have included compiling addresses of undocumented immigrants, producing reports on student protesters, driving detainees to lockups and making arrests at traffic stops, big-box store parking lots and immigration courts.\n\nEven highly trained specialists have been pulled into immigration work, such as analysts who assist in money laundering and counterterrorism cases and agents who investigate the multibillion-dollar black market for looted antiquities, a source of income for organized crime and terrorist groups.\n\nOther top officials have also felt pressure. In late May, as deportation numbers lagged well below Mr. Trump’s goals, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, joined by Mr. Miller, tried to turbocharge the effort with a warning at the department’s headquarters. Speaking to ICE officials who run the agency’s field offices and had traveled to Washington, Ms. Noem promised that no job at the department would be safe, including her own, if deportations did not pick up, according to people with knowledge of her remarks.\n\nSince then, the number of people in immigration detention has soared past 60,000, a record tally. The Homeland Security Department says it has deported more than 550,000 people, with the daily pace of removals reaching levels not seen since the Obama administration. Illegal border crossings have fallen to their lowest point in decades.\n\nThe Republican policy bill enacted this summer made the administration’s priorities clear, with about $162 billion in new D.H.S. funding for border security and immigration enforcement, significantly shifting the department’s focus. More than half of the department’s annual budget is projected to fund immigration activities over the next few years, up from 37 percent during the last fiscal year, according to a Times analysis.\n\nICE’s budget is expected to nearly triple and its staff to grow by 66 percent, an investment that will make it the nation’s highest-funded law enforcement agency.\n\nAfter a funding boost, immigration programs now make up more than half of the D.H.S. budget, according to a New York Times analysis.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\nHow the new budget breaks down\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nFederal Emergency\n\nManagement Agency\n\n(includes disaster relief)\n\nU.S. Customs and\n\nBorder Protection\n\nU.S. Immigration and\n\nCustoms Enforcement\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\n$70 billion\n\n$41 billion\n\n$77 billion\n\n$81 billion\n\nHow the new budget breaks down\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n\n(includes disaster relief)\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\nU.S. Coast Guard\n\nTransportation\n\nAdministration\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nNotes: Figures are rounded.

Source: New York Times analysis of D.H.S. budget data.\n\nAlicia Parlapiano/The New York Times\n\nThere are no indications the White House pressure will relent.\n\nOn his conference call, Mr. Miller has recently pushed ICE leaders to arrest even more people, pointing to the ongoing hiring spree that will see the agency bring on more than 14,000 new employees, according to the people familiar with his comments.\n\nThe immigration operation has also pulled in thousands of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Drug Enforcement Administration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; and at least four other federal law enforcement agencies, documents show. In addition, agents from D.H.S. and many of those other agencies have been diverted to Mr. Trump’s anti-crime crackdown in Washington, which has functioned as a shadow immigration operation.\n\nEvery incoming administration prioritizes its own policy goals, and homeland security officials often describe a sense of whiplash when a new president takes power. Under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., some agents were pulled off investigations and sent to help process migrants coming over the southern border.\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s overhaul surpasses previous efforts, according to current and former officials.\n\n“D.H.S. keeps being pulled further away from its core missions in protecting the homeland,” said David Lapan, who served as the department’s press secretary during the first Trump administration. “These distractions could have deadly consequences.”\n\nAllies of Mr. Trump including Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II — an acting deputy secretary of homeland security in Mr. Trump’s first term — said such changes were long overdue.\n\nAs one of the authors of Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, Mr. Cuccinelli had conceived of dismantling D.H.S. and setting up a separate agency for immigration enforcement because, he wrote, the department as designed by Congress was too “disjointed.”\n\nBut rather than wait for Congress to enact changes, Mr. Trump has been essentially acting on his own.\n\n“President Trump is effectively changing the permanent course of D.H.S.,” Mr. Cuccinelli told The Times.\n\nHere are six aspects of the Homeland Security Department’s mission that have been acutely disrupted by the immigration crackdown:\n\nEarlier this year, special agents at Homeland Security Investigations found online videos showing violent sexual abuse of an unidentified young child.\n\nTrained to hunt down pedophiles who use the internet to distribute illegal imagery, the H.S.I. agents spent weeks analyzing the footage to try to identify the child and infiltrate the online networks that had shared and may have directed the abuse, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.\n\nBut the agents working the case have since been asked to go out in the field and help arrest undocumented immigrants. The reassignment has hindered progress toward identifying and rescuing the child, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive investigation. The person said that the agents, no longer able to spend as much time undercover online, had lost contact with a key source they had cultivated over years in the online world of abusers.\n\nThe disruption of that case reflects a broader pattern, The Times investigation found.\n\nH.S.I. teams that investigate sex crimes against children in cities including Newark and Los Angeles have had significant numbers of special agents dragooned into immigration work, according to people with knowledge of the changes. At one point, an entire unit of roughly five people investigating child exploitation in Los Angeles was working immigration duty, with agents trying to advance their cases on nights and weekends, one of those people said.\n\nFrom February through April of this year, H.S.I. agents nationwide worked the fewest hours on child exploitation that they have during that period in more than a decade, according to The Times’s data analysis.\n\nDuring that same period, H.S.I. agents spent at least five times as many hours working immigration cases as they did on average during Mr. Trump’s first term. More recent data was not available because of the government shutdown.\n\nThe number of hours agents spent on child exploitation cases likely decreased even further over the summer and fall, as D.H.S. increased its focus on immigration enforcement during that period, according to people interviewed by The Times. The data also suggested a likely drop in the number of arrests and child victims identified, but appeared too provisional to support a reliable estimate.\n\nMs. McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokeswoman, said that under the Trump administration “law enforcement has continued to rescue children from sex offenders and traffickers.” She added that H.S.I. is “not slowing down and remains committed to all aspects of its mission, leveraging a whole-of-government approach to address threats to public safety and national security.”\n\nA shift has been noticed at some of Silicon Valley’s largest tech companies, which report tens of millions of photographs and videos showing suspected child abuse each year to the authorities.\n\nEngineers who work on child safety issues at Google, Meta, Microsoft and other companies told The Times that there had been a noticeable drop in follow-up from federal officials regarding the materials they had flagged. Some of them had heard from law enforcement contacts that resources were being shifted to immigration cases.\n\nMicrosoft and Meta declined to comment. Google did not respond to questions.\n\nFor nearly a decade, a team of roughly two dozen special agents from H.S.I. and F.B.I. offices in Washington, New York, Minneapolis and other cities have investigated Iran’s efforts to evade international sanctions and sell oil on the black market. The cases often involve chasing a so-called ghost fleet of tankers carrying that oil to foreign ports.\n\nIran uses the profits to fund its military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which the United States has designated a terrorist entity, as well as Hamas and the Houthi government in Yemen, federal authorities have said.\n\nBut since the immigration crackdown, cases where officials worked to seize tankers loaded with Iranian oil and bank accounts where profits are stored have languished for months, with agents too busy on immigration duty to interview sources or draft seizure affidavits, according to roughly half a dozen people with knowledge of the effort. In the meantime, ships and cash have disappeared before they could be seized, and arrests have been delayed, some of those people said.\n\nA typical investigative task that normally takes a day “now takes two weeks,” one person said. Another said that “money and oil have gotten away.”\n\nD.H.S. did not respond to a question about the status of its agents working on the Iranian oil cases. Natalie Baldassarre, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which plays a leading role in the probes, said it was “acutely focused” on protecting national security and stopping criminals.\n\n“Assisting our partners with immigration enforcement has not deterred our ability to also successfully investigate and prosecute other types of crime,” Ms. Baldassare said.\n\nOne of D.H.S.’s major functions is distributing intelligence reports about terrorism, active shooter incidents and other threats across government, an attempt to fill the gap in information sharing exposed by the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nBut employees at D.H.S.’s intelligence office have been increasingly directed to focus more on supporting immigration enforcement than on other security issues, according to people familiar with its operations. That shift in emphasis has affected the daily intelligence briefings that go to top officials, according to these people.\n\nAnd local law enforcement authorities are now receiving far fewer intelligence reports than they normally would, according to people familiar with the reports. One official said the decline in information sharing has amounted to “chipping away at everything that’s been built since Sept. 11.”\n\nD.H.S. said that it had identified “redundant positions and noncritical programs” at the intelligence office and that it was returning the department “back to its core mission of prioritizing American safety and enforcing our laws.”\n\nThe federal government’s main law enforcement training academy has suspended many of its programs for nonimmigration agents for the rest of the year, aiming to make room for the thousands of new deportation officers being hired by ICE. That has delayed classes for new recruits and experienced officers from other agencies.\n\nAffected agencies include the Secret Service, the Army Criminal Investigative Division, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the Energy Department’s Office of Secure Transportation, which is responsible for safely moving nuclear weapons and components, according to seven people with knowledge of the delays.\n\n“We must focus our resources on surge-related training” for immigration enforcement, officials at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers wrote in a memo this summer. “As a result, training programs for agencies not directly involved in these efforts, originally scheduled between Sept. 9 and Dec. 31, 2025, will be rescheduled to later dates.”\n\nHeather J. Hagan, a U.S. Army spokeswoman, said that the Army’s law enforcement arm lost 111 classroom spots at the academy after “numerous advanced courses” were canceled.\n\nTwo special agents at the Diplomatic Security Service, which provides protection for diplomats and U.S. embassies, said disruptions at the federal training academy had delayed the on-boarding of new recruits, raising the possibility of staffing shortages overseas.\n\nD.H.S. said that the academy was “actively adjusting and rescheduling training schedules as needed.” Spokespeople for agencies that have had training schedules altered told The Times that their core missions and recruitment efforts had not been hindered.\n\nIn June, Coast Guard officials agreed to redeploy two C-27 planes from Clearwater, Fla., to Alexandria, La., where ICE maintains its busiest detention center, and another plane from Sacramento to Mesa, Ariz., according to documents reviewed by The Times and a person familiar with the arrangement. The planes are surveillance craft used in drug interdiction and other missions.\n\nSearch-and-rescue planes from Alaska and North Carolina were also put “on call,” the documents show.\n\nThe redeployment of the planes posed a “high risk to mission fail” for certain Coast Guard operations, one of the documents stated.\n\nThe Coast Guard also made plans to send dozens of staff members to support immigration enforcement. The initial cost, including the plane deployment, was estimated to be around $7 million, according to the documents.\n\nThis month, the search-and-rescue leader for a Coast Guard regional command center was told he had to report within days to Texas for a monthslong border deployment, leaving other staff members to cover for him, according to a person familiar with the situation and documents viewed by The Times.\n\nD.H.S. said that the Coast Guard had transported more than 7,300 immigrants so far this year. A Coast Guard spokesman said it “carefully balances all operations and mission requirements, including search and rescue, to ensure readiness is not compromised.”\n\nThe pressure to ramp up low-level immigration enforcement has had negative impacts on more complex human smuggling and sex and labor trafficking cases, according to federal officials.\n\nOne federal prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that such cases were stagnating as H.S.I. investigators were sidetracked with immigration roundups. Agents from H.S.I.’s Center for Countering Human Trafficking, which assists trafficking investigations, have been reassigned to Mr. Trump’s anti-crime crackdown in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement official.\n\nAnd one former law enforcement official who now works in the travel industry said that after he tried to report sex trafficking at hotels to H.S.I., he was told that agents might not be able to investigate urgently because of immigration duty.\n\nD.H.S. disputed that those investigations had been affected.\n\nHow The Times Analyzed D.H.S. Data\n\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, The New York Times obtained Department of Homeland Security statistical reports that indicate the monthly number of hours worked, arrests made, and search warrants executed by Homeland Security Investigations staff working on investigations into child exploitation, immigration, and other crimes.\n\nThe Times received two responses, one generated in April and the other in June, with monthly figures going back to to 2022 and 2007, respectively. The response created in June included some figures that were greater than those in the April report.\n\nAs a result, The Times took a cautious approach in quantifying trends. To estimate the hours worked during February, March and April, the first three full months of the administration, The Times took into account the percentage increase for a comparable period between the two reports. Because the revisions followed a less predictable pattern for arrests and victims, The Times decided against citing direct figures for those categories, although the provisional figures also showed declines.\n\nD.H.S. did not respond to questions seeking clarity on the data.\n\nReporting was contributed by John Ismay, Eric Schmitt, Sheera Frenkel, Alicia Parlapiano, Albert Sun, Eileen Sullivan, Jeff Adelson, Kate Conger, Alex Klavens, Maxine Joselow and Devlin Barrett.

They beat people behind closed doors. And they encouraged favored inmates to join in on the brutality.\n\nFormer inmates and guards said the violence at the Rankin County jail created a culture of fear and was widely accepted by officials as a way of keeping order, an investigation by The New York Times and Mississippi Today has found.\n\nMore than a dozen former inmates recounted being beaten for nonviolent infractions, like talking back to guards or getting caught with contraband. Many said a special group of inmates, known as trusties, helped guards beat troublemakers, lending fists whenever needed. Sometimes, the jail’s highest-ranking officials instigated the punishments or handed them down themselves, according to former guards and inmates.\n\nThe Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, which runs the jail, has a documented history of brazen violence. Last year, the Justice Department began investigating the agency for potential civil rights violations after The Times and Mississippi Today revealed that a group of detectives and patrol deputies, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” had been torturing suspected drug users for nearly 20 years.\n\nThis portrait of life inside the Rankin County jail is drawn from interviews with more than 70 former inmates. Many of their descriptions of widespread violence are supported by medical records and photographs, as well as incident reports written by guards and a video that shows guards shocking a man with an electrified vest.\n\nFour former guards, three of whom asked to remain anonymous, also said they had witnessed unjustified beatings by other guards and trusties. Most described the violence as a weekly occurrence.\n\nIn a statement, the department’s attorney, Jason Dare, called the reporting “baseless.” The Rankin County jail, he wrote, “is one of the cleanest and best-run jails in Mississippi, with jailers never having been found to use excessive force in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n\nAfter reviewing the findings, Sean Tindell, the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said on Wednesday that agents from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation had been assigned to investigate the allegations.\n\nSince 2013, at least 11 inmates from the jail have sued the department, alleging that they had been assaulted by guards or trusties. The vast majority represented themselves, and most of the lawsuits were dismissed because of missed deadlines and court fees, or other technicalities.\n\nThe attacks, described in the lawsuits and in interviews with former guards and inmates, ranged in severity from slaps and whippings to brutal beatings that left inmates with bloody wounds and broken bones. Three guards and nearly two dozen former inmates said that trusties and guards would purposefully drag inmates into areas with no surveillance cameras before beating them.\n\nMorgan Curtis, a former trusty who has been in and out of the jail since 2015, said the way guards would order trusties to attack inmates was “like a command to a pack of dogs.”\n\nIn interviews, nine former trusties, most of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation, admitted to helping guards beat inmates. They said the highest-ranking trusties were expected to back up guards during volatile situations or attack inmates so that guards would not have to do so themselves.\n\nThis group of trusties, recognizable by their blue jumpsuits, earned a nickname: the Blue Wave.\n\nOne former trusty described an incident from 2020. He said that on the orders of guards, he beat an inmate who had flooded his cell, kicking him repeatedly.\n\nThe following year, the jail’s top administrator, Barry Vaughn, confronted an inmate who had failed a drug test. Mr. Vaughn punched him so hard, the inmate said, that it broke his nose and knocked out two dental crowns.\n\nChristian Dedmon, one of five former Rankin County deputies who was sentenced to federal prison for torturing two Black men in 2024, said that while he was working at the department he had watched Mr. Vaughn beat inmates in his office. A former guard described seeing several similar beatings. Mr. Vaughn declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nIn 2019, a man who briefly escaped the jail was lifted into the air by his throat and choked by a sheriff’s deputy, several inmates and a guard said. Bryan Bailey, the sheriff of the department, later bragged about the incident, according to Mr. Dedmon.\n\nMr. Dedmon has sent hundreds of emails from a federal prison in New Jersey, describing how his willingness to partake in violence helped him rise through the ranks. He has said that he wanted it known that the brutalities he committed were part of a deeply ingrained culture at the department.\n\nHe previously shared information about the use of taxpayer-funded equipment at Sheriff Bailey’s family farm, allegations that led to an investigation by the state auditor.\n\n“They made me powerful and respected, made me actually feel like somebody, like I had done a good job,” Mr. Dedmon wrote. “It’s OK to beat drug addicts, it’s OK to take from the taxpayer, so why would I not mirror them?”\n\nThe Rankin County Adult Detention Center is tucked behind the courthouse on the main drag of Brandon, a town of about 25,000 people with one of the lowest crime rates in the state.\n\nSeveral hundred inmates, many of them accused of drug crimes and other nonviolent offenses, live in rows of beige cells stacked two stories high. Many have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting their day in court.\n\nOver ten months, reporters examined 69 alleged incidents of violence against inmates at the jail that occurred from 2012 to 2024.\n\nThey included 21 encounters in which guards documented that they had used force against inmates, and why, in incident reports. These reports are routinely filed whenever guards encounter issues. Their descriptions of violence differed greatly from what inmates said had happened.\n\nBut in a number of cases, reporters were able to interview eyewitnesses who supported the accounts of the victims. In several cases, medical records corroborated the injuries that inmates described.\n\nIn the case of Larry Buckhalter, the violence was filmed — by a guard.\n\nIn 2018, Mr. Buckhalter began a one-year sentence for possessing a small amount of cocaine. He was intellectually disabled, his family said, and people often took advantage of him.\n\nAccording to three former guards who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Buckhalter was nicknamed “Crying Larry” by guards and other inmates because he had a habit of pestering jail staff with small requests.\n\nOne day, he asked for a Coca-Cola. A cellphone video obtained by The Times and Mississippi Today shows Mr. Buckhalter sitting quietly in a chair, strapped into a stun vest that is typically used to control violent inmates during court hearings.\n\nOff camera, a man jokes that Mr. Buckhalter is going to bite off his tongue. A woman, who is also off camera, tells Mr. Buckhalter to give his consent.\n\nMr. Buckhalter takes a deep breath. “My name Larry and I volunteer to this,” he says.\n\nThe vest is activated. Mr. Buckhalter screams as his body convulses.\n\n“Now you get a Coke,” the woman says. “It’s all over! I’m so proud of you, Larry!”\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Dare, the department attorney, did not address the guards’ actions. He criticized the reporting as “alleged rumors by unnamed sources who have no personal, first-hand knowledge of events,” and pointed out that reporters had not spoken to Mr. Buckhalter, who died in 2021.\n\nMr. Tindell, Mississippi’s public safety commissioner, called the video “appalling and utterly unacceptable.”\n\nDavid Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that using force can be justified in certain circumstances, like if an inmate poses a threat; but doing so without cause or as punishment, he said, is “categorically inappropriate.” Corporal punishment in U.S. jails and prisons was deemed unconstitutional in the 1960s.\n\nMr. Fathi reviewed several incident reports filed by guards. He said the reasons they cited for using force were so vague that they should have raised red flags to supervisors, and that the justifications fell far short of the typical threshold followed by jails and prisons.\n\nIn one such report, a guard wrote that he had struck an inmate, Dustin Rives, in the face because Mr. Rives had verbally threatened another guard. The blow broke Mr. Rives’s jaw, medical records show. Another report stated that guards struck Carvis Johnson and threw him to the floor in 2020 because he yelled threats and turned toward them after being ordered to face a wall.\n\nFor years, the man in charge of monitoring the jail was Mr. Vaughn, a captain who was recently promoted to undersheriff, making him second-in-command of the sheriff’s department.\n\nAccording to a former deputy, a former guard and 14 former inmates, Mr. Vaughn often beat inmates who broke the rules, slapping and whipping them during interrogations in his office.\n\n“ When you walked through his door, he had a shelf. And on the side of the shelf, he had like a wooden stick, a wooden baseball bat, two or three antennas,” said Cameron Kennedy, a former inmate who said Mr. Vaughn had questioned him on several occasions.\n\nIn June 2021, Mr. Vaughn called Mr. Kennedy and several other trusties who had failed drug tests into his office, one by one.\n\nWhen Mr. Kennedy refused to explain where they had gotten the drugs, he said, Mr. Vaughn slapped him hard enough to give him a black eye.\n\nThree of the other men who had failed drug tests said Mr. Vaughn had punched or whipped them with a car antenna. One of the men was Woodrow Lamont Lewis, the trusty who said Mr. Vaughn had knocked out his dental crowns that day. The men said they also saw other inmates return bloodied and bruised from Mr. Vaughn’s office.\n\nA few months after the failed drug test, Mr. Kennedy was caught with a cellphone, an incident report shows. Mr. Vaughn handcuffed him to a chair and struck his shins and thighs with a car antenna, he said.\n\n“He never did stop,” said Mr. Kennedy. “I’m talking about, like, 10 or 15 minutes, rapping me with it.”\n\nMr. Dedmon, the former deputy who is in prison, wrote in an email that he once saw Mr. Vaughn repeatedly punch an inmate who had smuggled drugs into the jail.\n\nMr. Vaughn directed reporters to speak with the department’s attorney, who denied the allegations.\n\nSome of the country’s first trusty programs began in the early 1900s in Mississippi prisons.\n\nPlaces like Parchman, a notorious prison in the Mississippi Delta, were known to select trusties from among their most violent inmates. The trusties, armed with guns and whips, were tasked with disciplining other inmates or forcing them to perform backbreaking work in cotton fields.\n\nA federal court ruling in 1972 deemed trusty-on-prisoner violence unconstitutional, leading to the widespread dismantling of the programs in prisons across the nation.\n\nToday, modern versions of trusty programs are common in county jails, though participants are generally banned from using physical force. These programs put nonviolent offenders to work, helping them learn job skills.\n\nIn Rankin County, many former trusties spoke glowingly about the program, crediting it with turning their lives around.\n\n“It was the biggest blessing in my life,” said Cameron McKenzie, a former trusty. “I’ve been out now 20 months. I’m married, got full custody of both my kids, just bought a house, good job, you name it.”\n\nMany inmates in the county jail are there only for short periods, while they await sentencing, but trusties usually serve their entire sentence in the facility, rising through the ranks over months or even years.\n\nThe most senior trusties — those who earn blue suits — have far better living conditions than other inmates. Former trusties said they slept in their own cellblock, in unlocked cells, and sometimes got passes to visit their families.\n\nMany could roam the facility freely, play video games and work outside the jail. One former trusty, Cameron McCaskill, said he was allowed to keep a pet dog and order pizza.\n\n“A blue suit is unrestricted,” Sheriff Bailey said during a 2020 interview with a Mississippi lobbying group. “Once they get a blue suit status, that is almost like being an employee here.”\n\nMr. Dare said trusties were not allowed to use force.\n\n“ I do not believe that is specifically spelled out in a policy,” he said in an interview. “I do know it is a practice that trusties do not go hands-on.”\n\nBut several former guards and participants of the program said that the jail staff expected some trusties to provide extra muscle in exchange for their privileges.\n\n“ If something is going on with the officer and they need assistance, you need to be there,” said Mr. Lewis, the former trusty. “If you ain’t there to help them, whether they are winning or losing, then you already know you’re next.”\n\nThree others said trusties were rewarded, sometimes with “free world” food, for joining the violence.\n\n“People would do just about anything for a cigarette, or a box of Church’s chicken with a honey biscuit,” said Phillip Smith, a former trusty. “That was the motivation of the Blue Wave.”\n\nDozens of former inmates, including many who participated in the program, said they had witnessed trusties hitting or kicking other inmates, or holding them down while guards beat them.\n\nOf the 11 inmates who have sued the sheriff’s department since 2013, five said in their lawsuits that trusties attacked them with guards. All but one had their lawsuits dismissed.\n\nCarvis Johnson, an inmate who had a long history of disciplinary infractions, claimed in a 2020 lawsuit that he had been beaten by guards and trusties. Court records show that Mr. Johnson settled his lawsuit, but the department declined to provide further details about the settlement.\n\nIncident reports show that a confrontation began after Mr. Johnson shoved feces under his cell door and broke a sprinkler, flooding his cell. Trusties were brought in to clean up the mess. Guards led Mr. Johnson out of his cell and knocked him to the floor after he verbally threatened them, the reports show.\n\nIn an interview, Brock Reed, a former trusty, said a guard told a group of trusties to give Mr. Johnson “a sample” and that they should beat him because they would be the ones stuck cleaning up his mess.\n\nMr. Reed said the guards led Mr. Johnson to a corner widely known for being a camera blind spot. A supervisor’s routine review of the incident confirmed that there was no security camera footage of what happened, in part because “hallway camera does not show where inmate was in the hall.”\n\nWhen Mr. Johnson hit the floor, Mr. Reed kicked him in the hip and lower back, he said.\n\n“I wasn’t going to be the one trusty to tell the police, ‘No, I’m not doing this,’” he said. “I know how they look at you for that.”\n\nChristopher Mack, a former inmate, sued the department last year, claiming that trusties and guards beat him in 2021. When he made bail and left the jail with twin black eyes the next day, Mr. Mack said, Sheriff Bailey approached him and asked who had caused his injuries.\n\n“ I looked at him and said, ‘Mr. Bailey, you know who did this to me, your officers and trusties did this to me,’” Mr. Mack said.\n\nThe sheriff cursed under his breath, Mr. Mack said, and stormed off.\n\nIn September 2019, William Keith Richards found out what could happen to trusties who took advantage of their freedom.\n\nMr. Richards, a blue-suit, had nearly completed his sentence when he walked out of the jail one Friday. Officials did not notice he was gone until he missed church that Sunday, an incident report shows.\n\nWhen Mr. Richards was caught, other blue-suit trusties were ordered to gather at a garage entrance of the jail, where Sheriff Bailey berated them for not informing guards of the escape, four former trusties said in interviews.\n\nSheriff Bailey told the trusties that they should take a good look at Mr. Richards, because he was the reason they were about to lose their special privileges, two of them said.\n\nMr. Richards was escorted back to the jail by Deputy Wes Shivers, a 6-foot-8 former U.F.C. fighter. After they arrived, Mr. Shivers lifted the inmate into the air by his throat and choked him, said two former trusties and a former guard. In an interview, Mr. Shivers confirmed that he had returned Mr. Richards to the jail but denied choking him.\n\nIt is unclear whether Sheriff Bailey saw the incident or when he left the room. Mr. Shivers said he could not recall whether the sheriff was nearby when he arrived with Mr. Richards.\n\nA group of guards and trusties dragged Mr. Richards into the jail’s dressing room, which was known to not have cameras, and beat him, according to four former inmates familiar with the incident.\n\nThey saw Mr. Richards in the days following, and said his face was swollen and his neck was ringed with bruises.\n\n“They did a number on him,” Mr. Reed said.\n\nMr. Richards declined to comment for this article, citing fears for his safety. Mr. Bailey declined a request to comment, deferring to the department’s attorney. In a statement, Mr. Dare, who called the reporting “baseless,” did not address whether Mr. Bailey was present during the incident.\n\nThe department did not produce reports detailing Mr. Richards’s capture despite repeated requests.\n\nDuring email exchanges with reporters, Mr. Dedmon recounted the sheriff bragging to him and others about how Mr. Shivers had choked an inmate who had escaped.\n\n“Bailey used to talk about it,” Mr. Dedmon wrote. “I can just remember Bailey saying, ‘Wes held him up against the wall with one hand.’”\n\nThe Times and Mississippi Today obtained formal grievance documents from lawyers who sued the department, providing a rare window into how jail officials handled inmate complaints. From 2018 to 2022, eight inmates filed grievances that described assaults by guards or trusties.\n\nIn 2022, Mr. Rives, the inmate whose jaw was broken by a guard, filed a grievance. Jail incident reports show that after Mr. Rives was struck, guards strapped him into a restraint chair overnight and then locked him in an isolation cell for 25 days. It was there where he filed his grievance, saying he had not been taken to the hospital. His jaw was infected by the time he was hospitalized and required surgery, according to medical records.\n\n“ It never healed,” he said. “ If I take a bite out of a hamburger, it’ll lock up and pop and grind like you wouldn’t believe.”\n\nA report from Mr. Rives’s grievance file shows that a supervisor closed his complaint three days after it had been filed, saying the department had documented the incident and provided a “satisfactory response,” which included scheduling a hospital visit for Mr. Rives and informing him that he could not press criminal charges against the guard while incarcerated.\n\nMr. Rives said the department did not contact him again.\n\nThe report does not indicate whether the guard who broke Mr. Rives’s jaw, Jordan McQueary, was disciplined or questioned about the incident. Mr. Rives is among at least nine inmates who have filed complaints or federal lawsuits claiming they were assaulted by Mr. McQueary, who still works at the department.\n\nLast year, the department honored Mr. McQueary for his “outstanding” work.\n\nHe did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt least six other grievances were closed under similar circumstances, with no indication that the guards or trusties accused of violence were interviewed or disciplined.\n\nSupervisors also listed “satisfactory response” as the reason for closing three other complaints. The forms do not define the term, and department representatives did not respond to requests for clarification.\n\nTwo former trusties who spoke to The Times and Mississippi Today about their experiences said they have since been confronted by jail officials about their interviews.\n\nJohn Phillips, a former trusty who said he witnessed and participated in violence between 2017 and 2021, was brought back to the Rankin County jail in August to face new criminal charges.\n\nWhile there, he was taken to Mr. Vaughn’s office, where Mr. Vaughn and Mr. Dare questioned him about what he had told the publications.\n\nMr. Phillips then wrote and signed a statement contradicting the comments he had made to reporters. His lawyer was not present during the meeting, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Dare said.\n\n“I never seen anything that the news reporters are talking about when spoken about inmates on inmates or the Blue Wave,” the statement reads, according to a copy provided by Mr. Dare. “There is no wrong doing at the Rankin jail or in the program.”\n\nIn a later interview, Mr. Phillips stressed that his statements to reporters had been true, and that he had felt pressured by the officials to write the letter. Mr. Dare said he had not pressured Mr. Phillips. He provided a recording of a portion of the August interaction in which Mr. Phillips says he is giving his statement voluntarily.\n\nMr. Dare said that he had collected similar statements from several other former trusties, but he declined to share their names.\n\n“I sit down and try to meet with folks, figure out what they know,” he said in an interview last month. “I’m trying to defend the trusty program, that’s all.”\n\nThis article was supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the Alicia Patterson Foundation.\n\nThis story was co-reported by Steph Quinn.

the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSome of the documents mention Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles; US President Donald Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment, who highlight the extent of Epstein's contact book.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in about 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nHere are some of the the other names that came up, which does not indicate wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.\n\nMichael Wolff, 72, is an American journalist and columnist - as well as a prolific author of books on the wealthy and the famous.\n\nFire and Fury, the first of several books spanning Trump's first stint as US president, came out in 2018, with descriptions of a dysfunctional White House and salacious details about the US commander-in-chief. Trump said it was \"full of lies\".\n\nThe new batch of files related to Jeffrey Epstein shed light on a relationship that appears to indicate a correspondence between Wolff and the late convicted sex offender.\n\nAttention has focused particularly on one of the emails, in which Wolff appears to give Epstein advice in relation to Trump, as Trump was campaigning for the White House for the first time.\n\nWolff wrote to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN was planning to ask Trump, as a presidential candidate, about his relationship with Epstein.\n\nEpstein replied: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"\n\nThe two go on to discuss a strategy, with Wolff writing: \"I think you should let him hang himself.\"\n\nIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.\n\nResponding to the release in a video posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.\n\nIn fact, Wolff disclosed before the latest presidential election in the US that he had interviewed Epstein \"periodically\" for Fire and Fury - and released tapes of those conversations.\n\nThe documents include correspondences between Epstein and Larry Summers, who was former Democratic President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary. It had been previously reported that the two men knew each other.\n\nThe emails indicate the two met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"presidnt [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".\n\nIn a separate email from late November 2016, just after Trump's election, Summers asked Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".\n\nDue to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin proximity\" and a \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".\n\nA spokesperson for Summers declined to comment, but referred the BBC to past statements by Summers. A representative told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 that the former official \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\".\n\nThe House of Representatives Oversight Committee released several email exchanges between Epstein and Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer who served as White House counsel during the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nIn August 2018, Ms Ruemmler and Epstein discussed hush-money payments made by Trump to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election - an issue over which Trump was later convicted of falsifying business records. Trump denies allegations that he had an affair with Daniels.\n\nThe exchange between Ms Ruemmler and Epstein culminated with Epstein writing: \"You see, I know how dirty donald is.\"\n\nThe bank Goldman Sachs, where Ms Ruemmler is currently chief legal officer and general counsel, told CNBC it was standing by its employee.\n\n\"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs. Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Goldman spokesperson Tony Fratto said in a statement to  CNBC.\n\nIn 2023, Ms Ruemmler  told the Wall Street Journal,  \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\nThe BBC has asked Ms Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs for further comment.\n\nThe name of billionaire investor and on-off Trump supporter Peter Thiel appeared again in the latest Epstein documents - having first been mentioned in a batch made public in September.\n\nAccording to the newly-released files, Epstein wrote to Mr Thiel in November 2018 to invite him to visit him in his Caribbean island, where some of Epstein's crimes are thought to have been committed.\n\nThe BBC has asked the Thiel Foundation and the investor's Founders Fund for comment. A representative for Mr Thiel told Politico that he had never visited the island.\n\nMr Thiel was critical of Epstein on an August 2024 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\n\n\"You know, I met Epstein a few times as well,\" Thiel said.\n\nMr Thiel said he was introduced to Epstein by another Silicon Valley executive in 2014.\n\n\"I didn't check, didn't ask any - enough questions about it,\" Mr Thiel said. He surmised that \"Epstein knew a lot about taxes\".\n\nThe latest document drop includes more correspondence between the famed linguist Noam Chomsky, 96, and Epstein. Many of their discussions were academic or personal.\n\nOccasionally the conversations turned to the subject of Trump, including in December 2016.\n\nIn his email, Mr Chomsky tells Epstein: \"I notice your prediction was right about Trump avoiding the White House as far too primitive.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted a representative of Mr Chomsky for comment.\n\nIn responses to previous reporting by the Wall Street Journal on their relationship, Mr Chomsky said Epstein had helped him move money between his accounts without \"one penny from Epstein\", and to acknowledge that \"I knew him and we met occasionally\".\n\nEpstein consulted publicist Peggy Siegal as the scandal around him and his associates unfolded.\n\nEpstein wrote to Ms Siegal in 2011 asking her to contact the founder of the Huffington Post, Ariana Huffington, in order to discredit the story of Virginia Giuffre, who was a prominent accuser of Epstein and Andrew. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.\n\nEpstein told Siegal that Huffington \"should champion the dangers of false allegations...\".\n\nThe email exchange shows Ms Siegal telling Epstein: \"If you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Ariana Huffington from me…\".\n\nIn a phone interview, Ms Siegal told the BBC she had never passed Epstein's request to Huffington. \"I did not call Ariana,\" she said. Huffington \"used to publish my writing and there's no reason in the world I would jeopardise that relationship,\" Ms Siegal added.\n\nBut the fact that Epstein had asked was \"not unusual. It was a ridiculous request,\" she said.\n\n\"Jeffrey had a habit of trying to ensnare people into his delusional world,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Huffington told Politico she was \"was never contacted and never sent a reporter\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620qppzlgwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:33:18.710+00:00","title":"US-South Korea nuclear submarine deal: What does it mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States and South Korea have finalized a strategic defense agreement to jointly build nuclear-powered attack submarines, with the U.S. approving the program and committing to cooperation on fuel sourcing.

2025-11-16T13:33:18.710+00:00\n\nTitle: US-South Korea nuclear submarine deal: What does it mean?\n\nSouth Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States.\n\nThe US has approved the \"attack submarines\" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the agreement.\n\nThe agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding.\n\nIn a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had \"given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel\".\n\nIn an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha.\n\nOnly six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India.\n\nSouth Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster.\n\n\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nSouth Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure.\n\nAnd so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports.\n\nThe latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme.\n\nPresident Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose.\n\nIn a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a \"proud achievement\" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North.\n\nThe stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"awake at night\", he added.\n\nNorth Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials.\n\nIn March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard.\n\nPyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years.\n\nNorth Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme.\n\nJo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race.\n\n\"North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,\" she told the BBC. \"[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension.\"\n\nIt is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts.\n\nYang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat.\n\n\"South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,\" Dr Yang said. \"What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines.\"\n\nDr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.\n\nJo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a \"major change\" which \"means South Korea is now a regional player\".\n\n\"The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,\" she said. \"It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries.\"\n\nFor Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China.\n\n\"Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,\" Dr Yang explained. \"South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea.\"\n\nUS and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing must be \"furious\" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said.\n\nFollowing the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would \"deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides\".\n\nDai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that \"the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive\".\n\nAlthough President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline.\n\nSouth Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did \"not have the capability\" to build such vessels, according to reports.\n\nHanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter.\n\nBut now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43vx0rrwvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"00:29:01.678+00:00","title":"Patronato: My mum was a 17-year-old free spirit in Franco's Spain - so she was locked up and put in a coma","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mariona Roca Tort, a woman raised under Franco’s regime, was arrested at 17 for her involvement in anti-authoritarian activism and sent to a reformatory under the Patronato de Protección a la Mujer system.

Girls who'd been sexually assaulted were incarcerated, assuming the blame for their own abuse. Orphans and abandoned girls might also find themselves living behind convent walls.\n\nMarina and her cousins were stunned.\n\nThey couldn't comprehend that their grandparents had arranged to have their own daughter locked up.\n\nMariona's memory of telling this story to the youngsters in her family is blurred, she believes as a result of the psychiatric \"treatment\" she was forced to undergo at the reformatory. But Marina didn't forget the revelations, and years later, she would make a documentary telling her mother's story.\n\nMariona is a survivor of the Patronato de Protección a la Mujer - the Women's Protection Board. Under dictator Francisco Franco, it oversaw a nationwide network of residential institutions managed by religious organisations. There's no definitive information about how many institutions were involved or how many girls were affected.\n\nThursday will mark 50 years since Franco's death. Spain has since seen a revolution in women's rights - but survivors of the Patronato are still waiting for answers and are now demanding an inquiry.\n\nWarning: This article contains content that some readers might find distressing\n\nMariona, the oldest of nine siblings, describes her parents as right-wing and ultra-Catholic. They were so conservative they wouldn't even let Mariona wear trousers.\n\nBut in 1968, when she turned 16, a new world unfolded.\n\nMariona was tutoring children during the day, and preparing for university at evening classes. There, she says, she met people she'd never encountered before - trade unionists, left-wingers and anti-Franco activists. It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights. The spirit of revolt was infectious.\n\nFranco had been in power for three decades. Political parties were banned, censorship was universal and young people wanted change. Soon, Mariona joined her new friends on \"raids\": a few of them would block off a street, throw Molotov cocktails, hand out leaflets, and when the police turned up, scatter in every direction.\n\nOn May Day 1969, one of Mariona's friends was arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona. There was a risk the detainee would give names to the police - so Mariona couldn't go home, in case they came looking for her. That night she stayed in the flat of a fellow activist.\n\nReturning home the next day, Mariona was in deep trouble. Her parents were furious, and began to exert far more control over her life.\n\n\"For them, it was a scandal, a stain on the family,\" she says. \"After that, they wouldn't let me out.\"\n\nBy the end of that summer, Mariona had resolved to leave home, and travelled to the holiday island of Menorca with some college friends, leaving her parents a note.\n\nThey immediately reported her as an underage runaway to the authorities, and the moment Mariona was about to board a boat back to Barcelona, she was arrested.\n\nAt the port in Barcelona her parents met her.\n\nThey didn't take her home. Instead, they took her to a convent. Mariona wasn't given any explanation - she only remembers her parents' rage.\n\nDays later she flew to Madrid with her father. There, she was driven directly to another convent, part of the Patronato system, under Spain's Ministry of Justice.\n\nShe and the other interned women were categorised and segregated.\n\nMariona says she ended up on the first floor - reserved for \"the rebellious ones - the ones they considered fallen women\".\n\nThe Patronato had the power to detain any non-conforming woman under 25. They weren't criminals - they were females deemed in need of \"re-education\".  But Mariona never learned the stories of the others she was confined with.\n\n\"They didn't let us talk.  It's quite incredible,\" she says. \"And you wonder, how did they manage it?\"\n\nThe internees were only allowed to exchange simple greetings with each other - a form of control, and a way of preventing \"bad\" girls influencing others.\n\n\"What you couldn't do was really get to know another girl,\"  says Mariona. \"Because then they'd separate you - send one of you to a different dormitory, or even to another institution.\"\n\nShe thinks there were around 100 internees at the convent. They slept 20 to a room, with a nun at one end, and the door locked. The daily routine was gruelling - prayers, Mass, cleaning the convent, and then hours in a workshop making clothes for local retailers. While the girls sewed, a nun read aloud so that no-one talked.\n\n\"There was indoctrination,\" recalls Mariona. \"So that you should understand you'd behaved very badly. Then once you realised this, you'd ask for forgiveness and confess.\"\n\nMariona never confessed.\n\nAfter around four months, she was allowed to return home to Barcelona for Christmas, but wasn't permitted to go out alone. Somehow - and Mariona doesn't remember how - she managed to escape, but her escape was short lived. Within hours she was bundled into a car with her father and an uncle, and driven back to Madrid.\n\n\"We arrived back at the convent at dusk,\" she recalls. \"I refused to go in. They pulled me up the stairs and gave me a sedative to get me inside.\"\n\nInside the convent, the other young women were warned against talking to her - the rebel girl who had the nerve to try to run away. She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.\n\nDramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called \"insulin coma therapy\".\n\nMariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow \"re-set\" a patient's brain.\n\nIt was a \"therapy\" that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.\n\nMariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she'd be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.\n\n\"Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, 'I hurt my parents,'\" she says.\n\n\"I entered this process of submission and acceptance.\"\n\nMariona believes the forced, intravenous \"treatment\" with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina's documentary about her mother's experience.\n\nDoctors believed the \"treatment\" would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn't happening.\n\n\"One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate.\"\n\nMariona's despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she'd be released from the clinic.\n\nMariona succeeded. In 1972, once she'd grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.\n\nNow aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.\n\nThese were the final years of Franco's dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.\n\nAt some point, Mariona asked her mother why she'd been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: \"We made a mistake.\"\n\nMariona's father is in his 90s now.\n\n\"We suffered a lot too,\" he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.\n\nFor Marina, learning more about her mother's story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.\n\n\"I can't force myself to love someone who's caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly.\"\n\nThe short documentary Marina produced about her mother's experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for \"the spaces\" - a reference to the blanks in Mariona's memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.\n\nFifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain's dictatorship.

neighborhoods across the Charlotte, N.C., area on Saturday, the first day of an operation that has already drawn significant criticism over its aggressive tactics.\n\nAn immigrant rights group said it was the largest single-day tally for immigrant arrests in the state’s recent history.\n\nThe operation has startled people in one of the fastest growing cities in the country, whose growth in recent years has been spurred by international migration, especially from Latin America. The Border Patrol agents fanned out across immigrant neighborhoods once again on Sunday, prompting many businesses that cater to immigrants to close for now.\n\nA flea market that is typically filled with Hispanic vendors was canceled this weekend. Nightclubs in the city that play reggaeton music on Saturday nights decided not to open. Catholic churches were unusually empty on Sunday morning; immigrant advocates said that federal agents were present outside church parking lots.\n\nGregory Bovino, the leader of the Border Patrol operation in Charlotte, who also led agents in Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year, has already declared the North Carolina mission to be a success. He posted photos on social media of five detained people who he said had criminal histories.\n\nNeither Mr. Bovino, who is from western North Carolina, nor the Department of Homeland Security has said exactly how many of the 81 people arrested on Saturday had criminal histories.\n\nFew of the hundreds of people who were arrested in the Chicago and Los Angeles operations had serious criminal backgrounds. But the Trump administration has said that it considers anyone who is present in the United States without legal status to be a criminal, and have used that view to justify its enforcement operations.\n\nIn Charlotte, lawyers and immigrant advocacy groups said a familiar pattern appeared to be emerging there as well. The people who were arrested or approached by agents on Saturday, they said, included a man participating in a church cleanup day, workers at a Home Depot, a landscaper putting up Christmas decorations and a Hispanic U.S. citizen whose truck window was shattered by an agent.\n\n“This is a day of shame,” said Nikki Marín Baena, co-director of Siembra NC, an immigrant advocacy group. “It’s a shameful day for the North Carolina Republican Party, who hailed the arrival of so-called law enforcement officers carrying out terrorist operations, and echoed Greg Bovino’s talking points about ‘going after criminals.’”\n\nSiembra NC said that before Saturday, the largest numbers of immigrant arrests in the state in single days were 30 people in June and 27 in February 2019.\n\nOn Saturday, Matt Mercer, a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, said: “We’re grateful to see these brave men and women in federal law enforcement following through on President Trump’s promise to remove violent criminal illegals from our country and those stoking fear about these targeted operations must stop at once.”\n\nOfficials in Charlotte and in Mecklenburg County, which includes the city, had been bracing for Mr. Bovino’s operation this week, and had warned residents who wished to protest to do so peacefully and not allow the agents’ presence to provoke them. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, expressed concern about the agents’ arrival, saying in a statement that “when we see injustice, we bear witness.”\n\n“If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe long after these federal agents leave,” Mr. Stein said. “That’s the North Carolina way.”\n\nThe arrival of Border Patrol in Charlotte, a moderately Democratic city known for its booming banking industry, has puzzled many people in the state. Federal law limits the Border Patrol’s focus to the country’s 6,000 miles of international borders and a zone extending about 100 miles inland from the borders and the coastline. But Charlotte is nowhere near the Mexican border, and is about 170 miles from the nearest point on the coast.\n\nIt remains unclear how long the operation in Charlotte will last. The federal agents are expected to head next to New Orleans. Mayor Esther Manheimer of Asheville, N.C., said on Friday that her city may also become a target in the future.\n\nThis is a developing story. It will be updated.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27z4pvlz1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"08:31:12.959+00:00","title":"Move over açaí - the Amazon has more 'superfoods' to offer","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil is promoting a sustainable bioeconomy by developing and commercializing Amazonian superfoods such as cupuaçu, taperebá, and bacaba as part of its climate strategy during COP30.

a churning, brown river in Belém, Brazil, machines are pulping candidates for the next global \"superfood\".\n\nCupuaçu... Taperebá... Bacaba... Like açaí berries - these fruits are rich in antioxidants, fibre or fatty acids.\n\nIf Brazil has its way, they could soon be popping up on your social media feeds and being sold in fashionable cafes in the UK, Europe and the US.\n\nIt's part of a bold plan by the country, which is hosting the COP30 UN climate talks, to tackle climate change, protect nature and create wealth in the face of considerable regional poverty.\n\n\"There's a lot of superfoods in the forest that people don't know,\" says Max Petrucci, founder of a local company Mahta that sells powdered cacao and Brazil nuts for shakes.\n\nThe drink he gives me to try is gritty and tastes like chocolate without sugar.\n\n\"We're focussed first on nutrition and the health benefits that these Amazonian ingredients provide,\" he explains.\n\nBut the second benefit, he explains, is \"social and environmental\". He says they pay fair prices and only buy from farmers who practice sustainable farming.\n\nIt sounds like a marketing pitch and the company's slick packaging promises \"ancestral ingredients\" and the \"power of purple fruits from the forest\".\n\nScientific research into the benefits of \"superfoods\" is limited, but  eating Amazonian fruits is generally recognised to be good for you.\n\nLarissa Bueno, also at Mahta, explains that they only sell powdered foods - \"similar to Huel in the UK,\" she says.\n\nTransporting raw fruits that degrade within days of picking is expensive. But if companies freeze dry ingredients into powders to sell to supermarkets or ship abroad, \"it keeps more of the nutritional value and it's a smart way to keep more economic value in Brazil\", she explains.\n\nThe lab in Belém's Bioeconomy Park is helping small companies test new ways of preserving fruits.\n\n\"People have been eating from these forests for more than 10,000 years. There are many, many, many undiscovered superfoods, \" Max says.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest, which covers 6 million sq km (2.3 million sq miles), has always been full of natural wealth. But for decades its vast ecosystem has been decaying, with areas chopped down to sell timber or clear space for cattle or crops like soy.\n\nThis damaged one of the earth's great protections against climate change - trees that soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide.\n\nUnusually,  more than two-thirds of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions come from land use and agriculture , rather than energy like most countries. Those emissions mainly stem from cutting down forest or growing vast amounts of food.\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to halve deforestation by 2030. In the 12 months to July 2025, rates reached an 11-year low.\n\nBut the forest is a resource. The nearly 30 million people living in the Amazon region, and across Brazil, need and want to make a living.\n\nBrazil is pushing the idea of building a prospering economy by sustainably using natural resources, preserving nature to protect the vitality of the land, and developing valuable products including fuels, pharmaceuticals, and foods.\n\nBuilding this \"bio-economy\" features strongly in its national climate action plan.\n\nSarah Sampaio runs a small coffee company that grows coffee beans in the shadow of trees, using a method called agroforesty - or agriculture that helps cultivate forests.\n\nShe works with around 200 farming families in the Apui region, which has one of the highest rates of deforestation.\n\n\"We plant native Amazonian trees and the coffee together. The trees shade the coffee plants and farmers can also grow their own food around those plants,\" she says.\n\n\"When the coffee plant dies, the trees remain as the forest, so it's helping to restore the Amazon.\"\n\nThe fresh brew I'm given has a light, fruity taste, and she's proud that three of her coffees were selected among the 30 best in Brazil in the national Coffee of the Year competition.\n\n\"If we want to stop more trees from being chopped down, we have to provide people with an alternative income, a sustainable way of living,\" Sarah says.\n\nWhatever the next Amazonian superfood is, it will need to challenge açaí. The purple berry is grown and eaten in huge quantities in northern Brazil and sold for nearly £10 ($13) per smoothie bowl in parts of London.\n\nDamien Benoit sells açaí ice cream in Europe. \"It's very high in antioxidants, in fibres and unsaturated fatty acids, and in different minerals that make it very popular among people who do sports,\" he says.\n\nHe works with families who keeps four hectares of açai plants in the forest \"with a minimum number of species per hectare that must be monitored.\"\n\n\"We make sure children go to school, and gender equality is a huge topic for us,\" he claims.\n\nOn their own, these small companies cannot feed millions of people and, so far, they've prospered due to grants or capital from charities and funds that invest in companies aimed at protecting nature.\n\nAnd there are questions around how much they can be scaled up.\n\nIf açaí production was expanded into many industrial-size plantations, it could start to cause exactly the same problems that people like Damien are trying to solve.\n\nBut there's a reason the word \"bioeconomy\" is plastered all over the UN climate talks.\n\n\"We need to move from a world dependent on fossil fuels - that is clear,\" says Ana Yang, Director of the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House.\n\n\"And if we don't have solutions that are bio-based, we will not be able to do that,\" she says.\n\nThis is by no means a magic bullet solution to the problem of how to replace fossil fuels with clean energy and use the land in a way that protects nature.\n\nBrazil has also promised a four-fold increase in the use of biofuels, which can be controversial, by 2035. Biofuels such as ethanol are often touted as a replacement for fossil fuels, but they can lead to deforestation as demand increases for the crop to burn to make the fuel.\n\nSome are concerned this will lead to the unsustainable extraction of timber or sugarcane to export abroad and burn, and the theft of indigenous peoples' land.\n\nMs Yang says it's essential to put safeguards like strong regulation in place.\n\n\"Not all bio-based transitions are good,\" she says.\n\n\"If they lead to destruction of natural habitat or they don't have good social practices, then it isn't solving the original problem.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/james-watson-dna.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"09:00:04-05:00","title":"James Watson Saw the True Form of DNA.

Then It Blinded Him.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T09:00:04-05:00\n\nAt first, James Watson terrified me. It was 1991 and my first day as the new science writer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. My boss’s boss was Dr. Watson, the venerable scientist who codiscovered the double helix form of DNA. He greeted me as though he had just remembered that I was supposed to tell him something, “Oh! Nate … ” He looked me in the eye, shook my hand, then stared just over my head, as if checking whether someone more interesting was coming in.\n\nI worked at Cold Spring Harbor for four years. Although I never became close to Dr. Watson, my fear of him abated, mostly. I saw that when he was not performing a public role, he was generally soft-spoken and thoughtful, if stubborn. He had an unnerving habit of answering my questions with a seeming non sequitur. I’d look baffled, he’d fidget and I would at last understand that his response was three steps downfield from where my mind’s eye had been looking.\n\nNear the end of my time at Cold Spring Harbor, I remember seeing Dr. Watson walking around the campus, brandishing a copy of Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein’s new book “The Bell Curve,” which notoriously argued that I.Q. differences between racial groups are genetic. At the time, I don’t recall race having been something Dr. Watson talked about in public (nor had I heard him speak of it in private). That changed drastically after the turn of the century. Jim being Jim, the more the public pressed him not to say those things, the more he said them. It was perverse but predictable. Eventually, his dogged insistence on a connection between race and intelligence cost him his reputation as a scientist and his relationship with his beloved Cold Spring Harbor, one of the great loves of his life.\n\nDNA giveth and DNA taketh away. Dr. Watson, who died on Nov. 6, had built his stratospheric career on his total commitment to DNA and molecular biology, which resulted in a Nobel Prize and leadership of the Human Genome Project. DNA made him one of the most significant scientists of the 20th century. But getting carried away with it, insisting against the science and history that it was meaningful to compare I.Q. between races, made him among the most infamous of the 21st.\n\nGenetic determinism is one of those one-single-technofix-will-solve-everything ideas that visionaries can fall prey to, and the history of genetics is lousy with hereditarians promising to end disease, make us smarter and better our society. We’re drawn to magic bullet solutions that cannot solve complex social problems. It is all too easy for someone who makes a genuinely profound discovery to think they have found the secret of life, or the environment, or disease.\n\nIronically, Dr. Watson’s preoccupation with genetic determinism was far from predetermined. Some of his contemporaries began entertaining eugenics ideas in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and called for deeper studies into claims that I.Q. measured human intelligence and varied across different races. But Dr. Watson stayed out of this eugenics boomlet, even after becoming director of Cold Spring Harbor in 1968.\n\nSo what changed? Why did he later become receptive to ideas he had once found repugnant?\n\nRecombinant DNA happened. DNA sequencing happened. The Human Genome Project happened. Like scientists before him, Dr. Watson got carried away by a pretty but simplistic model of the gene that seemed able to explain everything. He had been interested in the gene all his adult life. But by the time he became head of the Human Genome Project, he identified with it. Through the 1980s and ’90s, DNA motifs were incorporated into the fabric of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory — from outdoor sculpture to a 65-foot-tall bell tower.\n\nDNA also became personal. When his older son developed mental illness, Dr. Watson would repeatedly say that he found comfort in the idea that his son merely got a bad roll of the “genetic dice.” Dr. Watson shared this notion with many other families living with genetic illness. On some level, if something is “in your genes,” you’re absolved, it’s not your fault. In this way, genetic determinism is like astrology. Indeed, Dr. Watson himself once said: “We used to think our fate was in our stars. Now we know, in large measure, our fate is in our genes.”\n\nAn obsession with the gene, of course, is not a complete explanation for why racist ideas resonated with Dr. Watson — who was bourgeois, Anglophiliac and Eurocentric, proudly elitist and rather fond of the mid-1950s patriarchy. For “The Bell Curve” to strike such a chord, some part of him had to already be receptive to its arguments.\n\nAn overweening faith that our genes make us who we are is a terrifying thing. If you think there is one single fundamental essence that makes you you more than anything else, you’re at risk. Though genetic determinism doesn’t necessarily make you a racist, it might move you to support forced sterilization, found a Nobel Prize winner sperm bank, have 17 children or commit other eugenic acts. Exactly what form it takes in any one case depends on culture, family, temperament — even, a little, your genes.\n\nNathaniel Comfort is a professor of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University and a fellow of the Center for Science, Technology, Medicine and Society at the University of California, Berkeley.

Why Are They Facing Foreclosure?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T05:01:26-05:00\n\nQ: We borrowed $218,000 from a company called World Business Lenders and paid back more than $240,000 — but they said we still owe $200,000. This happened during Covid, when our business was shut down. When we couldn’t pay, they said they would take our house. This was a predatory loan, part of a rent-a-bank scheme. We need help, otherwise we will lose our family home of 60 years.\n\n— Fred Urban, Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nFred Urban’s situation is a classic study in how borrowers living in states like New York, which have consumer protections that cap interest rates, can still become entangled in loans carrying predatory rates, often with devastating consequences.\n\nMr. Urban, 58, and his wife own a German restaurant in Brooklyn called Schnitzel Haus. Just before the pandemic, they took out a loan with an interest rate that can both strain the eyes and play tricks with your mind: “0.147945205479 percent per day.” Multiply that by 365 days, and you arrive at their true interest rate — nearly 54 percent. But their loan documents didn’t describe it that way.\n\nIn New York, interest rates on many consumer loans are generally capped at 16 percent, and charging more than 25 percent can lead to criminal usury charges (there are some exceptions). So how could the Urbans end up with a rate that’s double that? Through what is known as a rent-a-bank scheme.\n\nHere is how the scheme typically works: The borrower, often someone who is financially distressed or has a weak credit profile, applies for a loan through a nonbank lender. To bypass state interest rate caps, the nonbank lender will partner with (or “rent”) a chartered bank in another state. The chartered bank is generally free to “export” the higher rates permitted in its home state. The bank typically sells most (or all) of the loan right back to the nonbank that initiated the deal.\n\nWho is the true lender in this situation? We’ll come back to that.\n\nIn 2019, the Urbans inherited Mr. Urban’s family home of about 60 years, in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. It needed work, and they decided to take out a loan for the renovations, which they thought they could also use for their restaurant and to help their then 26-year-old son expand his own small business.\n\nMr. Urban said that they had wanted to borrow $100,000 to $150,000, but the loan brokers, who were securing a loan through the New Jersey-based World Business Lenders, pressured the couple to take out a larger loan, for $218,000. The brokers told the couple they would help them settle the loan, which was taken through their restaurant business, within six months — and the Urbans trusted them because they had used these brokers for business loans in the past.\n\nThey were also preoccupied. Just as the Urbans were finalizing the agreement, their lives were upended. Their son had a serious seizure in early April 2020, caused by undiagnosed epilepsy, and was declared brain dead. He remained on life support for a few days as his family arranged to donate his organs, just as the global pandemic was unfolding and businesses in New York were shuttered.\n\nThe loan brokers “were relentless to get us to close,” Mr. Urban said. “They called when we were in the hospital, texted all day long to see if we signed paperwork. We asked to be left alone at the time, but they continued to harass us to get it done.”\n\nWhat they signed remains a blur. He hadn’t realized, he said in an interview, that his house was being used as collateral. “If I would have known,” Mr. Urban added, “I would have never done this loan.”\n\nThey had misgivings after the first month, and wanted to give the money back. But the prepayment penalties, which Mr. Urban recalls being roughly $80,000, were too steep. They were on the hook for two years of payments — interest only for the first year — and a giant balloon payment at the end.\n\nThey initially owed $2,257 weekly to World Business Lenders, but it would ultimately be a chartered partner bank, Axos, that would file for foreclosure on their home after they fell short on payments. Their restaurant remained open — offering takeout, deliveries and outdoor seating — but the pandemic business declined, and the couple still had to borrow from family, wipe out their savings and take out “merchant cash advances” to make their payments to World Business.\n\nWorld Business Lenders did modify the loan several times when the Urbans missed payments, adding the arrears to the balance. But it sent them a default letter in July 2022, and demanded they immediately pay the entire loan sum, or their home was on the line. Axos initiated foreclosure proceedings a few months later.\n\nAt that point, a little more than two years after they started this journey, Mr. Urban said they had paid back about $240,000 on the $218,000 loan — though, when the loan had closed, he said they had received only about $185,000 after fees and closing costs.\n\nThe legal arguments contesting rent-a-bank arrangements have often centered around which entity serves as the true lender, or who had the “predominant economic interest” in the transaction. In most cases it’s the nonbank lender, advocates and legal experts said, since that’s the entity typically handling the entire transaction — both making and later carrying the loan and collecting payments.\n\nBut it can be challenging for borrowers who wish to go to court to prove which entity is the true lender. Adam Levitin, a professor at Georgetown Law who has published a paper on rent-a-bank partnerships, said that many of the facts needed to establish who the true lender is are often not publicly available.\n\nIn the past, Axos — with offices in Nevada, which generally has fewer rate restrictions — has sold these loans to World Business Lenders, experts said.\n\nIn the Urbans’ situation, Axos is the named lender on the loan documents and claims to have retained the loan, according to legal filings. But as Professor Levitin points out, it’s possible World Business Lenders purchased a “participation” in the loan — a derivative interest equal to a large percentage of the note.\n\n“The loan itself stays on Axos’s balance sheet, so Axos is the party that ‘owns’ the loan, but almost all of the economic interest is transferred to WBL,” he said. “That’s how a lot of other rent-a-bank arrangements work these days. It’s all a beard.”\n\nWorld Business Lenders did not respond to requests for comment. Axos declined to comment.\n\nEven though the Urbans' borrowing was backed by their family home, they received a business loan, which comes with far fewer consumer protections than personal credit. Indeed, under New York law, companies can’t claim civil usury — only criminal usury, which is more challenging to prove.\n\nThe Urbans have argued that Axos’s loan, among other things, was “criminally usurious,” making the loan void, and asked the courts to dismiss the foreclosure. But Axos prevailed in court.  The couple had filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop all collection activity and is trying to retain a new lawyer.\n\nThe broader regulatory landscape remains complicated. At the end of the first Trump administration, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency issued a “true lender” rule, which said that the bank is the lender in a partnership with a non-bank if it’s named in the loan documents or funds the loan (even if it sold the loan back to the partner). Consumer advocates said the rule cleared the way for these and other high-interest schemes to proliferate — and undermines states’ abilities to protect their residents.\n\nIt didn’t last long. Congress, urged by consumer advocates, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general and others, overturned the rule, and their resolution was signed into law by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nMost recently, a federal appellate court in Denver ruled that Colorado could opt out of a federal law that allows state-chartered banks located elsewhere to export high interest rates into the state. This decision could pave the way for other states to do the same, though the ruling could be challenged, advocates said.\n\n“A banking charter is a privilege,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, “not a ticket to receive a share of profits from regulatory arbitrage.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Susan Beachy contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/business/homeowners-moving-mortgage-rates.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"14:24:04-05:00","title":"They Rushed to Buy Homes During the Pandemic.

Both had new jobs — Ms. Lachhman as a hospital operations manager and Mr. Parmassar in cybersecurity — and were eager to lock in a deal while they still could.\n\nAfter spending almost every weekend for three months looking at houses, the couple secured a two-bedroom, two-bathroom home with a pool, paying around $660,000, about $30,000 over asking price, at a 4 percent interest rate.\n\n“The way the housing market was during the pandemic, it gave millennials such as myself a very good opportunity to get into the housing market,” said Ms. Lachhman. “It would have been a much more difficult process now.”\n\nThe couple is still in the house and doing well on paper. Their monthly payment of about $5,000 hasn’t budged, leaving room for savings and entertainment. But life looks different. Now, the couple has a Labrador retriever, an 18-month-old and another baby on the way, and the house feels a lot smaller than it used to.\n\nIt’s a dilemma they share with many other Americans who purchased houses during the pandemic: financially grounded, yet physically stuck and unsure how to move forward.\n\nWhen the world shut down and mortgage rates tumbled, buying a home felt like the ultimate act of security. Americans rushed to buy, some pooling resources with siblings, partners or friends to make it possible. During the pandemic, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell below 3 percent for the first time, and hit a record low of 2.65 percent in early 2021, according to Freddie Mac. For many, that moment felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nThose who secured a rate below 3 percent found themselves “a rarity and something we might not see again for a very long time,” said Stephanie Williams, a senior wealth adviser at investment firm AlphaCore Wealth Advisory. And according to a 2023 Realtor.com and HarrisX survey, about 82 percent of homeowners said they felt “locked in” by their low mortgage rate, and more than half were waiting for conditions to improve before selling.\n\nA few years later, some of those pandemic buyers are caught between stability and a desire for change.\n\n“Many people bought their homes in the hopes it was an initial steppingstone on the path to a more ideal property; yet with higher interest rates and more limited inventory, that ‘starter home’ has become a long-term one,” said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Intuit Credit Karma. “It can leave people feeling trapped.”\n\nNearly one in four homeowners regret their purchase, according to a recent survey by Intuit Credit Karma, including 38 percent of millennials, who said they underestimated the costs of ownership, and another 40 percent who have postponed other life goals. Add in rising costs and life changes — new partners, children, breakups — and that stability can start to feel more like confinement.\n\nIn today’s high-rate, high-price market, many homeowners can’t justify trading their 3 percent mortgage for one that’s twice as expensive, said Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com. Yet, many homeowners who want a change aren’t sure whether to rent out their home, sell it or stay put. With President Trump’s recent proposal of a 50-year-mortgage as a way to make home buying more affordable, some feel pressure to keep their low-interest, 30-year mortgages.\n\nFor Amber McDorman and her husband, buying a home in the suburbs of Phoenix during the pandemic was a mix of luck and timing. They had started looking the year before, but listings came and went in the blink of an eye: One week they were outbid; the next, prices jumped beyond their budget.\n\nThen mortgage rates began dipping below 3 percent, and things started looking up. With a 2.5 percent interest rate, the McDormans secured a three-bedroom home for around $260,000 in 2020. Five years later, they’re still paying $1,300 a month, and their equity has soared by 65 percent.\n\nBack then, the home felt perfect for two people with one child. But they have added a second child to their family, and both work primarily from home, often sharing the same office. The couple would love more space but can’t bring themselves to trade their mortgage for today’s higher rates and home prices. Adding an extension for another bedroom or office could cost up to $50,000, Ms. McDorman said.\n\n“I honestly feel like we’re kind of the lucky ones,” said Ms. McDorman, a social worker in her late 30s. “But we didn’t intend for this to be our forever home.”\n\nLissette Debord and her husband decided to sell the starter home they purchased during the pandemic instead of staying in a place they’d outgrown. They bought the house in 2020 in Sussex County, N.J., when they were both 21, during Ms. Debord’s last semester of college, using money they saved by having a virtual wedding on Zoom to secure a 2.7 percent interest rate. The couple was able to afford the $250,000 two-bedroom home through a combination of personal savings, bank loans and first-time home buyer benefits.\n\nThe pandemic made them rethink their priorities.\n\n“Like, ‘Are we going to invest in one day, or are we going to invest in something that’s going to build our future?’” said Ms. Debord, who is now 26 and works as an analyst at an executive recruiting firm.\n\nLast year, with their first child, they moved into a larger home in Jefferson, N.J., gaining an extra bedroom and more space. The trade-off was steep: Their new mortgage is now more than double the old one, and has a 6.6 percent interest rate.\n\nNow, with another baby on the way, the higher payments have reshaped their lives. Ms. Debord and her family have had to cut back on outings and vacations, and must budget more carefully while managing child care and other household costs.\n\n“We took a chance,” Ms. Debord said. “It is what it is now.”\n\nJa’nise Johnson, 41, bought a four-bedroom home in Tampa, Fla., in 2019, securing an interest rate of around 3 percent. She had a job in insurance for seven years, but when the pandemic hit in 2020, she was furloughed, making it hard for her to keep up mortgage payments while raising three boys as a single mother.\n\nWithin the first year, she defaulted on her mortgage. She leaned heavily on friends and family and took side gigs like DoorDash to make ends meet. But she didn’t want to give up the home, wanting to maintain stability for her three children.\n\nLast year, because she was behind on payments, she had to refinance her mortgage for a higher rate of 5.3 percent. That increased her monthly payments to $2,800 from $1,700, limiting her financial flexibility and ability to move.\n\nYet Ms. Johnson’s biggest regret isn’t buying the home or staying in it when she couldn’t afford the costs: It is not buying a home sooner.\n\n“I probably would have owned my home by this time,” said Ms. Johnson, who now works as a project manager for a financial services company. “Now, I don’t know how long it’s going to take.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/trump-pope-leo-maga-christianity.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"06:00:22-05:00","title":"Pope Leo Doesn’t Want to Be the Anti-Trump.

Pope Leo Doesn’t Want to Be the Anti-Trump. But He Is.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T06:00:22-05:00\n\nLast week, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a “special message” on immigration that was an unmistakable rebuke of the Trump administration and its cruel and punitive immigration crackdown. The message did not mention President Trump by name, but its meaning could not have been clearer.\n\nBy a vote of 216 to 5, with three abstentions, the bishops approved a statement that said, in part: “We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement. We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants.”\n\nThe bishops also opposed “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and prayed for “an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.”\n\nA number of bishops also read the statement out loud in a powerful video message posted on YouTube.\n\nThe bishops were following the lead of Pope Leo XIV, who has raised a number of specific objections to the Trump administration’s treatment of migrants. In September, the pope told journalists, “Someone who says I am against abortion but I am in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”\n\nOn Nov. 4, journalists asked the pope specifically about the treatment of detainees at the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill. Federal officials had denied entry to the facility to a delegation that included a Catholic bishop who hoped to offer communion to the inmates inside.\n\nThe pope responded with an appeal to Scripture: “Jesus says very clearly at the end of the world, we’re going to be asked, you know, how did you receive the foreigner? Did you receive him and welcome him or not? And I think that there’s a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what’s happening.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time that the Republican immigration crackdown has clashed with Catholic religious liberty. In January, I highlighted a disturbing case in Texas, where the attorney general, Ken Paxton, was directly attacking the religious freedom rights of the Annunciation House, a religious nonprofit founded by Catholics in El Paso. Paxton made the remarkable argument that blocking Annunciation House from providing food, shelter and clothing to migrants would not substantially burden its free exercise of religion.\n\nServing the most marginalized is fundamental to the Christian faith. By one count, more than 2,000 scriptural passages mandate or endorse service to the poor and the work of justice.\n\nIn May, just after the pope’s election, I wrote that the most important American in the world was no longer named Donald Trump. The president has less than four years left at the center of the international stage. The pope will present a global moral witness for years to come, and it’s a moral witness that is fundamentally incompatible with the cruelty and corruption of Trumpism.\n\nIf you examine the new pope’s pronouncements, there is a consistent through line. He defends human dignity and condemns government brutality. In addition to his defense of the human rights of migrants, he’s decried Russian abuses in Ukraine, and he’s called for a cease-fire, hostage release and compliance with international humanitarian law in Gaza.\n\nHis concern for human dignity extends to the world of technology and commerce as well. On Nov. 7, for example, he posted on social media: “Technological innovation can be a form of participation in the divine act of creation. It carries an ethical and spiritual weight, for every design choice expresses a vision of humanity. The Church therefore calls all builders of #AI to cultivate moral discernment as a fundamental part of their work—to develop systems that reflect justice, solidarity, and a genuine reverence for life.”\n\nThe pope’s comment drew an immediate rebuke from Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Trump supporter, who posted (and then deleted) a meme mocking the pope’s statement.\n\nEach of the pope’s statements are part of a consistent ethic of life. I love the Catholic writer Mark Shea’s description of what this ethic means — that “all human beings, without any exception whatsoever, are made in the image and likeness of God and that Jesus Christ died for all human beings, without any exception whatsoever. Therefore each human person — without any exception whatsoever — is sacred and is the only creature that God wills for its own sake.”\n\nIn this formulation, the fundamental moral basis of the pro-life movement is the idea that every single human being is created in the image of God and thus should be treated with dignity and respect at every stage of life, a concept that includes abortion but extends far beyond it as well.\n\nIn this context, it is a mistake to view abortion as somehow distinct from the dehumanization and abuse of migrants. The holistic pro-life view doesn’t just ask, “Is a baby being harmed?” It asks, “Are people being harmed?”\n\nAnd make no mistake, people are being harmed. To take just one dreadful example, on Wednesday, The Guardian reported that two human rights groups had found that “more than 252 Venezuelans expelled to El Salvador under Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy suffered systematic and prolonged torture and abuse, including sexual assault,” during their detention at a notorious El Salvadoran prison named CECOT.\n\nWhen I said that the path past Trumpism is beginning to emerge, I did not and do not mean that the pope will somehow enable the defeat of any particular politician or program at the ballot box. American Catholics are true swing voters. A majority voted for Trump in 2024, but a majority disapprove of him now. And there are many devout Catholics who are deeply embedded in the MAGA movement, including Vice President JD Vance.\n\nPartisanship is poisonous to the church. Neither party’s political platform truly embodies the teachings of the New Testament. Each party has its moral strengths and weaknesses, which is why you can find Christians and people of every faith and no faith on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nBut when partisanship becomes part of your identity — much less part of your faith — it has a pernicious effect: It causes you to highlight the deficiencies of the other side while tempting you to rationalize or minimize the injustices on your own. Partisanship makes hypocrites of us all. I know it made a hypocrite of me on my worst partisan days.\n\nThe approach that Pope Leo takes, by contrast, puts virtue outside and above politics. His declarations are the living embodiment of Martin Luther King Jr.’s admonition that the church “is not to be the master or the servant of the state, but the conscience of the state.”\n\nI’m not Catholic, but I can see that the Catholic Church enjoys some profound advantages over the American evangelical church in taking King’s approach. The Catholic Church is a global church that existed for more than a thousand years before the founding of America. American evangelicals, by contrast, often belong to churches and denominations that were founded in America, remain rooted in America, and they have a distinct, America-centered political worldview.\n\nSadly, this means that American evangelical influence is often rooted more in its partisan affiliations than in its moral witness. When Republicans dominate the government, evangelicals tend to feel more confident and secure. When Democrats win the White House, then evangelicals tend to feel more defensive and fearful, as if their churches are at the edge of extinction.\n\nThe result is a relentless one-way cultural ratchet that amplifies Democratic sins and minimizes Republican vices. It elevates politics to the place of religion because it is only through politics that many evangelicals can feel confident and secure in the practice of their faith.\n\nThis is why Trumpism is a thoroughly religious movement. Trump owes his political power to white evangelicals more than to any other group. In fact, according to exit polls, if you removed white evangelical votes from the 2024 presidential election, Trump would have lost in a 58-to-40 percent landslide, which would have been more than enough to turn the Electoral College in Kamala Harris’s favor.\n\nSince Trumpism is a religious phenomenon, it requires a religious answer. But it can’t be a partisan answer. That’s why it was wise for the bishops not to directly mention Trump in their statement. The goal isn’t to attack one man or one movement, but to uphold a particular set of values and to measure every politician — including politicians of your own party — by his or her dedication to the notion, as Mark Shea wrote, that “each human person — without any exception whatsoever — is sacred.”\n\nIf you’re a Republican in part because you believe that Democrats disregard the value of unborn life, that doesn’t mean that you abandon migrants to degrading and inhumane treatment because you don’t want to risk stoking outrage against the Republican Party and its leaders.\n\nConversely, it’s a profound mistake to swallow your tongue when Democrats advance permissive abortion rules because you’re worried that calling out, say, Chuck Schumer or Hakeem Jeffries will help Donald Trump.\n\nI’m under no illusions that Pope Leo’s example will matter to the evangelical political class. It is so far gone that many of its leading lights advance the absurd claim that Christians cannot vote for Democrats.\n\nBut a pope’s moral witness can — and should — still matter to Christians of every tradition. The American evangelical church is one tributary to the broad stream of American (much less global) Christianity. There is an enormous amount of theological cross-pollination in the United States.\n\nI know this because I’ve experienced it. Pope John Paul II’s seminal encyclical on the value of human life, Evangelium Vitae, has influenced me more than any Protestant book about the dignity of all human life. I grew up in an evangelical intellectual culture that saw Pope John Paul II’s opposition to the brutality of communism as an indispensable element in the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of liberal democracy in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn the words of Barbara Elliott, a fellow of the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, the pope achieved a “spiritual victory” over Soviet communism. He was the “spiritual leader of this peaceful revolution that shattered communism.”\n\nUnless the values behind Trumpism are defeated, the man himself will be replaced by another like him — Republican or Democrat — and our culture will continue to slide into cruelty and depravity.\n\nTo quote Pope Leo, “justice, solidarity, and a genuine reverence for life” ought to be the touchstones of our public engagement. There is another spiritual victory to be won — this time over the forces of hatred, division and cruelty in these United States.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Camp Mystic.\n\nBy J. David Goodman, Malika Khurana, Bora Erden, Marco Hernandez, Yuhan Liu, Karthik Patanjali, Bedel Saget and Charlie Smart\n\nSource: Flooding data from First Street. 3-D model of camp based on LiDAR data captured by The Times on Nov. 12.\n\nAcross Camp Mystic on the night of July 3, 195 campers settled into their bunks. Taps played over a loudspeaker shortly after 10 p.m. Dick Eastland, the 70-year-old patriarch of the family-run all girls camp, was at home in his creek-side house on the camp property, not far from the cabins.\n\nSo too was Edward Eastland, one of his sons. Edward grew up at Camp Mystic and now directs the camp along with his wife Mary Liz, living in a house even closer to the cabins and the Guadalupe River than his father.\n\nHeavy rain was in the forecast, and camp staffers had already pulled from the water the largest boats — 20-foot-long “war canoes” — as they always did before a big rain in the flood-prone area.\n\nWhat follows is the most detailed description to date of the events that took the lives of more than two dozen campers and counselors, and the elder Mr. Eastland, at the 99-year-old summer retreat.\n\nThe descriptions and rendering of those events were taken from the first interviews that Camp Mystic’s owners have granted, along with never-before-seen videos and photos taken during flooding at the camp, data from devices such as Apple watches, cell phones and vehicle crash data, and court documents from a lawsuit filed by some of the parents of children who died.\n\nThe Times visualized the water levels at the camp over the course of the night using videos and photos from the camp and estimates from a flood simulation by First Street, a nonprofit that assesses flood risk in the United States. The moving dots on the diagrams in this story show the simulated flow and depth of water at different times, and the extent of flooding.\n\nAt 1:14 a.m. on July 4, the National Weather Service warned of potentially life-threatening flooding in the area. By that point, according to data from his phone, Dick Eastland was already up and monitoring the weather.\n\nAround 1:45 a.m., he radioed his son, Edward. “His words were that we’ve gotten about two inches of rain in the last hour and that we need to move the waterfront equipment,” Edward Eastland told The New York Times, his first time recounting his story publicly. Members of the grounds crew went to the waterfront and pulled the remaining smaller canoes to higher ground on the hill nearer to the cabins. No one expected the water to rise that high, Edward Eastland said.\n\nHe drove to the camp office where his father and the night watchman, Glenn Juenke, were monitoring the weather. The elder Mr. Eastland checked the rain gauge that he kept at his house. A group of workers had just returned to the camp from a day off, describing a harrowing drive in the pouring rain.\n\nStanding outside the office, Mr. Juenke filmed a creek, usually dry, that was strongly flowing nearby.\n\n“Bubble Gum Creek is bad,” Edward Eastland texted his wife, at 2:21 a.m. “Look at the radar.” A severe thunderstorm hovered over the camp, he recalled in the interview. “Looks short tho,” she texted back, believing the heaviest rain would soon pass. “It kept saying that it would end in 30 minutes,” he recalled.\n\nAround that time, two counselors from Bug House — a cabin of 12-year-olds closest to the river — came to the office to report water running down a steep hill into their cabin door. Edward and his father drove them back, and tried to reassure them. “At that point,” he recalled, “it was a normal flood.”\n\nA little before 3 a.m., Edward said, a call came over the radio from a staff member in the gatehouse at the camp entrance, right along the river. “She said there’s water coming in her cabin,” he said. “She couldn't get the door open.” Then her radio made some “very strange noises.” He could not reach her again. (The gatehouse cabin was eventually swept away in the flood; the woman survived by clinging to a tree.)\n\nAt about that time, Mr. Eastland said his father radioed from Bug House where the river was rising. “My dad said, we need to get Bug House out,” he recalled.\n\nThe evacuation began, he said. Mr. Eastland, his father and Mr. Juenke loaded campers into each of their vehicles — two pickups and an S.U.V. — in two trips, bringing campers to the main office and directing them to walk the short distance to the recreation hall.\n\nCounselors in a cabin further up the road, Nut Hut, watched as the evacuation took place.\n\nThe camp’s one-page safety plan, reviewed by The Times, called for them to shelter in place in a flood.\n\nDuring the evacuation on July 4, the counselors were told “by the camp” not to leave their cabins, according to a lawsuit filed against Mystic. But as the water rose, the Nut Hut counselors evacuated themselves and their campers, climbing a steep hill behind their cabin.\n\nEdward Eastland denied directing anyone to stay put during the evacuation. “When Jumble House asked me if they should walk, I said, ‘yes, go,’” he recalled, referring to another cabin.\n\nIn all, counselors in two cabins eventually evacuated on their own, climbing up the hill with their campers. Mr. Juenke helped those in a third cabin reach the hill, and then sent them up.\n\nThe water kept rising. A counselor photographed the girls walking to the recreation hall at 3:26 a.m.\n\n“On the second trip, the water was running over the road. It was probably ankle deep,” Edward Eastland said. By then, water covered the sloping grass between the cabins and the river. Lightning crashed, revealing canoes floating over the soccer field.\n\nSoon it was up to the top of his truck tires, he said.\n\nAt that point, Mr. Eastland and his father turned to the cabins of the youngest campers, Bubble Inn and Twins. A video, taken at 3:26 a.m. by one of the workers from a second-floor sleeping area above the commissary, captured deepening water swiftly moving past Twins, while, in the distance, campers were still able to wade through ankle and knee-deep water into the rec hall.\n\nVideos showing the Recreation hall and the Twins cabin.\n\nMr. Juenke ended up in a cabin called Wiggle Inn, where he would ride out the rising water, with the campers and two counselors floating on inflatable mattresses. “We’re going to be OK,” Mr. Juenke recalled telling them.\n\nDick Eastland parked his S.U.V. by the entrance to Bubble Inn. “He was standing outside of his Tahoe, and the water was rushing all around these cabins at this point, it was probably two or three feet,” his son said. “That’s the last place I saw him.”\n\nEdward Eastland walked around Giggle Box and through waist-high water to the pair of connected cabins known as Twins.\n\n“It feels like rapids at that point,” he said. He saw two counselors calling out for help from the porch. As he got to the cabin, he said he thought to himself, “we cannot get these eight-year-olds out of this cabin in this water.”\n\nVideos appear to show that the water rose about five feet in 24 minutes.\n\nWater, he said, had never reached the cabin, not in 100 years. “It was unbelievable,” Edward Eastland recalled.\n\nInside the first Twins cabin, a dozen 8-year-old girls huddled in the corner together on top of two bunk beds.\n\n“I tell them, I'm here and I'm not leaving you guys, and everything's gonna be OK,” he said. The 11 girls in the second Twins cabin were also on the top bunks. The water at that point was rushing by the doorways and filling both cabins.\n\n“Water started coming in through the window,” he said. “I yelled to the counselors, does anybody have a screwdriver?” Edward Eastland was thinking of trying to remove a metal vent in the low ceiling to climb through. As he moved between cabins, the counselors were yelling that the water was chest high.\n\n“I remember seeing the waterline and just praying that it would stop going up,” he said. “And it just kept going up.”\n\nMr. Eastland said he was able to talk to his father on the radio, and he heard him struggling in the water.\n\n“He said, ‘I need help. I can't move,’” Mr. Eastland recalled. “I said, I can’t.”\n\nDick Eastland appeared to have been trying to get the eight-year-old girls out of Bubble Inn and into his Tahoe. It was not clear if he loaded all 13 campers and two counselors inside.\n\n“He was right there,” Mr. Eastland recalled, standing outside the Twins cabins on a recent sunny morning, with Bubble Inn just a few steps away. But from inside the cabin that night, Mr. Eastland said he could not see him.\n\nThen his father’s radio seemed to malfunction, Mr. Eastland said.\n\nThe water picked up Dick Eastland’s S.U.V., carrying it forcefully over the soccer field, down past the archery range and into a grove by the river, smashing the vehicle against a tall Cypress.\n\nA data report from his vehicle, reviewed by The Times, indicated a crash at 3:51 a.m. His Apple watch showed he went underwater at the same time. He was found dead in the S.U.V., along with three campers from Bubble Inn.\n\nAround that time, Mr. Eastland said he was in the second Twins cabin, the water at his shoulders, when a counselor yelled from the other Twins cabin that the water was carrying girls out the door.\n\n“I'm right here in the doorway, and three girls come out of that door,” Mr. Eastland recalled, his voice shaking. “I catch two of them, and one girl gets away into the darkness.”\n\nAs he held the two girls, and gripped the doorway, the water began to rise over his head. Another camper swept from the cabin behind him grabbed onto him.\n\n“I have no idea who it was,” he said. “She put her arms around my neck” and tried to hold on.\n\nThen, he said, the water pushed him and the girls holding onto him from the cabin into the surging river.\n\nData from his Apple watch, reviewed by The Times, indicated that Mr. Eastland went underwater at 4:09 a.m.\n\nHe struggled against the current. “I could feel the pressure, like I was almost to the top,” he said, but the surface, “it just, it wasn't there.”\n\nThe flow of the water carried Mr. Eastland alone past a row of trees along the road where an hour before he had been evacuating campers. Now the water reached the branches, which he tried to seize. But, he said, they kept breaking.\n\nEventually the water pushed him into the canopy of a pair of large trees, just below the Bug House cabin. He grabbed on.\n\nSeveral campers and counselors from the Twins cabins were already there, clinging for their lives, Mr. Eastland said. Eight campers and three counselors survived by holding on to the same trees, he said. Another counselor survived in a tree along the road, and another camper also was found alive nearby, he said. Three more campers were later found alive down river.\n\nThe scale of the loss became clear only after the water receded, Mr. Eastland said.\n\nEleven campers from the two Twins cabins died in the flood. All 13 campers and both counselors who were in Bubble Inn died. Another girl was swept away after trying to return to her cabin, Jumble House, for a blanket after evacuating.\n\nThe body of one girl from Twins, Cile Steward, 8, has still not been found.\n\nThe waterlines in the cabins, measured by The Times, rose well above the heads of the campers.\n\nThe concrete-block base of one wall was pushed in by the floodwater.\n\nIn one of the Twins cabins, the lines appeared to reach the low, flat ceiling. In the other, the water stopped a few inches from the ceiling.\n\nResidue on the wall shows that the water rose to just six inches below the ceiling.\n\nNone of the buildings at the camp, except for the gatehouse and a wing of the commissary used for storage, were destroyed, though many were damaged. In Bubble Inn, the waterline was 6 feet 3 inches from the floor.\n\nThe riverwaters eventually surrounded and filled the first floor of the open, two-story recreation hall, where 95 campers and 15 counselors had gathered for safety, according to figures provided by Camp Mystic. They huddled on the narrow second-floor balcony that wrapped around the log-frame structure, watching beneath them the water flow through the building.\n\nThe relatives of some of the 25 campers and two counselors who died have filed lawsuits against the camp and the Eastland family, arguing that the camp had been negligent in advance of the flood and that the last-minute rescue efforts were undertaken too late.\n\n“The Camp chose not to evacuate its campers and counselors, even as floodwater reached the cabins, until counselors demanded it,” according to one of the suits. “When it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster.”\n\nIn interviews with The Times, Mr. Eastland and his brother Richard, who also works and lives at the camp, said that based on decades of experience living at the camp and running it through previous floods, they believed the cabins were the safest place for the campers.\n\n“In our minds, the cabins were built on high ground,” Richard Eastland said.\n\nThe family felt that way even after a 2011 FEMA map placed most of the cabins, including Bubble Inn and Twins, within a 100-year flood zone. The camp hired surveyors who argued there were errors in the topography used for that map; the federal agency in 2013 removed the cabins from the floodplain maps.\n\nBut the July 4 flood had changed what high ground was for the camp, Richard Eastland said.\n\nThere had been no plan for how to evacuate campers, the Eastlands said. The evacuation was improvised, as the water level rose more rapidly than they had ever seen. The camp is planning to create an evacuation plan for the future, Richard Eastland said.\n\nAnd, the Eastlands said, the camp will never again use the cabins that flooded to house campers or counselors.\n\nBut next summer they plan to reopen their separate, adjacent camp – Camp Mystic Cypress Lake – that sits higher up a hill and did not flood that holiday weekend.\n\nSome families have welcomed the news, while others, including those whose children died in the flood and the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, have criticized the camp for its decision. The Texas Legislature is planning to hold hearings on what took place at the camp though a date has not yet been announced.\n\nEdward Eastland said he has been going to counseling. He has returned many times to the spot where his father died along with several girls from Bubble Inn, at the base of a Cypress tree, by the now-gently flowing river.\n\n“Every morning is horrible,” he said, his voice quavering. “I want to help the families. I don't know what to do though.”\n\n“We are so sorry,” said his wife, Mary Liz. “I feel like no one thinks that we're sorry.”\n\nTimes’ journalists generated the 3-D model of Camp Mystic from high-resolution LiDAR data captured by The Times using a drone flown over the camp on Nov. 12. The flood simulation provided by First Street models water levels at the camp over the course of the night, based on rain on the night of the flood and topography in the area. Photos and videos from the camp point to water levels even higher than the simulation’s estimate.\n\nRuth Graham and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

a Lost New York\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T05:01:46-05:00\n\nWashington went nuts — and the White House went on the defensive — after lawmakers dumped more than 20,000 emails belonging to Jeffrey Epstein into the public domain on Wednesday. The central intrigue was the late financier’s relationship with the president, but there were other stories buried in the mass of documents.\n\nThe emails are like a portal back to a lost Manhattan power scene. Mr. Epstein’s inbox was larded with boldface names — many of them now faded or forgotten — that once meant everything to status-obsessed New Yorkers. It was the world that Donald Trump came out of, and the one that Mr. Epstein had so effectively beguiled after having grown up in a middle-class household in Coney Island.\n\nAs the emails stretch through the years, they show how that protected realm vanished into the mists of time, pulled under by the rising forces of the internet and the #MeToo movement. Mr. Epstein and some of his male correspondents seem to squirm as they notice society changing around them.\n\nThe bulk of the documents come from an email address ([email protected]) that was set up around 2009, when Mr. Epstein was released from the Palm Beach County jail after having served 13 months of an 18-month sentence on a reduced charge of soliciting prostitution. It wasn’t exactly hard time: Florida officials allowed him to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week, outside the facility.\n\nThe newly available emails continue into the summer of 2019, when Mr. Epstein was arrested and imprisoned after federal prosecutors charged him with sex trafficking. (He was found dead in his cell at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan on Aug. 10, 2019.)\n\nThe earliest documents in the collection depict the twilight of an old guard made up of Wall Street billionaires, media-industry heavyweights, politicians and old-money socialites, many of whom gathered at Mr. Epstein’s seven-story townhouse on the Upper East Side — a mansion that one guest, Woody Allen, compared to Dracula’s castle.\n\nIn those days, print newspapers and magazines still held sway, and Mr. Epstein had close ties to many key players in the news media and adjacent industries. He exchanged emails with a number of insiders, including the real estate magnate Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who was then the owner of The New York Daily News. Along with the journalist Michael Wolff, Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Epstein had been part of a group that made an unsuccessful bid for New York Magazine in 2003. Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Epstein were at it again the next year, when they tried to buy Radar magazine.\n\nThe cache of emails includes exchanges about going to dinner at Rao’s, the uptown Italian restaurant where it was famously hard to get a table, and an invitation for Mr. Epstein to the 25th anniversary party for The New York Observer (it was a weekly paper, printed on salmon-colored newsprint and read by the city’s elite) at the Four Seasons restaurant (where the elite once power-lunched; it’s now closed) co-hosted by Michael Bloomberg (he was the mayor) and Jared Kushner (who owned The Observer). The guest list included Matt Lauer and Harvey Weinstein. You’ve probably heard about what happened with them.\n\n“The celebration is going to be one of those quintessential New York nights,” read the party invitation, which was sent by the publicist Peggy Siegal, who was one of the city’s social gatekeepers until her reputation was tarnished by her association with Mr. Epstein.\n\nMs. Siegal is all over his inbox, and her emails carry with them the atmosphere of a New York that no longer exists. She would send Mr. Epstein articles she had written for Avenue Magazine (a society publication one would encounter in the lobbies of doorman buildings on the Upper East Side) and dispatches from her nights out at The Monkey Bar, back when that restaurant was co-owned by Graydon Carter, then the editor of Vanity Fair.\n\nThe emails show how the clubby nature of the old media suited Mr. Epstein. R. Couri Hay, a well-connected press agent, was another of Mr. Epstein’s correspondents. In 2011, Mr. Hay sent an email to warn that Tina Brown (the former editor of The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, who was in charge of Newsweek and The Daily Beast at the time) had assigned a story on Mr. Epstein to the writer Alexandra Wolfe (whose father was Tom Wolfe).\n\n“This is for Newsweek, the magazine that is on the stands, not the website,” Mr. Hay explained.\n\nHe offered to help. He told Mr. Epstein that the planned article was to be about his “reemergence in New York” after “your previous problems.” He suggested providing “names and numbers of pro Jeffery power brokers for Alexandra to call.” Mr. Hay went on to note that the reporter had already checked in with a few people in Mr. Epstein’s orbit: the private equity titan Leon Black, the Victoria’s Secret billionaire Leslie Wexner and Mr. Trump.\n\nReached by phone on Friday, Mr. Hay insisted that he had never ended up doing any publicity work for Mr. Epstein. He added that he had only contacted the financier at the behest of a mutual friend, Jonathan Farkas, a department-store heir who is included in the email dump.\n\nBy the time Mr. Hay reached out, Mr. Epstein was a registered sex offender. He also faced a number of lawsuits and was under investigation by the F.B.I.\n\nMr. Hay said that, like others who moved among Manhattan’s elite in those days, he was not fully aware of how “heinous” Mr. Epstein was, adding that he felt bamboozled by his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n“I admit that I, too, along the way, had been blinded a little bit by the glamorous facade that Jeffrey and Ghislaine put on in social circles in New York and in Palm Beach,” he said.\n\nIn his attempts to improve his public image in 2011, Mr. Epstein also emailed with Ms. Siegal, trying to get her to lean on Arianna Huffington to publish some pro-Jeffrey content in The Huffington Post. “If you rewrite your last email in better grammar,” Ms. Siegal wrote, “I can cut and paste and send it to Arianna Huffington from me.”\n\nMs. Siegal said Friday that she never did forward that email to Ms. Huffington. So then why did she tell Mr. Epstein she would? “People say things just to get people off the phone,” Ms. Siegal said.\n\n“I was never contacted,” said Ms. Huffington, who co-founded The Huffington Post (now HuffPost) in 2005 and stayed on through 2016.\n\nMr. Epstein was also in contact with Landon Thomas Jr., a reporter at The New York Times from 2002 to 2019. Mr. Thomas, who wrote a feature story on Mr. Epstein for New York Magazine in 2002, left The Times after “his failure to abide by our ethical standards,” according to a Times spokeswoman. The lapse came when Mr. Thomas was found to have solicited a donation from Mr. Epstein for a cultural center in Harlem.\n\nAs print began to fade, Mr. Epstein hired a digital consultant to try to squelch negative articles about himself from search results, but it didn’t seem to work. Mr. Epstein sent a series of screenshots to the consultant in 2014 showing that, when he searched his name from a new computer in the Virgin Islands, the results remained the same.\n\nMr. Wolff popped into Mr. Epstein’s inbox often to brainstorm about how to shape his media coverage, suggesting publications that might accept an opinion piece, or a reporter who could prove sympathetic.\n\nMr. Wolff also offered up his own column inches to help his friend. He had joined USA Today as a freelance columnist; and he mentioned in 2015 that he could use New York Magazine. In 2016, Mr. Wolff advised Mr. Epstein to try to do some reputational repair work with an appearance on Charlie Rose’s PBS talk show.\n\nMr. Rose would lose that show, not to mention his anchor job at CBS, in 2017, when multiple allegations of sexual harassment were made against him at the height of the #MeToo movement. From the vantage point of Mr. Epstein’s inbox, the revelations concerning the abusive behavior of men in power played out like a psychological thriller.\n\nMr. Epstein wrote to one confidant: “so many guys caught in the me too reaching out to me asking when does the madness stop.” To another, he wrote: “brett ratner now. Oy.”\n\nMr. Epstein was referring to the film director and producer, who had stepped away from a $450 million deal with Warner Bros. after The Los Angeles Times reported on allegations made against him by six women. Mr. Ratner has since resurfaced as the director of “Melania,” a soon-to-be-released Amazon Prime documentary about Melania Trump, which the first lady is producing.\n\nMr. Epstein and Mr. Wolff also emailed about another director whose reputation had sagged, their mutual friend Mr. Allen. Mr. Epstein fretted to Mr. Wolff that Mr. Allen’s “brain trust” wasn’t savvy enough to help him fight back in the digital era. “They are all old thinkers,” Mr. Epstein wrote, adding: “no social media strategy.”\n\nIn 2018, someone forwarded to Mr. Epstein that year’s program for Ms. Brown’s Women in the World Summit, which boasted a “power packed agenda of remarkable female newsmakers sharing their stories of male misbehavior.”\n\n“Let’s do a men of the world conference,” wrote Lawrence Krauss, a prominent theoretical physicist at Arizona State University, who would soon depart the university after being accused by several women of sexual misconduct. His proposed summit, he wrote, would include Kevin Spacey, Bill Clinton, Al Franken and Mr. Allen.\n\nToward the end of his life, Mr. Epstein expressed amazement about the sudden cultural shift in an email to Joi Ito, who ran the media lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology until he resigned in 2019 over his connection to the befouled financier. In addition to losing his M.I.T. post, Mr. Ito stepped down from board positions at the MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and The New York Times Company.\n\n“With all these guys getting busted for harassment, i have moved slightly up the reputation ladder and have been asked everyday for advice etc,” Mr. Epstein wrote to Mr. Ito.\n\nSo many of the people whose names appear in the recently released emails have now left the public stage. But not the man occupying the Oval Office.\n\n“Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat’s problem,” Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday.\n\nHe then set his sights on the former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and the venture capitalist and Democratic political donor Reid Hoffman: “Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Summers about Epstein, they know all about him, don’t waste your time with Trump. I have a country to run!”\n\n"}]}
