Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California last week  gathered enough signatures  on a discharge petition to force such a vote.\n \n\n   \n  Massie and Khanna appeared optimistic earlier Sunday about their bill’s chances of passing, insisting there was growing support among the GOP in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Massie said he thought 100 or more Republicans in the House could break with Trump, who last week  appealed  to a handful of Republicans who signed on to the Kentucky lawmaker’s discharge petition effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we could have a deluge of Republicans. There could be 100 or more. I’m hoping to get a veto-proof majority on this legislation when it comes up for a vote,” Massie said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  reported  last week that GOP leaders were bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from Trump and support the bill.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation, which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate. On Sunday, Johnson appeared to preview Trump’s message to House Republicans, telling “Fox News Sunday,” “We’ll just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote, which is expected on Tuesday, came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the oversight panel last week.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said late last week that he would  ask the Justice Department  to investigate Epstein’s ties to a slew of high-profile figures linked to the Democratic Party, representing the president’s most significant effort to discredit the push to release all of the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday she would launch the investigation, assigning the US attorney in New York’s Southern District, to lead it. The move raised fears among critics that the president was seeking to use the Justice Department to politicize any investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Massie said earlier Sunday he thought Trump was “trying to protect a bunch of rich and powerful friends, billionaires, donors to his campaign, friends in his social circles” and told his fellow GOP lawmakers that the “record of this vote will last longer” than Trump’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, who said he’s hoping around 40 Republican lawmakers will vote to release all the Epstein files this week, insisted earlier Sunday that Trump had been “sowing the seeds for his own lame-duck presidency” by going after Republicans who support the release of the files, such as Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s out of touch with his own base,” Khanna said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” before Trump urged Republicans to vote for the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, once a staunch Trump ally, has fallen  out of favor with the president  over her support for the release of files. Trump said Friday that he would no longer support and endorse Greene, who is running for reelection in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, for her part, lamented the fracture, insisting on Sunday that the rift “has all come down to the Epstein files.” She told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that she didn’t understand why the president was fighting the files’ release, as she doesn’t believe he has been implicated in anything illegal.\n \n\n   \n  “That is the question everyone is asking, is, ‘Why fight this so hard?’” Greene said.\n \n\n   \n  While the House bill to release the files is expected to pass, it awaits an uncertain fate in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Sunday whether he thinks the Senate would take up the effort, Massie said he hopes Thune will “do the right thing,” insisting that “pressure is going to be there if we get a big vote in the House.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Annie Grayer and Manu Raju contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/trump-sued-over-plans-to-paint-eisenhower-building-in-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Preservationists Sue Over Trump’s Latest Plans to Refashion a Federal Building to Match His Aesthetic","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preservationists, including the DC Preservation League and Cultural Heritage Partners, have sued President Donald Trump over his plan to paint the Eisenhower Executive Office Building white, arguing that such changes would violate federal historic preservation laws and cause irreversible damage to the structure.

It’d be a great addition to Washington,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plans to paint the building signaled yet another effort to stamp his aesthetic tastes on structures on federal grounds. As part of those efforts, Trump has paved over the White House Rose Garden to create a Mar-a-Lago-esque patio, demolished the East Wing to  create a massive ballroom , and ordered the golden pillars of the Kennedy Center painted white. He has also touted plans to  install a triumphal arch  to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United State’s founding.\n \n\n   \n  The suit argues the Trump administration cannot move forward with the president’s plans without going through “the environmental and historic preservation review that federal law requires.”\n \n\n   \n  Going around those reviews could result in irreversible damage, the groups argue. Painting stone “can trap moisture within the wall system” and accelerate deterioration, the suit says. It adds that if the building was painted, “removing paint from the natural granite and slate would require immense expense” and potentially result in the loss of the original material.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed plans of a white Eisenhower building “looked like a giant marshmallow,” said Greg Werkheiser, founding partner of Cultural Heritage Partners, the law firm that filed the suit.\n \n\n   \n  “But our complaint isn’t about the president’s taste,” Werkheiser said. “You can have really bad taste. You can have really good taste. What we’re asking for is you comply with the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Completed in 1888, the Eisenhower building originally housed the State, War and Navy departments, but now serves as ancillary office space for the president’s staff, including the Office of the Vice President, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget. The building’s interior includes 553 ornately gilded rooms, bronze stair balusters, hand-painted tiles, carved wooden fixtures, stained glass rotundas and intricate cast iron.\n \n\n   \n  But the building’s unique French Second Empire style has been controversial since its inception. It took roughly 17 years to build, and by the time it was done, “the Second Empire style had fallen from favor, and (architect Alfred) Mullett’s masterpiece was perceived by capricious Victorians as only an embarrassing reminder of past whims in architectural preference,”  according to  the Biden White House.\n \n\n   \n  Guides leading tourists around the White House complex are often heard quoting from the author Mark Twain, who reportedly described it as “the ugliest building in America.”\n \n\n   \n  And President Harry Truman called it a “monstrosity.”\n \n\n   \n  Werkheiser’s firm will ask for a preliminary injunction Monday on an emergency basis — but it will also ask the judge to issue a restraining order to prevent Trump from ordering alterations to the building until the court evaluates the case.\n \n\n   \n  Werkheiser’s team will seek to make the case that the Constitution “says the president is obligated to take care, to follow the laws,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “After the East Wing debacle, no reasonable person could say, ‘Well the president wasn’t on notice that these laws apply or that he needed to take additional care,’” he said. “The extensiveness of the outrage of that incident eliminates any excuse he has to pretend he can go quickly and avoid this process.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/sport/football-nfl-kris-boyd-jets","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00-05:00","title":"New York Jets Cornerback Kris Boyd Shot Outside Restaurant in NYC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kris Boyd, a cornerback for the New York Jets, was shot in the stomach outside a restaurant on 38th Street near 7th Avenue in New York City around 2 a.m. on November 16, 2025, during a dispute that escalated into a shooting.

White highlighted in the beloved book, in a statement Martha White shared with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandfather “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons,” said White, who is also her grandfather’s literary executor, in the statement. “He didn’t condone fearmongering.”\n \n\n   \n  And even as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who is from North Carolina, leaned into the “Charlotte’s Web” messaging  Sunday in an X post , Martha White slammed the agency for riding on the book’s coattails with a message antithetical to the story her grandfather told.\n \n\n   \n  “He believed in the rule of law and due process,” Martha White said of her grandfather.\n \n\n   \n  The move into North Carolina comes as agents have arrested thousands across the nation, including dozens in Charlotte, in immigration raids and deported nearly 200,000 people as of late August. The controversy highlights   the tension between the Trump administration efforts to arrest and deport immigrants it deems criminals and the work of civic and community groups highlighting residents’ rights.   \n \n\n   \n  The operation in Charlotte seeks to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,”  according to DHS .\n \n\n   \n  The crackdowns have led to sharp criticism from politicians and community organizations alike.\n \n\n   \n  “In Charlotte, we’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots, and off of our sidewalks,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein   said in a  social media message .\n \n\n   \n  Bovino cited Charlotte’s Web in his X post that gave a nod to agents involved in the operation: “Wherever the wind takes us. High, low. Near, far. East, west. North, south. We take to the breeze, we go as we please.” In the book, that’s when Charlotte’s babies hatch and fly off, leaving Wilbur to cry himself to sleep, only to find out the next morning that three spiders stayed to keep him company.\n \n\n   \n  White highlighted the message of generosity and inclusion that permeates the children’s tale: ‘“By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a little,” Charlotte says in the book. “Heaven knows anyone’s life can stand a little of that.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on Martha White’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    “Operation Charlotte’s Web” kicks off with 81 arrests\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte is the latest city in the Trump adminstration’s crosshairs to face an immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents on Saturday arrested 81 people in the city during a surge of immigration enforcement,  Bovino said Sunday .\n \n\n   \n  The arrests took place during a span of about five hours on Saturday, according to Bovino, who has been tasked with helping lead the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in multiple US cities.\n \n\n   \n  Many of those who were arrested over the weekend “had significant criminal and immigration history, are off the streets,”  Bovino said on X .\n \n\n   \n  Several businesses closed temporarily after the operation was announced, including a popular Colombian bakery that had shuttered its doors only once in the past 28 years.\n \n\n   \n  “I need to protect my customers. I need to protect my people. I need to protect myself and my family,” said Manuel “Manolo” Betancur, who closed his family bakery Saturday after seeing men in green uniforms chase and tackle people outside the shop. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.\n \n\n   \n    Mom criticized use of daughter’s story for “Operation Midway Blitz”\n \n\n   \n   It’s not the first time Trump administration has been criticized for basing the name for an immigration operation on  someone’s story.\n \n\n   \n  The mother of the woman who became the face of Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago said  last month  her daughter would not have wanted to be associated with the crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security  said  it launched the enforcement push in honor of Katie Abraham, an Illinois woman who authorities say was killed in a drunken-driving hit-and-run crash by a man who was in the US illegally.\n \n\n   \n  Her mother, Denise Lorence, decided to speak out after realizing the operation’s association with her daughter wasn’t going away, she wrote in an  op-ed for the Chicago Tribune .\n \n\n   \n  “Losing a child unlocked a pain I never knew existed.

Marjorie Taylor Greene said Sunday she will stop using “toxic” rhetoric, marking what would be a dramatic shift in a political brand hallmarked by derogatory comments.\n \n\n   \n  The commitment comes amid a rift with Donald Trump that has spilled into  public view , with the president attacking the Georgia Republican personally. Greene, meanwhile, has pivoted away from the Republican Party more broadly recently, criticizing the GOP on a number of fronts, including the party’s handling of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, Greene said she worried Trump’s rhetoric toward her could lead to violence against her.\n \n\n   \n  “The most hurtful thing (Trump) said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor, and that is so extremely wrong,” Greene said, “and those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed by Bash on why she didn’t speak out against Trump using such rhetoric until it was directed at her, Greene conceded that it was “fair criticism.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics; it’s very bad for our country,” Greene said. “It’s been something I’ve thought about a lot, especially since Charlie Kirk was assassinated.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene said she realized that she has participated in or supported heated rhetoric that has resulted in threats toward others, a point of reflection for her.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m only responsible for myself and my own words and actions … and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” Greene said. “I really want to just see people be kind to one another.”\n \n\n   \n    A long history of flagrant remarks\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s pivot represents a sharp departure from her typical conservative firebrand persona. She has previously spread offensive rhetoric about the Holocaust, lobbed personal insults during congressional proceedings and fought with fellow Republicans to the point her own caucus has pushed for  repercussions  for her acting out.\n \n\n   \n  Greene repeatedly indicated support for Facebook posts calling for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019, before she was elected to Congress, a CNN KFile  report revealed  in 2021. After CNN reached out to Greene at the time, her personal Twitter account posted a statement that did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments, but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page. The report  resulted in  her being removed from House committee assignments  until 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Also in 2021,  Greene compared  then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to continue to require House lawmakers to wear masks on the chamber floor to steps the Nazis took to control the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Greene  issued  a rare apology after that incident.\n \n\n   \n  She  was also ejected  from the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2023 in part because of fights she had with its members. She later brushed off her ouster, saying she didn’t “have time for the drama club.”\n \n\n   \n  In one of her more notorious incidents, Greene got into a fight during a committee markup in 2024, during which  she insulted   Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s personal appearance and verbally sparred with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n \n\n   \n  Greene refused to apologize when given the opportunity by the committee’s chair. The majority of Republicans on the panel eventually voted to allow Greene to continue speaking during the markup, though Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado joined Democrats in voting to have Greene silenced for the rest of the period.\n \n\n   \n  That was not the only time Boebert and Greene had a public disagreement. During an argument on the House floor in 2023, Greene  called Boebert  “a little b*tch.”\n \n\n   \n  Beyond her colleagues, Greene also  snapped  at a British journalist to “go back to your country” after the reporter asked about the Signal chat controversy involving Trump administration officials earlier this year\n \n\n   \n  Greene said Sunday she’s done participating in politics in that way, adding that America needs to find “a new path forward,” and calling on people “to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/reverend-jesse-jackson-hospitalized-psp","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00Z","title":"Rev.

with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  The designation, which will be effective November 24, comes as the United States has  ramped up its military presence  in the Caribbean, including with the arrival of the world’s largest aircraft carrier on Sunday. Tensions have risen between President Donald Trump and Maduro as US forces target alleged drug-trafficking operations, with the US conducting its  21st known strike  against an alleged drug boat over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested Sunday that designating Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization allows the US military the ability to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “It allows us to do that, but we haven’t said we’re going to do that,” Trump told reporters. “We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out.”\n \n\n   \n  “They would like to talk,” he said, without elaborating further.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump signaled on Friday that he had made a decision on military actions regarding Venezuela, he was noncommittal on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also said Sunday he doesn’t believe the administration needs congressional authorization for potential military actions inside Venezuela. Rather, the president said he would like to keep lawmakers informed without a say.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to keep Congress involved. I mean, we’re stopping drug dealers and drugs from coming into our country. … We don’t have to get their approval. But I think letting them know is good,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported  skepticism from some experts  on the legality of the boat strikes, as the United States has not declared war against Venezuela. The terrorist organization designation authorizes a US president to impose sanctions but doesn’t explicitly authorize the use of lethal force.\n \n\n   \n  However, the foreign terrorist organization designation is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism designations. It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US.\n \n\n   \n  Congress has  seven days  to review the foreign terrorist organization designation after being notified, and “in the absence of Congressional action to block the designation,” it then takes effect, according to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Rubio  said  the foreign terrorist organization designation gave the United States the right to “target these groups.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug-dealing organizations. Drug dealing is the kind of terrorism they’re doing, and it’s not the only,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department’s announcement comes after the US Treasury Department sanctioned Cartel de los Soles in July, deeming it a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” organization and alleging it “provided material support to Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the Treasury, “The cartel’s name is derived from the sun insignias often portrayed on the uniforms of Venezuelan military officials.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi put out a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro  to face US drug charges . She has  not presented conclusive evidence  of the Venezuelan leader’s alleged role in international drug trafficking. Caracas has flatly rejected the claims.\n \n\n   \n  “Cartel de los Soles, per se, doesn’t exist. It’s a journalistic expression created to refer to the involvement of Venezuelan authorities in drug trafficking,” Phil Gunson, a researcher with the International Crisis Group based in Caracas, previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But this doesn’t mean there aren’t military personnel or government officials involved in drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  “The cartels are here, the Colombians and the Mexicans, too. There are drug shipments via the Orinoco River and by air through clandestine airstrips, flights from Apure to Central America, and so on. All of this wouldn’t be possible without direct involvement from above,” Gunson said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon, Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood, Katie Bo Lillis, Natasha Bertrand and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/china/china-japan-taiwan-takaichi-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-20:18","title":"China warns citizens against Japan travel as Taiwan spat escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has issued a travel warning to its citizens against visiting Japan, citing the provocative remarks of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who stated that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival.

citizens against Japan travel as Taiwan spat escalates \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:16 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has warned its citizens against traveling to Japan as it escalates a backlash over comments by the country’s prime minister about the island of Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The dictum is Beijing’s most substantive retaliation yet to Sanae Takaichi’s remarks. Even as it may be more symbolic than anything, the move suggests Beijing is willing to wield its economic heft to press geopolitical points, a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  Recent “blatantly provocative remarks on Taiwan” have “further damaged the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges… creating additional risks to the safety and security of Chinese citizens in Japan,” a statement published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The ministry and its missions “remind Chinese citizens to refrain from visiting Japan for the time being,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Following the announcement, a number of Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern on Saturday published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Education also  advised its citizens  to exercise caution when making plans to study in Japan, citing a “worsening public security situation” in the country and claiming there had been a “surge in crimes targeting Chinese nationals.”\n \n\n   \n  The moves by Beijing are its latest displays of outrage in a  roughly week-long row  after Takaichi, in response to a question in Japan’s parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  China’s Ministry of Defense on Friday separately warned that Japan would “suffer a crushing defeat” if it dared to intervene militarily in the Taiwan Strait.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s travel warning was mirrored on Saturday by authorities in the financial hub Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, with residents there  urged  to exercise caution in visiting Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  The travel advisory follows official protest from both sides related to the incident – with each country summoning the other’s ambassador – and a surge of vitriolic backlash against Takaichi from within China, where nationalist, anti-Japanese sentiment has been on the rise in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The falling-out comes less than two weeks after Takaichi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for the first time on the sidelines of an international summit and agreed to pursue constructive, stable ties.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A heavy price’\n \n\n   \n  The backlash was kicked off by China’s Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian, who last Saturday shared a news article about Takaichi’s remarks and commented “the dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  State media has since published a barrage of scathing commentaries and editorials, while rampant social media discussion has disparaged Takaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  A commentary from the People’s Liberation Army Daily published Saturday attacked Takaichi and said if Japan intervened militarily in the Taiwan Strait, China would give it a “head-on blow.” A PLA-affiliated X account also circulated comments translated into Japanese warning Japan would “pay a heavy price” in such a case.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo on Friday summoned China’s ambassador to Japan to protest Xue’s “highly inappropriate remarks” and demand Beijing take “appropriate actions,” its foreign ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing had a day prior summoned Japan’s ambassador to China, in a meeting where Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong said Takaichi’s comments had “seriously damaged the political foundation of China-Japan relations,” and slammed Japan for not retracting them.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Friday said there was no need to retract Takaichi’s comments, stressing that they were made within the context of a discussion on an “existential crisis situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Separately on Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important not only for Japan’s security but also for the stability of the international community.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Takaichi said her remarks were “hypothetical” and that she would refrain from making similar comments in parliament again.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, which is widely seen as aiming to establish itself as the dominant power in the region, looks warily at the American alliance with Japan when it comes to its own regional security and ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has called for closer security ties with the US and last month moved to accelerate the country’s defense build-up, but like previous Japanese prime ministers she must balance the country’s close economic ties to China.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/style/south-korea-samsung-art-smithsonian-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:48:00-05:00","title":"South Korea’s latest soft-power export?

Late Samsung billionaire Lee Kun-hee’s vast art collection \n       \n  By Christy Choi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:48 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For more than seven decades, the family behind electronics giant Samsung amassed one of Asia’s largest private art collections. Now, with thousands of its priceless works in public hands following the death of the conglomerate’s chairman, the collection is being put to new use — as part of South Korea’s “ K-culture ” soft-power drive.\n \n\n   \n  More than 200 of the 23,000 objects  gifted to the country  in 2021 by the late Lee Kun-hee’s estate — thought to be part of a deal to settle an inheritance tax bill of over 12 trillion won ($8.2 billion) — are going on display at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC this month.\n \n\n   \n  Spanning 1,500 years, the items selected by the Smithsonian’s curators for “ Korean Treasures: Collected, Cherished, Shared ” give visitors a glimpse of the roots and evolution of Korea’s modern identity, as well as the motivations of the notoriously private Lee family.\n \n\n   \n  The objects range from rare Buddhist sculptures and sacred texts to antique furniture and 20th-century paintings by pioneering artists like Lee Ungno and Kim Whanki, who curators say redefined Korean painting in a modernizing world.\n \n\n   \n  The Lee Kun-hee collection, which was started by its namesake’s father, Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul, is unprecedented in its scope and scale. Almost all the 23,000 donated items went to the National Museum of Korea and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, whose curators collaborated with the Smithsonian for this exhibition. After the gift was announced, South Korea’s government unveiled plans for an entire  new museum  in Seoul to display the collection, which it hopes will “strengthen Korea’s brand identity as a cultural powerhouse.”\n \n\n   \n  The Washington, DC exhibition includes several sections dedicated to Korea’s last royal kingdom, the Joseon dynasty, which lasted from 1392 to 1910. Curators showcase the tastes and morals of the scholarly elite through court art and ceremonial objects, offering a look at the ideals, aesthetics and patronage systems that shaped Korean culture. The show also considers Buddhism and its legacy on the Korean peninsula, as well as modern artists’ attempts to grapple with the  Korean War  and monumental changes happening in the country and globally.\n \n\n   \n    An identity formed\n \n\n   \n  Some items from the Washington, DC exhibition will also be displayed in Chicago and London next year amid growing global fascination with all things Korean, from  K-beauty  to K-pop.\n \n\n   \n  “It is fantastic that Korea is making this global contribution to popular culture the way it is, but you know, Korean culture didn’t start 10 or 15 years ago, right?” said Chase F. Robinson, director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art, over a video call. “There are deep, deep reservoirs or veins of, especially, Korean visual culture. This is an opportunity to see that in play.”\n \n\n   \n  The exhibition, Robinson added, will “play an important role in filling out that understanding, and (in) seeing some of those pre-modern traditions that feed into these millennia of creative dynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  The theme is particularly relevant given the growing size, influence and cultural power of Asian American communities in the United States, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the objects are being exhibited outside of Korea for the first time, organizers said.\n \n\n   \n  “That there is this heritage that is so multi-dimensional and so rich — to bring it all together and show the significance — I think is what is notable, remarkable,” said Carol Huh, the museum’s associate curator of contemporary Asian art, over a video call.\n \n\n   \n  Huh’s interest and specialty is the work of 20th- and 21st-century artists who addressed modernization and a rapidly changing political landscape. It is a period in which Korea, having had very little contact with the wider world for centuries, suddenly found itself being influenced by forces and trends far beyond its immediate neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  Within 100 years, the country went from being an imperial dynasty to a Japanese colony, to two independent states after the peninsula was divided into a Russian-controlled north and US-administered south after World War II. South Korea is now a liberal democracy, while the North is a totalitarian state run by Kim Jong Un.\n \n\n   \n  “They were very much at the core of this complicated history of trying to understand what it is to be an artist in Korea,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Huh said the Lees’ bequest fills a gap in the history of contemporary Korean art with work by nearly 300 20th-century artists included. It was, she added, a period of identifying and asserting distinctly Korean cultural forms.\n \n\n   \n  Among the Smithsonian’s selection is work by artists like Kim Whanki, a well-known figure in the monochrome Dansaekhwa movement, whose members — having lived through Korea’s liberation from Japan, a civil war and the military dictatorship — used abstraction to avoid explicit meaning in their images, partly out of fear of strict government censorship. Also featured is Lee Ungno and Park Saengkwang, part of the antithetical Minjung art (or “the people’s” art) movement, which sought to advance democracy and social justice in the 1970s and 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  The Lee family “presciently sought out modern paintings at a time when only a few paid attention to them,” reads the exhibition catalog.\n \n\n   \n    A legacy collected\n \n\n   \n  Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul was partly motivated by the desire to repatriate art from Korean history. Many of the artifacts he acquired had, over the centuries, been sent abroad, lost or actively erased by the colonial Japanese government, which had even sought to outlaw the Korean language.\n \n\n   \n  “The cultural heritage of our nation should no longer be scattered or lost abroad,” he wrote in his autobiography.\n \n\n   \n  The Lees have made various gifts to museums across South Korea in recent decades. And even after its vast 2021 donation, the family retains a sizeable private collection, some of which is on display at the Samsung-run Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, where the family continues its collecting legacy.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Kun-hee’s art acquisitions were not without controversy: In 2007, he was accused by Kim Yong-chul, a former Samsung lawyer, of buying expensive artworks using company slush funds. That accusation, which Lee denied, set off an investigation into the former chairman that saw him convicted of tax evasion in 2008 (though prosecutors never brought bribery charges relating to the alleged slush funds).\n \n\n   \n  Like some of the artists in its collection, the Lee family also appeared to grapple with what it means to be Korean in a globalized era, and the collection gives glimpses into what the Lees, and their advisors, saw as part of Korean identity — and what they sought to project to the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Kun-hee is quoted in the exhibition catalog as saying: “When Korean identity permeates our daily lives, we will gain cultural competitiveness on the world stage.”\n \n\n   \n  His father, meanwhile, was known to write about how artworks excited him when he needed a spiritual lift, or would calm him down when he was excited or upset, said J. Keith Wilson, the Smithsonian’s curator of ancient Chinese art.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly, he had a very personal connection with Korean art of the past and was able to communicate with it in what seems to be like a spiritual way,” Wilson added.\n \n\n   \n   “ Korean Treasures: Collected, Cherished, Shared ” is showing at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC through February 1, 2026.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/americas/chile-election-presidential-runoff-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:11:00-05:00","title":"Chile’s Presidential Race Headed to Tense Runoff Between Communist and Hard-Right Candidates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chile’s presidential election has advanced to a tense runoff between Jeannette Jara, a center-left communist candidate and former labor minister, and José Antonio Kast, a hard-right former lawmaker with strong anti-immigration and anti-abortion views.

headed to tense runoff between communist and hard-right candidates \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:11 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Chile is headed to a tense presidential runoff after a  closely fought first-round  vote Sunday set up a showdown between a member of the Communist Party and an ultraconservative veteran politician, sharply polarizing the country between the political left and right.\n \n\n   \n  Jeannette Jara, 51, the communist former labor minister and candidate of Chile’s center-left governing coalition, claimed 26.7% of valid ballots with over 90% of the vote counted, failing to pass the 50% threshold to secure victory in the first round.\n \n\n   \n  José Antonio Kast, 59, a hard-right former lawmaker and devout Catholic opposed to same-sex marriage and abortion, captured more than 24.1% of the vote, underscoring the resilience of his law-and-order platform as a surge in organized crime rattles one of Latin America’s safest nations and foments anti-migrant sentiment among Chileans.\n \n\n   \n  After learning he would advance to the next round, Kast urged the fractured right-wing to unite behind him, framing the runoff as an existential struggle for Chile’s future.\n \n\n   \n  “It will be the most important election of our generation, a true referendum between two models of society — the current one that has led Chile to destruction, stagnation, violence,” he told fans, interrupted by cheers every few seconds. “And our model, which promotes freedom, hope and progress.”\n \n\n   \n  Jara had a very different message. “This is a great country,” she told supporters in downtown Santiago, the capital. “Don’t let fear freeze your hearts.”\n \n\n   \n    Crime, immigration boost the right\n \n\n   \n  An admirer of US President Donald Trump and Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro, Kast has vowed to deport tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and construct hundreds of kilometers of ditches and walls along Chile’s northern border with Bolivia to prevent people from crossing, particularly from crisis-stricken Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “We want change, and that change today is about security,” José Hernández, the 60-year-old owner of an agricultural company said after casting his ballot for Kast.\n \n\n   \n  Although voters gave Jara a slight edge on Sunday, Kast will benefit in the second round from a large share of votes that went to three eliminated right-wing challengers who campaigned aggressively on the need to tackle illegal immigration.\n \n\n   \n  The third- and fourth-placed candidates were Franco Parisi, a right-leaning populist economist with a large social media following, and Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian and former YouTube provocateur elected as lawmaker in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Chile’s constitution does not allow reelection to consecutive terms, so left-wing  President Gabriel Boric,  whose presidency ends in March, is not standing.\n \n\n   \n  Like her opponents, Jara has called insecurity a top priority, promoting plans to deport foreigners convicted of drug trafficking, boost security along Chile’s borders and tackle money laundering.\n \n\n   \n  “On the question of more jails, more punishments, more imprisonment, closing borders, restricting migrants, there is no debate anymore between the right and left,” said Lucía Dammert, a political scientist and Boric’s first chief of staff.\n \n\n   \n   “But it’s an issue that always enhances the right, everywhere in Latin America.”\n \n\n   \n    Winning over wary voters\n \n\n   \n  The race now goes to a second round on December 14. Analysts believe the starkly opposed Jara and Kast will tack to the middle ground in order to broaden their appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “We will definitely see Jara and Kast after today being even more moderate, talking about things that voters care about and trying to compete for the center,” said Rodolfo Disi, a political scientist at Chile’s Adolfo Ibáñez University.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next month, Jara faces the challenge of winning over voters concerned about her lifelong membership in Chile’s Communist party, which supports authoritarian governments in Cuba and Venezuela. Jara came under fire early on in her campaign for referring to Cuba as a democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “We liked her at first, but that moment was when our opinion shifted, it seemed like a really closed-minded view,” Camila Roure, 29, said outside a polling station. But as a woman, Roure said, she wouldn’t vote for Kast — given his history of opposition to divorce and abortion, even in cases of rape.\n \n\n   \n  Although Kast has more recently sought to deflect attention from what he calls traditional family values and his  German-born father’s  Nazi past – which mobilized progressive voters against him during his last two failed presidential bids – he has made clear his views remain the same.\n \n\n   \n  “A Kast government wouldn’t just be a political shift, it would be a huge step backward,” said Macarena Breke, 27, an English teacher voting for Jara.\n \n\n   \n    Jara promises a social safety net\n \n\n   \n  President Boric, the young, tattooed ex-student protest leader who came to power in 2021 vowing to “bury neoliberalism” on the  heels of mass unrest over inequality , has faced criticism from allies and rivals alike that his government failed to fulfill its sweeping promises of social change.\n \n\n   \n  Economic discontent is simmering in one of Latin America’s most prosperous nations, with growth sluggish and unemployment up over 8.5%. The country retains its dictatorship-era constitution after voters rejected a government-backed charter that would have transformed Chile into one of the world’s most progressive societies.\n \n\n   \n  But Boric’s government has several landmark welfare measures to show for itself — many of them thanks to Jara.\n \n\n   \n  As labor minister, she raised the minimum wage, boosted pensions and shortened the workweek to 40 from 45 hours.\n \n\n   \n  “The right is trying to sell this idea that the country is collapsing. But I don’t see that,” said Loreta Sleir, a 27-year-old who voted for Jara.\n \n\n   \n  To address Chile’s cost-of-living crisis — which in 2019 helped fuel the country’s most significant social upheaval since the 1990 fall of Gen. Augusto Pinochet’s bloody dictatorship — Jara proposes a “living” monthly income of around $800 through state subsidies and minimum wage hikes. She promises to invest in big infrastructure projects and new housing.\n \n\n   \n    Kast promises to shrink the state\n \n\n   \n  Kast proposes quite the opposite.\n \n\n   \n  Taking a page from the playbook of President  Javier Milei  in neighboring Argentina, he vows to shrink the public payroll, eliminate government ministries, slash corporate taxes and get rid of regulations.\n \n\n   \n  He says he’ll make a staggering $6 billion in spending cuts over 18 months — a bid which, even if far-fetched, appeals to voters disconcerted by repeated fiscal deficits in a country long hailed as a regional success story for extreme laissez-faire economics.\n \n\n   \n  “The money disappears, the left spends it I don’t know what, human rights, and I can barely afford rent,” said Jorge Ruiz, 48, a cab driver who voted for Kast.\n \n\n   \n  Chile’s 2% deficit this year pales in comparison to the economic woes elsewhere in the region — like in Argentina, where President Trump recently helped halt a currency crisis.\n \n\n   \n   But the repeated deficits are rare for a country long hailed as a regional success story for extreme laissez-faire economics, a model established by Pinochet and sustained for decades after his dictatorship’s downfall.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/gluesenkamp-perez-garcia-retirement","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:43:00Z","title":"Lawmaker calls for accountability over timing of fellow House Democrat’s retirement: ‘Election subversion is wrong’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Rep.

average, making this the driest Autumn Iran has experienced in the past 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  The  cloud-seeding  operation was carried out “by aircraft equipped with cloud seeding equipment” in the Lake Urmia basin in the northwest of the country, IRNA said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a process used in Iran for years, in which chemicals are dispersed into clouds to stimulate the release of moisture as rain.\n \n\n   \n  This comes as Iran experiences one of its worst droughts on record, and its fifth consecutive year of drought.  Key reservoirs are shrinking  as rainfall is at record lows, and authorities are scrambling to reduce water consumption, and residents are desperately trying to conserve it to stave off catastrophe.\n \n\n   \n   Just two decades ago , Lake Urmia was the Middle East’s largest lake, and its local economy thrived with hotels and restaurants catering to tourists. Now, boats sit rusted and immobile on land that is rapidly turning into a salt plain.\n \n\n   \n  Climate change is making an already severe situation significantly worse.\n \n\n   \n  An acute water crisis “has even raised alarms about drinking-water supplies in major cities, including the capital Tehran,” Iran’s state-run Press TV said in a report on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Mohammad Mehdi Javadian-Zadeh, the head of the National Cloud-Seeding Research Center, said these cloud-seeding operations will continue until mid-May “whether by airplane or drone, and if suitable systems exist in the country,” as cited by IRNA.\n \n\n   \n  “Considering that our country is located in arid regions and the urgent need for renewable water resources, cloud seeding is only performed to increase precipitation in various catchment basins,” Javadian-Zadeh added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/india/india-arrest-delhi-bomb-kashmir-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"India arrests Kashmir resident in connection with deadly Red Fort bomb attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested a resident of India-administered Kashmir linked to a deadly car bombing near Delhi’s Red Fort on November 16, 2025, which killed at least 10 people and injured over 30.

late singer \n       \n  By Sofía Hanalei Sanchez\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  First, there was the 1997 Gregory Nava biopic starring Jennifer Lopez. Then, there was the  scripted Netflix series  that came out in 2020. Now, the late Queen of Tejano music,  Selena Quintanilla Perez , is having her story told directly by her family and bandmates.\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, we have her sister Suzette Quintanilla to thank for “Selena y Los Dinos,” the Netflix documentary debuting Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the annoying one with the camera, like, back in the day,” Quintanilla told CNN in a recent interview. “I have so much footage of all the guys giving me that look like, ‘Ugh, not again.’”\n \n\n   \n  In the ‘80s and ‘90s, Quintanilla, now the CEO of her family’s entertainment company Q Productions, was the drummer in her family’s up-and-coming band, which serves as the inspiration for the documentary’s title. She had a camera and a desire to document her family and bandmates’ silly moments on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “(I) wasn’t even thinking about creating (or) capturing these moments for what’s being showcased. It was just about documenting our life,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Those smile-stealing, off-the-cuff camcorder moments make what could have been a stale documentary into a much more personal portrait of the singer, who was  killed in 1995 . “Selena y Los Dinos” – inspired by the name of the band her father was in when he was a young musician – is packed with intimate glimpses of treasures from the family’s personal trove of video, photos and other never-before-seen footage.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a part in the documentary where I’m reading a letter that she wrote to me,” the late singer’s bandmate and eventual husband Chris Perez told CNN. “I was just happy to be a part of it and have the crew come over here and talk to me in that kind of respect.”\n \n\n   \n  Between home videos, deep-cut interviews, love letters – and even looks at Quintanilla Perez’s handwritten study notes from when she was learning Spanish to better connect with her Mexican audience – the documentary reminds viewers of the person behind the star’s story, which ended too soon.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary details the Texas-born singer’s triumphs and struggles in equal measure – like how she broke through sexism, racism and poverty in the male-dominated Tejano music scene in the late 1980s to become one of the first American musicians of Latino descent to cross over from the Spanish to English market. Her fifth studio album – featuring her two widely known English hits, “Dreaming of You” and “I Could Fall in Love” – was released after her death.\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, at the age of 23 and already a Grammy winner, Quintanilla Perez was shot and killed by her fan club president  Yolanda Saldívar, who was denied parole  earlier this year. Still, in her short life, she refracted light, relatability and charisma that continues to capture millions today.\n \n\n   \n  To put it all into context, before there was  Bad Bunny -mania, there was Ricky Martin’s Latin Explosion. And before that, there was Selena Quintanilla Perez.\n \n\n   \n  While all the fame, glory and tragedy is implicit in Selena’s story, the director of the new documentary was going for something more.\n \n\n   \n  “(The documentary is) not the ‘Hollywoodification’ of their story, it’s them telling their stories to you directly,” director Isabel Castro told CNN’s host of “First of All,” Victor Blackwell. “ It was really important to us that we make something that felt different from things that have been made in the past.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of those differences include a more complete picture of Quintanilla Perez as an empowered and empowering female artist in the early ’90s. In one archival snippet, an older, male host asks the young singer – wearing a scarlet red bustier and matching leggings – to do “a turn” for the audience. After doing a quick, elegant twirl, she requests the same of him, even encouraging the audience to egg him on. He does not spin, but her point was made.\n \n\n   \n  There are also candid moments from her childhood, including interviews in which she speaks honestly about the pressure on her and her siblings to financially deliver for the family.\n \n\n   \n  Directed by Castro and executive produced by siblings Suzette and AB Quintanilla III, the project captures Quintanilla Perez and her band’s rise and her ultimate triumph: a global legacy beyond her lifespan.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘real’ Selena\n \n\n   \n  Quintanilla Perez is not at risk of being forgotten any time soon, of course. Her name seemingly still carries the crowd-gathering power it did at the height of her popularity.\n \n\n   \n  When MAC Cosmetics launched a makeup collection inspired by the star, it  sold out within a day . The ceremony revealing her pink star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame attracted a  record-breaking attendance . And when Texas grocery store chain H-E-B released a limited quantity of special-edition reusable bags lines honoring the singer, the  website crashed and stores were sold out  for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  For Quintanilla, though, honoring her sister in the documentary was about highlighting the human more than the hype.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, the lasting interest in Quintanilla Perez has collided with more advanced tools, like  artificial intelligence,  in tributes that may give her a voice again in some ways, but still miss the resonant mark, according to Quintanilla.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I do see the AI stuff,” she said. “Some of the stuff is just incredible, but the beauty of what she brings as a person and as an artist, AI can never replicate that. They can emulate her physical look, but there ain’t nothing better than the real thing.”\n \n\n   \n  In true Mexican tradition, the “Amor Prohibido” singer’s story is being told – and retold – to new generations in hopes of her life never being forgotten.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s basically taking this time capsule and bringing it to 2025. I do understand the significance of the younger fan base that’s searching Selena and wanting to know more about her,” said Suzette Quintanilla. “And throughout the years, things have been blurred.”\n \n\n   \n  She added: “ I think that’s one of the reasons why this documentary is extremely important because if anybody is new that’s discovering Selena, they’re not discovering an AI version. Clearly, this is the real Selena.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-maduro-removal-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:34:00-05:00","title":"Trump likely to face long military commitment and chaos if he ousts Maduro in Venezuela, experts say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses concerns that President Donald Trump, who believes Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is on the verge of falling, could face significant challenges if he proceeds with land strikes or military intervention to remove Maduro.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:34 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has said he believes Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s days are numbered, and that land strikes inside Venezuela are possible.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the US doesn’t currently have the military assets in place to launch a largescale operation to remove Maduro from power, though Trump has approved covert action within Venezuela,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n  But if Trump did order strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, he could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency, according to experts, as well as political backlash at home for a president who promised to avoid costly entanglements overseas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Trump received a briefing earlier this week to review updated options for military action inside Venezuela, a concept the White House has been  weighing . The administration had not made a decision on whether to launch strikes, CNN reported, though the US military has moved more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded Operation Southern Spear in an announcement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The concentration of military assets and threats of further attacks beyond the  ongoing drug boat campaign  have served to increase pressure on Maduro, with administration officials saying he needs to leave office while arguing that he’s closely tied to the Tren de Aragua gang and leading drug trafficking efforts.\n \n\n   \n  But if Maduro does flee Venezuela or is killed out in a targeted strike, experts worry about a military takeover of the country or the boosting of another dictator similar to Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  There are other members of the Venezuelan Chavismo, the leftist political ideology of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez that Maduro has championed, who could take the reins and subject the country to even harsher rule, experts and former officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Maduro has said something to the effect of, ‘You want to get rid of me? You think things will get better?’ It is something to consider because Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo, and someone else could usurp power instead of the opposition with the backing of the military,” said Juan Gonzalez, a resident fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute who was a former Biden administration official focused on the region.\n \n\n   \n  Another possibility would be a military takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “If the military is still cohesive, and I don’t think we see any evidence it is not, they will not collapse because there is a challenge to or an ouster of Maduro,” said John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser in his first term. “They will follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, whose inner circle is made up of both civilians and military officers who are often in competition with each other, is known to have tight control over his administration and has helped stabilize competing factions. External forces, like Colombian insurgent groups who regularly operate from Venezuela or criminal syndicates linked to cocaine, gold and mineral trafficking further complicate the picture.\n \n\n   \n  Were Maduro to disappear, these pulls could tear the nation apart – descending into a potential civil war, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium,” said a Western diplomat who has spent years in Venezuela, asking to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss with the press. “Everyone knows he’s been politically dead since last year’s election, but if he leaves there’s nobody who can maintain the status quo … so they all close ranks around him.”\n \n\n   \n    Opposition Figures\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration may hope that Venezuelan opposition figures would be able to step into a power vacuum created by the removal of Maduro, something that the first Trump administration considered as it propped up Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. That first Trump administration officially recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela in 2019, but a failed coup attempt that year meant he never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  One current Venezuelan opposition group led by Edmundo Gonzalez, who ran for president last year in an election that  the US said Maduro lost , says it has a 100-hour plan to transition the power of Venezuela’s government from Maduro to Gonzalez. But experts say that they would be unable to succeed in the short-term or in the long-term without sustained US support – and potentially US boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible. There is no way to guarantee their safety or ability to govern without the US providing security,”  Juan Gonzalez said. “Everyone is viewing removing Maduro as the end but it’s really just the beginning of what would be a long, drawn-out process.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have also said that Edmuondo Gonzalez, who is currently residing in Spain, is the rightful leader of Venezuela, based on the results of last year’s election. The US has provided limited support to another Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who went into hiding in the country after the election. The assistance includes support, like gaining access to secure communication capabilities, former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  But in order to keep any of the potential opposition leaders in power the type of support needed from the US would go beyond providing a secure device – there would need to be assistance in reconstructing the army, unfreezing Venezuelan government funds and training their police force, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition’s enemies inside Venezuela are not limited to Maduro himself, which is why such sustained outside support is seen as a necessity, experts said. The opposition would face hostilities from the Venezuelan military; pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos; the National Liberation Army (known as the ELN), which is a Colombian guerilla group that currently has safe haven in the country; and other active criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how much support Trump would be willing to give any opposition leader who seeks to take the presidency from Maduro. But that support would need to be sustained, officials said, to fend off a failed state.\n \n\n   \n  Such an extended US military involvement runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump backs away from a potential opportunity to oust Maduro now, some believe it could be viewed as a lost opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump is calling Maduro a narcoterrorist and a drug trafficker, and has assembled a huge armada. If he backs down now and Maduro survives, there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine’ talk and the idea of being supreme in our own hemisphere.” said Elliott Abrams, a former senior State Department official in Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n    Entanglements\n \n\n   \n  Even while some say that displacing Maduro could be done without US troops on the ground for an extended period, they say that the US commitment following any kinetic strikes needs to be long-lasting or else the effort could easily fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “If the force is decisive it can disband a full army. But whatever is done cannot be done with a short-term perspective. The use of force needs to create a result and be connected to a political solution with US support, and planning for that support for 5-10 years,” said a regional diplomat.\n \n\n   \n  The Maduro regime is propped up in different ways by Russia, China and Cuba. Experts worry that if US strikes hit assets of those nations the conflict could quickly escalate. While it is unlikely that any of those nations would send their troops to the region to defend against US strikes, it is possible that the effect of US strikes inside Venezuela could be blunted by the support those countries provide to the regime.\n \n\n   \n  All three nations have invested in the Venezuelan regime and have instruments that they could bring to bear to prevent Maduro’s ouster, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  This is something that has happened in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2019, the opposition thought that the Cubans had uncovered what they were trying to do with their coup attempt and believe that they made moves to undermine their efforts,” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  Further expanding the problem could be a move by Maduro to hit US assets in the region – before the US makes any move to directly oust him.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a chance that if Maduro thinks he is going down he might make a move to hit something the US cares about, such as oil platforms in the Caribbean Sea. It could be a gamble he may be willing to take that would harm US interests in the region,” said Henry Ziemer, a regional expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Publicly the Trump administration continues to point to its buildup of military assets in Latin America as supremely focused on counter-drug operations – not an ouster of Maduro. Experts have also  previously told CNN  that the assembled hardware and troops aren’t enough for a full-scale invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Still, when asked earlier this month if the US might get into a war with Venezuela, Trump gave an ambiguous answer, saying: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/business/bessent-tariff-rebate-supreme-court-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:40:00-05:00","title":"Treasury Secretary Says ‘We Will See’ About $2,000 Rebate Checks to Americans as Supreme Court Weighs Trump’s Tariffs","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Donald Trump’s proposal to issue $2,000 tariff rebate checks to Americans would require congressional approval and is subject to legal uncertainty due to potential Supreme Court challenges over the use of emergency powers.

about $2,000 rebate checks to Americans as Supreme Court weighs Trump’s tariffs \n       \n  By Auzinea Bacon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:40 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s proposal to issue  $2,000 tariff rebate checks  to most Americans   would require Congress’ approval.\n \n\n   \n  “We will see. We need legislation for that,” Bessent said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” when asked about rebate checks, adding that “Those could go out.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly suggested using tariffs to fund rebate checks in recent months, including in a  Truth Social  post last weekend. “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! … A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” he wrote. Trump first floated the idea of Americans potentially  receiving a portion of the tariff revenue  in July.\n \n\n   \n  The payments would be “for working families” and would have an income limit, Bessent said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  But  the Supreme Court  could strike down a large chunk of Trump’s tariffs when it decides on the president’s use of an emergency law. The court appeared deeply concerned earlier this month with Trump’s reliance on the law, with several conservative justices picking apart the administration’s position.\n \n\n   \n  The tariffs have faced scrutiny for contributing to higher inflation on consumer goods, though Bessent and others in Trump’s economic team have denied that  tariffs are essentially a tax on American consumers .\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think this ruling is going to go against us, but if it does, what’s (the Supreme Court’s) plan for refunds? Because how is this going to get to consumers? Are they just going to hand some of these importers big windfalls?” Bessent said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think the Supreme Court wants to wade into a mess like that,” Bessent added.\n \n\n   \n    A trade agreement with China\n \n\n   \n  The United States has yet to sign a trade deal with China on rare-earth minerals, which are   essential to making consumer electronics and military equipment, after months of trade tensions between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent said a deal will “hopefully” be done by Thanksgiving after a framework agreement was  announced in October . That agreement averted additional 100% tariffs that the US threatened on Chinese goods, but only if Beijing ends current and proposed export controls on critical rare earths.   \n \n\n   \n  Bessent said Sunday that the agreement would allow rare earths to “flow freely as they did before April 4,” when the trade war kicked off due to Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs.\n \n\n   \n    Bessent says shutdown set back economy\n \n\n   \n  The longest government shutdown in US history  came to an end  Wednesday after Congress narrowly passed a spending package.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course the government shutdown set us back,” Bessent said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent did not say whether he expected a weak GDP for the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  The first two quarters of 2026, though, will see inflation down and the real income curve “substantially accelerate,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n  “When those two lines cross, Americans are going to feel it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    More expensive groceries leading into the holidays\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration on Friday announced that many agricultural imports would be  exempt from “reciprocal” tariffs  instead of rates as high as 50% on imports from Brazil or the lowest 10% duty imposed on many other countries, potentially providing a solution to rising grocery costs.\n \n\n   \n  Average grocery prices in the US were  2.7% higher in September  compared with last year. Coffee prices, for instance, were up nearly  21% year-over-year  in August, and bananas were about  6.6% more expensive in August  than they were a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “The prices will go down, of course … because the supply of goods into the US is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  The  consumer sentiment index fell  to 50.3 this month from 53.6 in October, according to the University of Michigan — a sobering sign leading into the holiday season.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/media/pbs-ken-burns-american-revolution-paula-kerger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-05:00","title":"PBS, defunded by Trump, says ‘we’re still here’ with big new Ken Burns documentary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite President Donald Trump’s successful effort to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), PBS has not collapsed, as demonstrated by the launch of Ken Burns’ six-part documentary 'The American Revolution'—a major cultural event premiering in November 2025.

with big new Ken Burns documentary \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:29 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sunday’s premiere of Ken Burns’ new PBS series “The American Revolution” doubles as an attention-grabbing statement, months after President Donald Trump succeeded in stripping away all federal funding for public broadcasting in the US.\n \n\n   \n  The message is clear: “We are still here.”\n \n\n   \n  The documentary, which airs over six consecutive nights, is “a really big moment” for PBS, said Paula Kerger, the organization’s CEO.\n \n\n   \n  There has been some marketplace confusion as a result of Trump’s campaign to defund public media.\n \n\n   \n  Since the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is winding down as a consequence of the funding cut, “people thought that meant that we were gone,” Kerger said.\n \n\n   \n  However, the big and loud marketing campaign for “The American Revolution” is proving otherwise.\n \n\n   \n  Despite painful layoffs and other cost-cutting measures, the public broadcasting system remains intact and is still capable of HBO- and Netflix-sized moments, such as the latest from Burns.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Water under the American bridge’\n \n\n   \n  “The American Revolution,” pegged to America’s 250th anniversary celebration in 2026, has been in the works for 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  “We began this in December of 2015 when Barack Obama had 13 months to go in his presidency,” Burns told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “There’s been a lot of water under the American bridge during this time.”\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term in office, he repeatedly proposed eliminating funding for the CPB, but congressional Republicans preserved the funds, in part to protect the local stations serving their constituents.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was much more aggressive this year, however. Driven by his disdain for PBS and NPR news coverage, Trump pushed GOP lawmakers to rescind already-allocated funds for the CPB, which is the private entity that disburses taxpayer funds to local NPR and PBS stations across the country.\n \n\n   \n  That rescission passed in July, and the federal funds dried up in October, marking an end to nearly 60 years of federal government support for public media.\n \n\n   \n  Some local stations are more affected than others. Those in bigger markets generally have more donors and other sources of revenue; those in smaller markets have fewer such resources. Public media officials have warned that stations in rural and hard-to-reach areas are at particular risk of going off the airwaves in the months and years ahead.\n \n\n   \n  In the short term, however, emergency grants and loans from the Knight Foundation and other philanthropies are helping replace some of the lost funds.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on stage at the Texas Tribune Festival, Kerger said that fundraising “has actually gone pretty well,” emphasizing that PBS is still pushing Congress to restore funding in the future.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe we can get some of that money back,” Kerger said. “And I’m going to certainly fight like crazy” for it.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Where’d you come from?’\n \n\n   \n  The rescission took effect as Burns was beginning his nationwide tour for “The American Revolution.”\n \n\n   \n  The six-part, twelve-hour series is the highest-profile PBS premiere in years, garnering multiple weeks of publicity, including advance screenings across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the kind of work that public broadcasting is built to do,” Kerger said. She recounted a recent screening in Washington, where conservative lawmakers stood alongside progressives wanting to meet Burns.\n \n\n   \n  “It bugged me a little bit that some of them voted against us and they were still waiting to shake Ken’s hand,” Kerger remarked, “but the point is they recognize that what he’s doing is important.”\n \n\n   \n  A sweeping production like “The American Revolution” involves a long list of private donors, as well as support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n \n\n   \n  During the congressional debate over the summer, Burns personally called some Republican lawmakers to try to salvage the funding.\n \n\n   \n  “I couldn’t do any of the films I’ve done without them being on PBS,” he told CBS at the time.\n \n\n   \n  James Poniewozik,  reviewing the series  for The New York Times, wrote that “it is dedicated to a belief that seems increasingly old-fashioned: that we share a common story and that people are willing to hear it, both the good and the bad.”\n \n\n   \n  Burns told Cooper that reflecting on your roots, as the series does, can be a source of strength and power.\n \n\n   \n  “When you feel like we’re challenged, as we do now, that we’re divided, you go back, as a person would, to a therapist and ask, ‘Where’d you come from?’ And going back to our origin story gives us the opportunity to help repair, maybe revitalize what it was that we were originally involved in, to dispel some of the myths about it and to also help understand how extraordinary those people were.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/americas/genz-protests-mexico-sheinbaum-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:25:00-05:00","title":"Thousands protest crime and corruption in Mexico City as ‘Gen Z’ protests gain momentum","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of people, including members of Generation Z, gathered in Mexico City to protest against rising crime, corruption, and political impunity.

Now he’s a father facing deportation to Ukraine \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:37 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was prompt in picking up his two daughters from school every afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to him to be there for his smiley 3- and 5-year-old girls, peppering them with questions about what they learned and who they played with.\n \n\n   \n  At home with his wife Samantha, he would always be facilitating the bubbles at bath time, meticulously brushing out tiny blonde and brunette ponytails, and tucking the giggling girls into bed after reading to them.\n \n\n   \n  But giggles have grown quiet as the young girls wonder what happened to their loving dad, who, in their eyes, simply vanished this summer. The girls haven’t seen him in 107 days.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on August 1, and never came home. Now, it’s unclear when his family will see him again as the father of two learned just days ago of his imminent deportation on Monday to Ukraine, a country ravaged by war, and one he hasn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union.\n \n\n   \n  His detainment stems from President Donald Trump’s determination to arrest and deport undocumented  migrants en masse  – an effort  fracturing families  across the country as  communities watch  their workers, schoolchildren and church members be swept up by ICE.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Surovtsev’s detainment.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev had never so much as skipped an event at the girls’ school before missing his oldest daughter’s fifth birthday later in August. He was still absent for his wife’s birthday a month later, then their wedding anniversary, and soon to be the holidays – Surovtsev’s favorite time of year to spend with his family.\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been telling her young daughters their dad is at work, and gave their oldest a locket with his picture inside after he was detained. She’s been wearing it more often in recent days, her mother said, asking the photo inside, “Daddy, come home.”\n \n\n   \n  “They’re too little to understand, and there’s no way to tell them without making them fearful of their own country,” Samantha said through tears. She and the girls have been living on savings as they accumulate attorney fees, and she said she feels like she’s going through life as a single mom.\n \n\n   \n  In a court filing on Wednesday, the Department of Justice confirmed it has arranged for Surovtsev to be removed to Ukraine on Monday. His attorneys say 82 other immigrants will be on Surovtsev’s flight with the same fate, and fear for their safety in wartime Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m afraid that my life will be taken in this war, and my girls are going to have to grow up without their dad, my wife is going to have to be a widow, and I myself will lose my life in a war that I know nothing about,” Surovtsev said in a video reviewed by CNN his wife recorded during one of his calls to her from detention.\n \n\n   \n    Surovtsev found love, work and God after escaping Soviet rule\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was born in the USSR city of Zhdanov – which has since been renamed Mariupol in present-day Ukraine – in 1984. After his father, a Chernobyl nuclear power plant worker, died from radiation poisoning after it  exploded , Surovtsev fled the USSR at 4 years old with his mother and two siblings.\n \n\n   \n  The family came to the US lawfully, forfeiting their USSR citizenship, and slept in a San Francisco church for six months before settling further north in Sacramento, court filings show. But poverty followed them across California.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was a young child when he began stealing small toys in an effort to hide that his family was poor, court filings show, and he was around 7 years old when he started helping his mother work by cleaning homes and law offices. What followed was a boyhood marked by struggles to get by in his adopted country.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014. Following his sentence, an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported, costing him his green card. He was placed into ICE custody but ultimately released by the US government on an order of supervision, after it determined it wasn’t likely he would be removed from the country anytime soon, and in that case, continued detention would be unlawful, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Without USSR citizenship or a green card, Surovtsev has since lived his life as a  stateless person  with a work permit, routinely checking in with ICE. He’s never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers said in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  As his family found relief from Soviet rule in the United States, Surovtsev also found love, gratifying work, and God.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Surovtsev was baptized in prison. When he came to Christ, everything changed, his wife said. He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County. The two married, bought a home in a suburb north of Dallas, started a painting business together and welcomed their two girls.\n \n\n   \n  “He created a life here, and he’s being ripped away from it,” she said. “The person he is on paper is not the person he is now. Twenty years have passed since he committed that crime and a lot of life has been lived.”\n \n\n   \n  Between juggling the family business and raising his daughters, Surovtsev was training to be part of a prison ministry where he could travel to jails offering religious services and support for detainees.\n \n\n   \n  Then, he was detained himself.\n \n\n   \n  At the Bluebonnet and Prairieland Detention Facilities in Texas he’s been held at since August, Surovtsev’s faith hasn’t wavered, his wife said. He leads a nightly Bible study with his fellow inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Since he anticipates boarding a flight to Ukraine Monday, the group held an extra session this weekend to rally around him in prayer one more time.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, the US government plans to deport 83 people to Ukraine where they will be conscripted into the army and likely killed. Ukraine is a police state where the population lives under martial law,” Surovstev’s attorneys Eric Lee and Chris Godshall-Bennett said in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Neither DHS nor the Ukrainian Embassy responded to CNN requests for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Among the detainees are individuals who have lived in the US since they were kids. Many have US citizen spouses and children,” the lawyers wrote. “Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovstev does not speak or read Ukrainian. Having fled at such a young age, Surovstev has very little memory of the former Soviet town where he was born, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  Surovstev’s birthplace, present-day Mariupol, Ukraine, has endured some of the most  devastating strikes and sieges  from Russia during the war. The city’s infrastructure and housing were  almost entirely destroyed , civilians suffer  starvation , and thousands have been killed or displaced. Despite reconstruction efforts being promoted by  Russian authorities , the city remains heavily damaged.\n \n\n   \n    Lawyers say Surovtsev is close to regaining his green card status\n \n\n   \n  The US government had run into trouble trying to deport Surovtsev before.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six weeks. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  “Often when he met with officers, he was told that ICE had made a new attempt to contact the embassy of either Ukraine, Russia or both, but that either or both governments had refused to grant him travel documents,” his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans. But on August 1, he was unexpectedly detained, and an officer refused to accept his stay of removal from his immigration counsel who accompanied him to the appointment, his lawyers write in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  But now it’s unclear what documentation Ukraine may have for Surovtsev’s deportation or what changed from a decade ago, when the country couldn’t prove his citizenship.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2014 and 2015, ICE tried and failed to deport Mr. Surovtsev to Ukraine when the Ukrainian consulate told them it couldn’t prove he was a citizen,” Lee, the attorney, said in a statement. “Now we are told Ukraine is giving ‘temporary passports’ to detainees, whatever that means. To this day Ukraine has never acknowledged Mr. Surovtsev is a citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on Surovtsev’s detainment.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s always complied, but we knew that maybe something would be different this year, just because of what was going on with this immigration crackdown,” his wife said. “We didn’t think that this would be our reality.”\n \n\n   \n  His detainment mobilized Samantha, when she said she became his “assistant full-time” as she tirelessly drafted a legal team to get him out.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys successfully vacated Surovstev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, and will have him plead to a lesser charge that doesn’t have immigration consequences.\n \n\n   \n  This change in circumstances would justify reopening his case, which his team has filed for, Surovstev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said, and Surovstev’s lawful permanent resident status would be restored if a judge agreed to dismiss it.\n \n\n   \n  All his family and legal team can do is wait for the case to be heard, but it sits in a heavy queue of similar motions. There is no expedited process at the immigration court level, Rozdzielski said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of securing post-conviction relief for a past crime, he is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active warzone,” Surovstev’s attorneys Lee and Godshall-Bennett said.\n \n\n   \n  The flight to Ukraine is poised to take off before a judge could make any new rulings. The motion was filed on November 4, and his attorney estimates a two- to three-month timeline.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family, our community and our country is not better off with him gone,” Samantha said. “Even if he’s remaining in detention, we just want time for our case to be heard. That’s all we want.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/business/now-you-see-me-weekend-box-office","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Now You See Me: Now You Don’t Makes Movie Audiences Reappear in $21 Million Domestic Opening","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The movie 'Now You See Me: Now You Don’t' opened to $21.3 million domestically, outperforming earlier installments and drawing a strong young female audience.

The first “Now You See Me” opened in 2013 to more than $29 million, according to Box Office Mojo, and “Now You See Me 2” opened to $22 million in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of analytics firm   Box Office Theory, credited some of the heist movie’s success this weekend to Lionsgate’s advertising, which included fan-like edits posted to social media.\n \n\n   \n  “Their marketing team can really be commended for bringing out a very strong young female audience,” he said, adding that the studio reported half of ticket buyers were women and a “healthy amount” were over 25 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Coming in behind “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” was Paramount Pictures’ “The Running Man” ($17 million), which was the second adaptation of a 1982 Stephen King novel. Sony Pictures released “The Running Man,” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, in 1987.\n \n\n   \n  “’Now You See Me: Now You Don’t’ and ‘The Running Man’ opening on the same weekend was perfect timing, because they’ll play into Thanksgiving,” said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. “Certainly, this was a great warm-up for what’s going to be a much-needed boost for the box office.”\n \n\n   \n  Box office analyst David A. Gross, who runs the FranchiseRe movie consulting firm, wrote that “The Running Man’s” opening was above average for a King movie. According to FranchiseRe data, the last 18 King adaptations opened to $14.6 million on average domestically.\n \n\n   \n  Third overall at the box office was Disney’s “Predator: Badlands,” which had its best franchise opening with $40 million domestically last weekend. But it earned just $13 million this weekend, a worse-than-expected drop of 68% from its opening.\n \n\n   \n  The slate of movies in theaters this weekend is ultimately the “calm before the storm,” said Robbins, when Universal Pictures debuts “Wicked: For Good,” the sequel to last year’s highly acclaimed “Wicked,” which  opened  to $114 million.\n \n\n   \n  “Wicked: For Good” could rake in upwards of $140 million to as much as $180 million, according to Gross. That’s more than the combined success of “Wicked” and “Gladiator II” during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend last year, which combined to gross $169.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  Hollywood has seen sluggish box office sales this   fall, but industry analysts expect a rebound in the coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Disney’s “Zootopia 2” opens Thanksgiving weekend, which could end a “long drought” of animated movies that didn’t perform well at the box office,   Robbins said.\n \n\n   \n  And Universal Pictures is releasing “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” a sequel to the 2023 horror film based on the video game series.\n \n\n   \n  Other movies expected to see big audiences include “Avatar: Fire and Ice” (December 19), and “Marty Supreme,” “Anaconda” and “Song Sung Blue” on December 25.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna have a supercharged final six weeks of the year,” Dergarabedian said. “After a fairly slow post-Summer period, this is where we’re going to make up a lot of ground.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/indian-americans-racism-maga-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00-05:00","title":"Racists Are Now Openly Targeting Indian Americans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A surge in racist and xenophobic attacks targeting Indian Americans and Indian immigrants has emerged across the U.S. political and social landscape, fueled by rhetoric from prominent right-wing figures including FBI Director Kash Patel, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and Vice President JD Vance.

\nUpdated: \n        6:05 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Last month, FBI Director Kash Patel wished his followers on  X  a happy Diwali. It did not go over well.\n \n\n   \n  Far-right Christian nationalist and white nationalist accounts flooded his post with bigoted memes and rhetoric. “Go back home and worship your sand demons,” a far-right pastor wrote. “Get the f**k out of my country,” read another reply. Said another, “This is America. We don’t do this.” These responses, some of which were seen millions of times, were on the tamer end of the spectrum.\n \n\n   \n  Similar hostility followed Diwali greetings on X from former UN ambassador  Nikki Haley , former presidential candidate  Vivek Ramaswamy  and Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights  Harmeet Dhillon , as well as posts about the holiday from the  White House , the  State Department , Texas Gov.  Greg Abbott  and Arkansas Gov.  Sarah Huckabee Sanders .\n \n\n   \n  Some Indian American conservatives seem shocked that segments of the political right are now taking aim at them. When Democrats won big on election night, Ramaswamy  advised  Republicans to “cut out the identity politics,” saying “we don’t care about the color of your skin or your religion. We care about the content of your character.” After one X user said that the existence of Indians disgusted them, Dinesh D’Souza, the right-wing commentator who has peddled  racism  against  Black Americans  for decades,  mused : “In a career spanning 40 years, I have never encountered this type of rhetoric. The Right never used to talk like this. So who on our side has legitimized this type of vile degradation?”\n \n\n   \n  This type of degrading rhetoric is  not   new , but it’s increasingly prominent from the  political right . With the rise of  once-fringe figures , and with President Donald Trump aggressively cracking down on  nearly   every type of immigration , some members of the MAGA coalition are openly suggesting that only white Christians belong in America.\n \n\n   \n  “The call is coming from inside the house,” said Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan, an editorial manager and analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue who has examined anti-Indian hate speech and the far right online.\n \n\n   \n  Indian immigrants and Indian Americans — or anyone perceived as Indian — are the latest target of a growing anti-migrant movement in the US and  around   the world . Over the past year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Organized Hate have documented a  surge  of  anti-Indian sentiment  on X that is showing no signs of abating. Raqib Naik, the center’s founder and executive director, said that his team recorded nearly 2,700 posts promoting racism and xenophobia against Indians and Indian Americans in October alone. At least some of that might be explained by Elon Musk’s transformation of the platform: Since he took over, racist content that would previously have been policed by content moderators is now amplified and encouraged. (X did not respond to a request for comment.)\n \n\n   \n  As with the Diwali outrage, these attitudes flare up at times when India or Indians are in the news: Trump’s appointment of  Sriram Krishnan  as senior adviser on artificial intelligence, Ramaswamy criticizing American culture as mediocre in a  social media post , escalations in the  US-India trade war  and a  fatal accident  in Florida involving a Sikh truck driver.\n \n\n   \n  But the most consistent anti-Indian bigotry online focuses on the H-1B visa program, of which Indian nationals are the  biggest beneficiaries , Naik and other researchers said. The program, which admits highly skilled foreigners into the US to work in specialized fields, has sparked  infighting among Trump supporters , with visa opponents such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller  accusing  India of “a lot of cheating on immigration policies.” While the president’s stance on the issue has fluctuated, he recently restricted access to H-1B visas by imposing a  $100,000 application fee .\n \n\n   \n  Far-right accounts and actors now routinely frame Indian immigrants as scammers who are depriving Americans of high-paying jobs and call to deport them. They accuse Indians of hiring only within their caste or ethnicity, invoke stereotypes about Indians being dirty or smelly, and highlight behaviors like eating with one’s hands as cultural backwardness. It isn’t just far-right trolls who invoke these tropes — during the recent New York City mayoral race, the independent campaign of former Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo released (then quickly deleted) an  AI-generated attack ad  depicting Zohran Mamdani sloppily eating rice with his hands.\n \n\n   \n   Slurs directed at South Asians,  some of which originated on the largely unmoderated online forum 4chan, are  surging  and entering the lexicon, both online and offline. Photos and videos selectively showing Indian-origin people in public places are held up as evidence of an “invasion,” another iteration of white “ replacement theory .” These attitudes didn’t emerge in a vacuum. Even before Trump was first elected, powerful figures in his movement including Steve Bannon and Miller were referencing the 1970s novel “ The Camp of the Saints ” as a cautionary tale — in the book, a favorite of white supremacists, a fleet of Indian migrants led by a feces-eating farmer invades France and overthrows the Western world.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop of racist and  economic grievance , the success and prominence of Indian Americans make them an easy target, said Rohit Chopra, a professor at Santa Clara University who studies far-right online communities and who co-authored the reports for the Center for the Study of Organized Hate with Naik. Indian immigrants and Indian Americans are among the  highest-earning  ethnic groups in the US, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of census data. They’ve ascended to top government posts and are CEOs of billion-dollar companies. They’re represented at the highest levels of media, entertainment, technology, business, medicine and academia.\n \n\n   \n  “The public image of the Indian community has been that of these basically successful tech professionals and CEOs,” Chopra said. “And the Indian community and Indian American community significantly plays up that image too.”\n \n\n   \n  This image certainly doesn’t reflect all Indian Americans, a religiously and ethnically diverse group that includes US citizens, legally authorized visa workers, international students and undocumented migrants. But as long-simmering resentment against affluent Indian Americans metastasizes into a demonization of the entire community, Chopra said there’s a danger that this could inspire real-world violence.\n \n\n   \n    Indian Americans are feeling the hostility offline\n \n\n   \n  Already, anti-Indian attitudes online are spilling over into everyday life.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, a city councilmember in  Palm Bay, Florida,  repeatedly denigrated Indians and called for their mass deportation on social media, leading to censure and calls for his removal. In Irving, Texas, a Dallas suburb home to thousands of Indian tech professionals, three masked men staged a  roadside protest  carrying signs that read “Don’t India My Texas,” “Deport H-1B Visa Scammers” and “Reject Foreign Demons.”\n \n\n   \n  Stephanie Chan, Stop AAPI Hate’s director of data and research, recounted a recent conversation with a South Asian community leader in Texas who told her white supremacist groups were harassing people outside Hindu temples. Stop AAPI Hate co-founder Manjusha Kulkarni said she overheard people at a Diwali party talking about readying their OCI cards — which allow foreign citizens of Indian origin to live and work in India indefinitely — just in case.\n \n\n   \n  Racist incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate this year and shared with CNN also suggest that anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump and parts of his coalition is inspiring hostility. One woman in Georgia shared that a fellow customer at a fast food restaurant threatened to call ICE to get her deported back to India. Another woman in Texas reported that a man who came into her workplace yelled profanities at her and a coworker, saying “I am glad Trump is deporting you b*tches. I hope you have a green card.”\n \n\n   \n  Salil Maniktahla, an Indian American who lives in Springfield, Virginia, said he was similarly accosted while dining at a restaurant with a friend earlier this year. A man hurled slurs at him, said Trump was president and told him to “go home” and “do Bharatanatyam,” referring to a South Indian classical dance. The man also threatened them with violence and waited for them outside, resulting in Maniktahla’s friend calling the police.\n \n\n   \n  “What I see now is that a lot of people are mouthing off in ways that they felt they were prevented from doing prior to 2016,” Maniktahla said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about backlash to officials’ Diwali posts online, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “The President is a fierce defender of religious liberty and cherishes his deep and longstanding relationship with this patriotic community.” As racist, nativist and anti-immigrant rhetoric continues to proliferate on the right, Trump and Vice President JD Vance have done little to quell it.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, whose wife Usha Vance is Indian American,  dismissed  remarks from a government staffer such as “normalize Indian hate” as  youthful indiscretion .\n \n\n   \n  Vance has also furthered ideas underlying such bigotry, though with more delicate language. In a  speech  at the Claremont Institute in July, he ruminated on what it meant to be an American. Merely embracing the nation’s foundational principles was not enough, he said, because it would potentially open the country to millions of foreigners and exclude some on the right who reject those same ideals. A better criterion might be  one’s heritage , he added: “I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong.”\n \n\n   \n  In the speech, Vance conceded that there was room in the US for some immigrants, so long as they demonstrated sufficient gratitude. Too many, though, would threaten the fabric of the nation, he argued. “And what we’re doing is recognizing that if you stop importing millions of foreigners into the country, you allow that social cohesion to form naturally,” he said. “It’s hard to become neighbors with your fellow citizens when your own government keeps on importing new neighbors every single year at a record number.”\n \n\n   \n  At this year’s White House Diwali celebration, Kash Patel used a conspicuous turn of phrase — one seemingly meant to distinguish himself from another kind of immigrant.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an honor to be a first-generation Indian American whose parents lawfully immigrated to this country,”  he said .\n \n\n   \n  To some Trump supporters responding online to his remarks, it didn’t seem to matter that Patel’s parents entered the US legally or that he was a dutiful member of the Trump administration. “Go celebrate your foreign gods back home in India. America is a Christian nation,” one user wrote. Said another, “Hard to think of something less American. This is an abomination.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that sections of the Indian American community have been living in this fool’s paradise,” Chopra said.\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “This should serve as a kind of wake-up call — that racism that’s directed at people of color and minority groups, you are not exempt from. And maybe that should spark some kind of reflection about questions of solidarity with other vulnerable groups.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/venezuela-trump-military-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:13:00-05:00","title":"Trump Suggests Decision on Venezuela Military Operations After High-Level Briefings and U.S. Buildup","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has indicated he has made a decision on potential military operations in Venezuela following high-level briefings with top U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:13 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump suggested he has made up his mind on a course of action in Venezuela following multiple  high-level briefings  last week and a mounting US  show of force  in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Officials briefed Trump last week on options for military operations inside Venezuela, four sources told CNN, as he weighs the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign to potentially  oust President Nicolás Maduro . The US military, meanwhile, has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded “Operation Southern Spear.”\n \n\n   \n  The president indicated Friday he was drawing closer to a path forward on his attempts to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — and the possibility of regime change.\n \n\n   \n  “I sort of have made up my mind — yeah. I mean, I can’t tell you what it would be, but I sort of have,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked directly about those meetings and whether he had made a decision.\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump been briefed on?\n \n\n   \n  A small group, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, briefed the president on Wednesday. A larger national security team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top officials, met with Trump in the Situation Room on Thursday, according to a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team reviewed target options during both meetings.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including air strikes on military or government facilities and drug-trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine production facilities and drug-trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action. Trump said last month he had  authorized the CIA  to operate in the country, but administration officials  told lawmakers this month  that the US didn’t have a legal justification that would support attacks against any land targets — though it is possible they could generate one. Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  The president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n    What assets are in the region?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,   the US has amassed its naval forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration has launched  at least 20 strikes  on alleged drug-trafficking boats, an effort officials say is meant to disrupt the flow of drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the region last week and entered the Caribbean Sea on Sunday, the Navy announced.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself — described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform” — the US has amassed roughly 15,000 military personnel in the region, alongside more than a dozen warships, including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship, amphibious assault vessels, and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that the US military “would be ready, if asked” to take action in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “The president and secretary of war have spent a lot of time thinking about what is the best thing they can do for the American people. And I can speak from the Army’s perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world,” Driscoll said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts describe the level of military buildup as significant.\n \n\n   \n  “I have been surprised by both the scale and the speed, and it is unprecedented,” Eric Farnsworth, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN. “It’s the most significant build up this century. In fact, you have to go back to 1989, the US invasion of Panama, for anything remotely similar.”\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela, in turn, has said  it is launching  a “massive mobilization” of military personnel, weapons and equipment.\n \n\n   \n    Potential risks and rewards\n \n\n   \n  Regime change in Venezuela would require serious commitment by the US and carries high risk, but ousting Maduro could give Trump and his team credit for something that has proved elusive to multiple US administrations, including his own.\n \n\n   \n  During  his first term in office , Trump officially recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader, but a failed coup attempt in 2019 meant Guaidó never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump ousted Maduro, the US president could claim major wins: getting a strongman out and an elected leader in, the possibility of enhanced collaboration on flows of drugs and migration, and potential deals on oil.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have also warned that if Trump ordered strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, the US president could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency.\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Caracas on Friday, Maduro warned that US military intervention could lay the groundwork for what he described as “another Gaza,” a “new Afghanistan” or “Vietnam again.”\n \n\n   \n  Offering a direct message to the US, he said, “Stop the insane hand of those who order bombing, killing and bringing war to South America, to the Caribbean. Stop the war. No to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Extended US military involvement also runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars. Both Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth served in the military during the Iraq War and have since expressed skepticism about entangling the US in foreign conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/science/meteor-shower-leonids-november","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"The Leonid meteor shower is peaking early this week.

Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Gina Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sky-gazers worldwide may get the chance to see a celestial display this week as the annual Leonid meteor shower reaches its peak.\n \n\n   \n  The Leonids are set to peak at 1 p.m. ET Monday, according to  EarthSky . You may start glimpsing meteors at 11 p.m. Sunday local time, which is when the constellation Leo rises over the horizon. But it’s best to watch for them between 4 a.m. Monday and sunrise local time, said Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike a lot of (meteor) showers, the Leonids have a very sharp peak,” Lunsford said, adding there is only one good night for viewing.\n \n\n   \n  The Leonids’ parent comet,  55P/Tempel-Tuttle , is to thank for this  brief duration. The size of the comet’s debris trail is small, so Earth passes through it for a short amount of time.\n \n\n   \n  The meteors you’ll see around 11 p.m. Sunday will be Earth grazers, Lunsford said, which means they’ll last longer than normal and will shoot across a large portion of the sky. “But you won’t see as many because a lot of the Leonid activity will be shooting downward below the horizon,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Under clear weather conditions, you can expect to see 10 to 15 meteors per hour.\n \n\n   \n    Showers and storms\n \n\n   \n  While a meteor shower is expected this year, the Leonids are known for occasionally producing tremendous meteor storms, with at least 1,000 meteors per hour.\n \n\n   \n  The last  Leonid meteor storm  was in 2002. However, one of the most memorable storms occurred in 1966 when “we passed right through the center of one of the Leonid streams and rates were estimated at 40 meteors per second,” Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n  That storm had meteor activity so prevalent in the sky that meteors appeared to fall like rain.\n \n\n   \n  High meteor activity coincides with when the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle reaches perihelion — its closest approach in orbit to the sun. It takes the comet 33 years to orbit the sun, so the larger Leonid meteor showers — and sometimes storms — tend to occur about every 33 years.\n \n\n   \n  For a storm to happen, Earth has to pass through a dense part of the comet’s debris during perihelion, but sometimes our planet only skims the outskirts.\n \n\n   \n  The next shower that will coincide with the comet’s orbital cycle will take place in 2033, but it is not expected to be a storm, Lunsford said. “We may see rates of around 100 an hour, which is comparable to the Geminids,” he said, “but we certainly don’t expect any storms which are 1,000 meters an hour.”\n \n\n   \n    Upcoming meteor showers\n \n\n   \n  Here are the peak dates of the two remaining meteor showers anticipated this year, according to the  American Meteor Society  and  EarthSky. \n \n\n   \n    Upcoming supermoon\n \n\n   \n  Look out for  the last full supermoon  this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/new-orleans-clerk-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00.000Z","title":"A New Orleans man who had his murder conviction tossed wins election as city’s chief record keeper","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Calvin Duncan, a New Orleans man wrongfully convicted of a 1981 murder, won election in November 2025 as the city’s chief criminal court record keeper after his conviction was vacated in 2021.

Billy Stockwell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:36 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran’s deputy foreign minister Saeed Khatibzadeh has described his country’s  nuclear program  as still “intact” despite admitting that US and Israeli strikes badly damaged facilities earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen Sunday, Khatibzadeh said Iran’s “peaceful nuclear program is intact, as we are speaking,” adding that “we are going to be protecting that.”\n \n\n   \n  The exact state of Iran’s facilities remains unclear following a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June and  US airstrikes  against three of the country’s nuclear facilities – Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan – also that month.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump initially claimed that Fordow had been obliterated. An  early US intelligence assessment  suggested the three nuclear facilities had been badly damaged, but that Iran’s nuclear program may have only been set back by up to two years.\n \n\n   \n  While Khatibzadeh said that Israeli and US strikes had “ruined many of our infrastructure, machineries” and “buildings,” he noted that the nuclear program was “very much based on our indigenous knowledge, very much spread across our country, which is a huge country – 90 million people.”\n \n\n   \n  “And this country is not a country that you can bomb and then think that you are going to ruin everything,” the minister said.\n \n\n   \n  Khatibzadeh’s assessment comes as Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, said Sunday that no uranium enrichment was taking place “right now” because the country’s enrichment facilities had been “attacked.” The enrichment process produces fuel for nuclear power plants, which, at higher-enrichment levels, can also be used to make a nuclear bomb.\n \n\n   \n  Khatibzadeh did not comment on whether enrichment was taking place at Iran’s facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a confidential report Wednesday that checking Iran’s stock of highly enriched uranium was “long overdue,” with its inspectors still not allowed into the bombed nuclear sites, Reuters has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Khatibzadeh said Iran’s nuclear program was peaceful, repeating Tehran’s long-standing position that it exists solely for energy generation purposes.\n \n\n   \n  He also suggested that any future dialogue with the United States over Iran’s nuclear program would be contingent on an agreement that Iran could pursue uranium enrichment. “Delusions of zero enrichment inside Iran or trying to deprive Iran from its basic rights is not going to be an option for Iran,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Khatibzadeh said Iran has “legitimate military programs to defend our national interests and our national security.” Asked by CNN if Tehran is expanding its missile program, the minister said the program was going through “repair and recovery” after a US-brokered  ceasefire  between Israel and Iran came into effect in June.\n \n\n   \n  Last month,  CNN reported  on signs that Iran is stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the recent reintroduction of United Nations sanctions that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources said Chinese firms were helping Iran rebuild its ballistic missile program, with several shipments of sodium perchlorate – a missile propellant precursor – being delivered from China to Iran since the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  In his CNN interview, Khatibzadeh said Iran has “very close relations” with China, as well as Russia, which predate “anything that happened recently.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he had a message to the Trump administration regarding its relationship with Iran, the deputy minister said his country is the “oldest living, continuous civilization on earth… This country and this nation is (a) master of survival.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Melissa Bell and Gianluca Mezzofiore contributed to this report.

rules in years, setting Europe’s longest route to settlement \n       \n  By Laura Sharman, Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:17 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Britain  plans to carry out the most significant reform of its asylum policy in modern times by making refugee status temporary and quadrupling the wait for permanent settlement to 20 years, as the  Labour government  confronts a “broken” asylum system that has fueled support for right-wing parties.\n \n\n   \n  After a summer of protests outside  hotels  housing asylum seekers, a mass anti-immigration demonstration in  London , and constant criticism from the surging hard-right  Reform UK party , the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, announced plans to curb illegal small-boat crossings from France and return refugees to their home countries when it is safe to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a system that is out of control,” Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s unfair, and it’s putting huge pressure on communities. It is important that we restore order and control to this system, so that we can retain public permission and public confidence in having an asylum system at all.”\n \n\n   \n  The government’s plan, which will be unveiled in full on Monday, has two main prongs. First, ending the “automatic path” to settled status after a refugee has been in Britain for five years. Under the changes, a refugee’s status will now be reviewed every two-and-a-half years during a 20-year wait before they can apply for permanent settlement.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said this measure will upend the “generations-old assumption” that sanctuary provided to refugees can quickly lead to settled status “and all of the rights that go alongside that.”\n \n\n   \n  “If your country becomes safe in the intervening period… you will be returned to your country,” Mahmood stressed. Those who arrive legally will also face a 10-year pathway to permanent settlement, double the current wait.\n \n\n   \n  Second, housing and weekly allowances will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to. Those who break the law will also have their support withdrawn. Mahmood said: “It is not fair if British citizens and long-term residents in this country have to follow one set of rules and comply, and another group of people – who also have the right to work – get away with not complying.”\n \n\n   \n  The new policy takes inspiration from Denmark’s approach, one of the toughest in Europe. But Britain is now poised to go further: The new 20-year route would make Britain’s path to settlement the longest in Europe, followed by Denmark’s eight-year process.\n \n\n   \n  Since winning a landslide election in 2024, Labour has tried to tread a line between showing competence in tackling illegal immigration, without alienating its more progressive voter base which favors a more compassionate approach.\n \n\n   \n   Both sides have been left alienated:  Right-wing voters support the more drastic measures proposed by Nigel Farage, the firebrand leader of Reform UK, while many on the left have been alarmed by Labour’s tough talk.\n \n\n   \n  But Mahmood, herself the daughter of immigrants from the Pakistani side of Kashmir, said she rejected “the idea that dealing with this problem is somehow engaging with far-right talking points.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart. It is dividing communities. People can see huge pressure in their communities and they can also see a system that is broken, and where people are able to flout the rules, abuse the system, and get away with it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The Home Secretary also criticized the previous Conservative government for wasting time and public funds in its failed efforts to tackle illegal immigration. The Conservatives passed a contentious bill allowing the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be processed by the East African nation, but Mahmood said this cost £700 million ($920) and saw only four people deported – all volunteers.\n \n\n   \n  In a measure of the hardening of Britain’s debate around immigration, other mainstream parties did not forcefully criticize Labour’s plans. Chris Philp, who used to be a Conservative home office minister, told the BBC his party would support the new measures if they are “sensible,” while claiming the measures aren’t “radical” enough.\n \n\n   \n  Ed Davey, leader of the more progressive Liberal Democrats, also said Labour is right to announce asylum measures to “tackle the chaos.”\n \n\n   \n    The Denmark model\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s new policy draws inspiration from Denmark and other European countries where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration is expected.\n \n\n   \n  In a video on X, Mahmood said she was taking action because asylum claims are rising in Britain despite falling across other parts of Europe. “In the last four years, 400,000 people claimed asylum here,” she said. “Over 100,000 are housed and supported at taxpayers’ expense, putting huge pressure on local communities.”\n \n\n   \n  The Home Office says that Denmark’s policies have reduced asylum claims there to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of rejected applicants. Earlier this year, a UK delegation of senior Home Office officials visited the capital of Copenhagen to study Denmark’s approach to asylum, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  However, its reforms have  drawn significant criticism , with rights groups saying the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Refugee Council criticized the government’s new policy announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “People who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars are not ‘asylum shopping’… refugees don’t compare asylum systems before running for their lives,” the group wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  “We know why people come to the UK: because they already have family here, they speak some English, or they have long-standing ties that help them rebuild their lives in safety,” the group added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/tech/internet-archive-wayback-machine","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:47:00-05:00","title":"Inside the old church where one trillion webpages are being saved","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Internet Archive, a non-profit digital library based in San Francisco, has preserved over one trillion webpages since its founding in 1996, serving as a critical repository for online history.

trillion webpages are being saved \n       \n  By Hadas Gold, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:47 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Just blocks from the Presidio of San Francisco, the national park at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, stands a gleaming white building, its façade adorned with eight striking gothic columns.\n \n\n   \n  But what was once the home of a Christian Scientist church, is now the holy grail of Internet history — the Internet Archive, a non-profit library run by a group of software engineers and librarians, who for nearly 30 years have been saving the web one page at a time.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the stained-glass-adorned sanctuary, the sounds of church sermons have been replaced by the hum of servers, where the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine preserves web pages.\n \n\n   \n  The Wayback Machine, a tool used by millions every day, has proven critical for academics and journalists searching for historical information on what corporations, people and governments have published online in the past, long after their websites have been updated or changed.\n \n\n   \n  For many, the Wayback Machine is like a living history of the internet, and it just logged its trillionth page last month.\n \n\n   \n  Archiving the web is more important and more challenging than ever before. The White House in January ordered vast amounts of  government webpages to be taken down . Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is blurring the line between what’s real and what’s artificially generated — in some ways replacing the need to visit websites entirely. And more of the internet is now hidden behind paywalls or tucked in conversations with AI chatbots.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the Internet Archive’s job to figure out how to preserve it all.\n \n\n   \n  “We are here to try to provide a record of what happened, so that people can learn and build on that to build a better future, or to build new ideas that are worthy of being in the (Internet Archive’s) library,” said Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle.\n \n\n   \n    The internet’s library\n \n\n   \n  Kahle created the archive in 1996 when a year’s worth of saved pages could fit on about 2 terabytes worth of hard drives, the amount of storage you can get today in an iPhone. Now, the archive is saving closer to 150 terabytes, or hundreds of millions worth of web pages, per day.\n \n\n   \n  Kahle is the driving force and personality behind the archive, with the exuberance and energy of your favorite science teacher and like an evangelist whose religion is libraries and technology. Sitting for an interview on the original wooden pews of the church, Kahle said he was inspired to purchase the building because it resembles the group’s logo. But more importantly, he said it’s a symbol of permanence and a reference to the Library of Alexandria in Egypt.\n \n\n   \n  “That was the first time somebody tried to go and collect everything ever written by humans,” Kahle said. “Of course, now that place is the internet, and the Internet Archive serves the whole internet as a library.”\n \n\n   \n  The Wayback Machine tool does more than just screenshot the page. It also saves the technical architecture — the HTML, CSS, JavaScript codes and more — so that it can attempt to “replay the page as it existed” even if the server is no longer functioning, said Wayback Machine Director Mark Graham.\n \n\n   \n  The rise of artificial intelligence and AI chatbots means the Internet Archive is changing how it records the history of the internet. In addition to web pages, the Internet Archive now captures AI-generated content, like ChatGPT answers and those summaries that appear at the top of Google search results.\n \n\n   \n  The Internet Archive team, which is made up of librarians and software engineers, are experimenting with ways to preserve how people get their news from chatbots by coming up with hundreds of questions and prompts each day based on the news, and recording both the queries and outputs, Graham said.\n \n\n   \n  The group keeps copies of its archive in locations around the world in the event of a fire or flood that could damage its servers. But there are political considerations behind this approach, as well. The Trump administration has exerted pressure over content it disagrees with by filing  lawsuits against media companies  or by way of  the Federal Communications Commission.  \n \n\n   \n  “Libraries are always targeted. The new guys often don’t like the old stuff around. So let’s design for it,” Kahle said. “Let’s go and live up to the moment and make it so that there’s different points of view stored and made permanently accessible in different environments.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration implemented  a massive overhaul of government websites  that included taking down countless pages on everything from  health policies  to the achievements of minority members of the military. It was the archive, which has been saving webpages during the transition of presidential administration websites since 2004, which enabled journalists to understand what had been altered.\n \n\n   \n  “This change was huge. Whole sections of the web came down,” Kahle said. “(The administration) has a new point of view, and that’s why we have libraries to go and have the record.”\n \n\n   \n    The people preserving the web\n \n\n   \n  Most of the archive’s servers live in a large warehouse outside of San Francisco, although a set of servers have been symbolically placed in the main sanctuary of the former church. That placement is intentional, said Kahle. By displaying the servers, he hopes “that people understand that we’re all part of the collective protection for our knowledge.”\n \n\n   \n  The headquarters is an homage to the work of the Internet Archive’s 200 staff members, which include engineers, librarians and archivists.\n \n\n   \n  Archivists use bespoke machines to digitize books page by page,   livestreaming  their work on YouTube for all to see (alongside some lo-fi music). Record players churn out vintage tunes from 1920s and 1940s, and the building houses every type of media console for any type of content imaginable, from microfilm, to CDs and satellite television. (The Internet Archive preserves music, television, books and video games, too).\n \n\n   \n  The former church’s main sanctuary also boasts more than 100 three-foot statues of employees who have been on staff for at least three years – a reference to the famous Chinese terracotta army from thousands of years ago.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways, the space captures the quirkiness -— and community — of the internet itself.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of people that are just passionate about the cause. There’s a cyberpunk atmosphere,” Annie Rauwerda, a Wikipedia editor and social media influencer, said at a party thrown at the Internet Archive’s headquarters to celebrate reaching a trillion pages   “The internet (feels) quite corporate when I use it a lot these days, but you wouldn’t know from the people here.”\n \n\n   \n  The headquarters might feel something like a living history exhibit. But the Internet Archive’s goal, says Kahle, is to preserve the web so that it can continue to have a future, not to be the arbiters of truth.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a presentation. It’s not a museum that has a story,” he said. “It’s trying to be a resource to make it so that other people can come up with their own ideas.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/science/star-giant-explosion-cme","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:38:00-05:00","title":"First Detection of a Coronal Mass Ejection from a Star Beyond Our Solar System","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Astronomers have made the first definitive detection of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from a star beyond our solar system — originating from the red dwarf star StKM 1-1262, located 130 light-years away.

This star’s explosion could destroy a planet’s atmosphere \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:38 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the first time, astronomers say they have spotted a giant explosion released by a star beyond our solar system. The eruption was similar in some ways to those unleashed by our sun, such as the solar storms that graced the night skies  with auroras  last week on Earth, but at a much grander — and ominous — scale.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than triggering colorful northern lights, this powerful explosion was more likely to have potentially devastating consequences for any nearby planet, according to new research.\n \n\n   \n  A coronal mass ejection, or a CME, was the likely cause of the explosive event. In our solar system, this phenomenon is a large cloud of ionized gas, called plasma, and magnetic fields that erupts from the sun’s outer atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  When such outbursts are large enough to reach Earth, they can cause space weather, or major disturbances of our planet’s magnetic field. These powerful solar storms create auroras at Earth’s poles but can also disrupt communications, the power grid and satellite operations.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers have never been able to detect a coronal mass ejection releasing from another star — until now. Researchers described the groundbreaking finding in a study published Wednesday in the  journal Nature .\n \n\n   \n  The star, named StKM 1-1262, is a red dwarf star about 130 light-years from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  The stellar storm launched at a blazing 5.3 million miles per hour (2,400 kilometers per second). Such speed has only been clocked in about 1 in every 2,000 coronal mass ejections released from our sun, according to the study authors.\n \n\n   \n  “The star behaves like an extremely magnetized, boiling bucket of plasma. This burst is 10 to 100 thousand times more powerful than the strongest the sun can produce,” study coauthor Cyril Tasse, research associate at the Paris Observatory, said via email. “This opens a window of extrasolar space weather.”\n \n\n   \n  The dense, rapid burst of material hurled from the star was powerful enough that it could strip away the atmosphere of a closely orbiting planet.\n \n\n   \n  Understanding how the violent activity of stars affects exoplanets is crucial as astronomers seek to determine whether any planet beyond our solar system is potentially habitable for life.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking stellar explosions\n \n\n   \n  Once released into space by a star, coronal mass ejections create a burst of radio waves while passing through the outer stellar atmosphere, called the corona.\n \n\n   \n  “They are strong gusts of stellar wind that move faster than the speed of sound in the surrounding interplanetary space, creating a shock wave that is comparable to the sonic boom of a fighter jet,” said Mark Miesch, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Miesch did not participate in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers spotted the radio signal while using new analytic software to sift through a survey of the sky that was conducted by the Low Frequency Array radio telescope, or LOFAR, nearly 10 years ago. LOFAR is composed of thousands of antennae in the Netherlands and across Europe to create one large radio telescope.\n \n\n   \n  “This kind of radio signal just wouldn’t exist unless material had completely left the star’s bubble of powerful magnetism,” said lead study author Dr. Joe Callingham, associate professor at the University of Amsterdam’s Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy. “In other words, it’s caused by a CME.”\n \n\n   \n  Tasse and study coauthor Philippe Zarka, a senior researcher at the Paris Observatory, developed the new analysis technique, called Radio Interferometric Multiplexed Spectroscopy, or RIMS. It was based on wavelengths of light captured from thousands of stars to monitor them and determine how they changed over time, Tasse said.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea was to try to detect radio signals from stars and exoplanets,” Tasse said. “This is an ideal technique for CMEs that evolve on timescales of minutes so you need continuous, high-time-resolution monitoring.”\n \n\n   \n  The signal detected by RIMS was a type II radio burst, suggesting hot gas was sweeping away from the star into space. Unlike  fast radio bursts , which are millisecond-long flashes of light with dubious origins, a type II radio burst occurs over minutes, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  “The sweep encodes the density of material as the CME travels outwards,” Callingham said. “So not only from the radio burst can we tell mass has been lost from the star, we can also determine physical parameters like density.”\n \n\n   \n  The team used data from the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton mission, launched in 1999, to measure the star’s temperature, rotation and brightness through X-rays.\n \n\n   \n  “We needed the sensitivity and frequency of LOFAR to detect the radio waves,” said study coauthor David Konijn, a doctoral student at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, in a statement. “And without XMM-Newton, we wouldn’t have been able to determine the CME’s motion or put it in a solar context, both crucial for proving what we’d found. Neither telescope alone would have been enough — we needed both.”\n \n\n   \n  Spotting coronal mass ejections releasing from other stars has proven difficult because they’re just too far away to observe the phenomenon directly, Callingham said. While previous hints of coronal mass ejections from other stars have surfaced, they could often be explained by other activity such as strong flares, and there were no definitive detections, Tasse added.\n \n\n   \n  “Previous evidence for CMEs in other stars has mainly been concerned with the early stages of the event, when the plasma first lifts off from the star,” Miesch said.\n \n\n   \n  But using a sensitive telescope like LOFAR and searching for the telltale radio signal enabled a direct discovery, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  Miesch said the emission signature matches the known signatures of type II radio bursts from solar CMEs.\n \n\n   \n  The clear detection of a type II stellar radio burst has long been sought after as an indicator of coronal mass ejections from other stars, said Kevin France, associate professor and astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder. France has studied coronal mass ejections but did not participate in this research.\n \n\n   \n  “This detection provides what is likely the strongest evidence yet that this phenomenon occurs beyond the solar system,” he wrote in an email. “This observation, and hopefully more like it, will allow us to better understand the violent early lives of these low mass stars that make up over 70% of all the stars in our Milky Way.”\n \n\n   \n    The search for life\n \n\n   \n  Red dwarf stars can have magnetic fields that are more than 1,000 times stronger than that of our sun, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  StKM 1-1262 has half the mass of our star, but it rotates 20 times faster and boasts a magnetic field that is estimated to be 300 times more powerful, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists often find exoplanets orbiting these stars that are much fainter, cooler and smaller than our sun, and at a closer distance than planets in our solar system — sometimes completing one orbit in a matter of days.\n \n\n   \n  Because red dwarf stars are less luminous and cooler than our star, the habitable zone — the distance from a star where conditions on the planet are warm enough to potentially support liquid water on its surface — is much smaller, meaning planets are more tightly clustered around the diminutive stars.\n \n\n   \n  But astronomers have long questioned whether flares released from red dwarf stars could lash planets with harmful radiation. If a planet does have liquid water on its surface, which means it could potentially be habitable for life, then it also has a protective atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  Currently, it isn’t known whether any planets orbit StKM 1-1262, but based on previous research, almost every red dwarf star seems to host at least one planet, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  “The protective magnetic field we have on Earth would not be able to withstand the pressure of the CME, exposing its atmosphere directly to CME (causing it to be stripped),” Callingham wrote in an email. “So even if the planet is in the perfect region around the star, its atmosphere would be lost quickly, leaving a barren rock behind (kind of like Mars).”\n \n\n   \n  Next, the researchers want to try and determine how such small stars build and release such enormous energy, Tasse said — and figure out what impact repeated coronal mass ejections could have on nearby planets.\n \n\n   \n  Callingham is also the head of the Square Kilometre Array Science Group at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.\n \n\n   \n  The Square Kilometre Array, expected to be completed in 2028, will include thousands of dishes and up to 1 million low-frequency antennae to create the world’s largest radio telescope, which could search for coronal mass ejections releasing from other stars.\n \n\n   \n  “This is only the beginning, and hopefully a taste of what’s to come,” Miesch said. “Hopefully this will inspire follow-up studies to verify this is what we think it is and to further characterize how frequent such events are.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-accountability-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:14:00-05:00","title":"The war in Gaza is over, but the fight in Israel for accountability has barely begun","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the end of the Gaza war, Israel is facing a deep domestic reckoning over accountability for the October 7 attacks, which killed over 1,200 Israelis.

the fight in Israel for accountability has barely begun \n       \n  By Tal Shalev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:14 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “Do you really think, Mr. Netanyahu, that you can rename wars, hand out medals, tell tales of your heroism  –  and still avoid investigating the greatest national failure in Israel’s history?”\n \n\n   \n  Eyal Eshel’s voice cracked with rage as he stood on stage in Tel Aviv Saturday night and read aloud to thousands of protestors the cabinet’s recent decision to rename the  Gaza war  from “Operation Swords of Iron” to the “War of Redemption.” Then he tore it to shreds.\n \n\n   \n  “Forget it,” Eshel, whose daughter Roni was killed as an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) observer at Nahal Oz on October 7, continued. “We, the bereaved families, the residents of the Gaza envelope, the citizens of Israel  –  we will not let you. Until you investigate, there will be no revival. My Roni will not return, but the truth still can.”\n \n\n   \n  The scene captured one of the central battles now unfolding in Israel. The long war in Gaza has drawn to a close, but the domestic confrontation over accountability has barely begun.\n \n\n   \n  More than two years after the  deadliest day in Israel’s history , the government has yet to establish an official state commission of inquiry to investigate the security and intelligence failures that enabled Hamas to kill over 1,200 Israelis and kidnap more than 250 others.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, on Sunday, the government decided to move forward with establishing an “independent” commission of inquiry into the events of October 7, which will have “full investigative powers, and its composition will reflect the broadest possible public consensus.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the decision, Netanyahu will appoint a ministerial committee to present within 45 days its recommendation on the commission’s mandate. Instead of a state commission of inquiry, it’s a further delay.\n \n\n   \n  After the decision, the October Council - a coalition of bereaved families and survivors - condemned what it called the “political commission” and announced further demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  During the war,  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  repeatedly argued that an inquiry must wait until the fighting ended. Now that it is, bereaved families, survivors, and residents from the devastated Gaza border communities are intensifying their demand for a state commission of inquiry that will give them answers.\n \n\n   \n  A state commission of inquiry is the most powerful mechanism in Israeli law  –  empowered to investigate national-level disasters and decisions independent from the government of the day.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu, is pushing an alternative mechanism that would allow him to maintain control over who investigates and who bears responsibility, which critics say is designed to protect him rather than uncover the truth.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s rally was the first time the October Council   organized a mass protest, in an attempt to mobilize public support.\n \n\n   \n  “On October 7, more than 1,200 men, women and children were murdered or fell in battle. Babies were slaughtered in their cribs. Entire families were wiped out before our eyes. This was not just an attack – it was a small Holocaust in the heart of the State of Israel,” Rafi Ben Shitrit, whose son Elroi was killed in battle at the Nahal Oz post told the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of this pain  –  from the ashes  –  we must demand the one thing that should have been obvious,” he continued. “A full, independent state commission of inquiry to examine every process, every failure, every act of neglect, every silence. Without uncovering the full truth, there can be no repair.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet Netanyahu has adamantly resisted calls for such a commission because its members would be appointed by the Chief Justice of Israel’s Supreme Court, an institution his government has spent the past three years undermining.\n \n\n   \n  He has transformed his government’s clash with Israel’s judiciary, which predates the Gaza war, into a shield against calls for accountability, arguing there is low public trust in a state inquiry commission because it falls under the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Netanyahu reiterated in the Knesset that any future commission will not be, under any circumstances, a state commission of inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  During a debate initiated by 40 opposition parliamentarians, he claimed that “a large part of the public has no faith in a state commission of inquiry. We will promote a committee that represents all parts of the nation. The opposition shouts ‘state commission,’ yet they know that half of Israel would not accept its composition or conclusions. We seek a balanced committee that will investigate everyone and enjoy broad public trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Members of the October Council attending the session turned their backs in protest.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Netanyahu’s repeated claims that most Israelis oppose a state commission  –  and his campaign against it  –  repeated opinion surveys suggest the opposite. A poll by the Institute for National Security Studies in late October found that nearly three-quarters of Israelis (74%) support establishing a state commission, compared to just 17% who oppose it. Even among coalition voters, a majority (52%) back the move, while support among opposition voters reaches 92%.\n \n\n   \n  But public opinion hasn’t nudged Netanyahu’s government. Under pressure from petitions by bereaved families to the High Court, the cabinet has held repeated debates on the matter  –  but stopped short of any commitment. A discussion scheduled for Sunday is unlikely to break that pattern.\n \n\n   \n  Since the war ended, however, Netanyahu has stepped up efforts to establish a more limited alternative.\n \n\n   \n  One model is a government committee whose members he could appoint; another is a parliamentary committee divided equally between coalition and opposition representatives which would likely lead quickly to deadlock and paralysis. Neither would enjoy the independence of a state commission.\n \n\n   \n  According to two Israeli sources, Netanyahu seeks to prevent a future government from determining who investigates and who bears blame by establishing his own inquiry before elections that are due next year. What the October council families are demanding  –  a body capable of uncovering the full truth  –  is precisely what Netanyahu’s alternatives are designed to avoid.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the IDF has completed internal probes and the state comptroller’s office is conducting a broad investigation that tries to fill the void by extending beyond its usual remit. But without subpoena powers or a public mandate, their reports fall short from naming those responsible or recommending dismissals.\n \n\n   \n  For families who lost loved ones on October 7, technical reviews are no substitute for a national reckoning.\n \n\n   \n  “Every institution is investigating itself,” said Hila Abir, whose brother Lotan was murdered at the Nova music festival. “That’s not accountability. We need a real, independent commission that publishes findings and brings change - so that we never wake up to another October 7.”\n \n\n   \n  “We wake up every morning still not feeling safe,” Abir added. “That should worry every Israeli.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/john-beam-laney-college-shooting-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00.000Z","title":"John Beam, beloved former football coach featured in Netflix’s 'Last Chance U', dies after shooting on California campus","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Beam, a revered football coach and mentor at Laney College in Oakland, died from gunshot wounds sustained during a targeted shooting on November 16, 2025.

Beam, a cherished football coach whose mentorship and care touched the lives of thousands of people, has died after being shot Thursday on an Oakland college campus — a devastating loss for a California community still reeling from another act of school gun violence just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  The revered Bay Area football figure featured in Netflix documentary series “Last Chance U” was rushed to Highland Hospital in critical condition Thursday but died Friday morning, Oakland police homicide commander Lt. Gloria Beltran announced at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Police identified the suspect as 27-year-old Cedric Irving, Beltran said. The suspect was acquainted with Beam but did not have a close relationship with him, according to Oakland Assistant Chief of Police James Beere.\n \n\n   \n  For many, the news felt unthinkable.\n \n\n   \n  Piedmont Police Chief Frederick Shavies described Beam as a “father figure to thousands of not only men but young women,” someone who left an “indelible” imprint on Oakland and far beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds gathered for a vigil Thursday night, holding candles and hope as Beam fought for his life — the same way he had spent decades teaching young people to fight for their own, Shavies said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hearts are aching,” Shavies said, reflecting on the man he had known since eighth grade — the man who stepped in with support after Shavies’ father died.\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s family said in a statement read by police: “We are devastated that John — our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, coach, mentor and friend — has passed. Our hearts are full from the outpouring of love and support from all who cared about him. We are deeply grateful for your continued prayers and ask for privacy during this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, questions remain about what authorities described as a “very targeted incident,” as the suspect awaits formal charges. The case will be referred to the district attorney’s office for review.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about the suspect\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday at 11:53 a.m., Oakland Police officers responded to Laney College and found Beam suffering from gunshot wounds, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  Beam had been at the college’s fieldhouse, which houses the athletic training facilities, where he continued serving as athletic director after retiring as head football coach last year. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and listed in critical condition.\n \n\n   \n  Officials obtained photos of the suspect, who was later spotted at the San Leandro Bay Area Rapid Transit station. He was taken into custody and gave a statement to police regarding the shooting, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  “The ability to actually track the suspect after he left Laney College was a diligent effort and an amazing, heavy lift to go through hundreds of hours of surveillance footage so we could track that individual,” Beere, Oakland’s assistant chief of police, said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect played football at Skyline High School in Oakland, but not while Beam was employed there, authorities said. Although Irving was not a student at Laney College, he was often seen loitering on campus, Beere added.\n \n\n   \n  “Coach Beam, although (he and the suspect) did not have a close relationship, was open to helping everybody in our community, and this is not uncommon for him to have a relationship with someone that he would think needs help,” Beere said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said Irving was on campus for a specific purpose, though they did not specify what that was. While authorities described the encounter as targeted, Beere confirmed it was not connected to a robbery.\n \n\n   \n  Irving is scheduled to appear in court for his arraignment Tuesday morning at a courthouse in Oakland, according to online records for the inmate.\n \n\n   \n    A champion for second chances\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s impact on the game stretched across more than four decades. He began coaching in Oakland in 1982 as Skyline High School’s defensive coordinator before joining Laney College in 2004 as the running backs coach, later becoming offensive coordinator and eventually head coach in 2012. Under his leadership, Laney won two league titles.\n \n\n   \n  His influence reached far beyond the sidelines. More than 20 of Beam’s former players went on to the NFL, including seven who played in the Super Bowl, according to his  biography on the college’s website. \n \n\n   \n  His appearance in the 2020 season of “Last Chance U” introduced his tough-love mentorship style to a national audience and cemented his status as a champion for young athletes seeking a second chance.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Netflix for comment.\n \n\n   \n  To the Bay Area, Beam was more than a coach. He was a builder of people, a steady presence, a believer in potential.\n \n\n   \n  Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee reflected on the profound impact Beam had on the community, calling his legacy one “we all have to lift up, given the way he mentored young people, people who never would have had a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Beam coached the mayor’s nephew when he attended Skyline High School, she said, calling Beam “a phenomenal human being.” His influence transcended the football field, she added; he was a mentor, a friend, and a source of guidance for students, athletes and community members from all walks of life.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor described the city’s grief, noting the outpouring of support from people across Oakland as the community struggles with the loss.\n \n\n   \n  “He was friends with everyone and encouraged everyone. He never thought anyone was a lost cause,” Lee told CNN on Friday. “People feel the void already and are grieving this loss like you would not believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Athletes across the country took to social media to mourn Beam, sharing photos and memories that capture the stunning impact he had on their lives. Chicago Bears cornerback Nahshon Wright  posted a group photo with Beam , writing simply, “Will forever miss you dawg.” New Orleans Saints cornerback Rejzohn Wright shared a  heartfelt homage,  captioning a cheerful photo of a trio posing with Beam, “Crushed.”\n \n\n   \n  “I pray my prayers strong enough,” Wright wrote over a memorial video montage of Beam guiding and inspiring his athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Both athletes shared a video from April 2023, taken days before the NFL draft, showing Beam at football practice. Wearing his signature sunglasses and mustache, he jokes with the players while offering guidance — a fleeting, tender glimpse of the warmth, humor, and care that made him much more than a coach.\n \n\n   \n  Closing his remarks during the news conference, Shavies said, “I know that if Coach were here, he’d finish by saying, ‘Two claps — ready, ready.’”\n \n\n   \n    Another life ‘stolen’ by gun violence\n \n\n   \n  Laney College was  placed on lockdown  Thursday after reports of a shooting, as police secured the area and launched an investigation. The campus reopened Friday with mental health and counseling services available, the college said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Peralta community is devastated by his shooting,” Chancellor Tammeil Gilkerson said in a message to employees. “We are stunned and heartbroken that such violence has touched our campus and one of the most respected and beloved members of our Laney, Peralta, and Oakland community.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilkerson described Beam as “a renowned coach, teacher, mentor, and leader whose impact extends far beyond athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Lee condemned the killing, saying gun violence has “stolen” another life and warning that the city cannot allow firearms to continue flooding its streets and destroying the very people “who are trying to save our community.”\n \n\n   \n  “Coach’s Beam’s legacy isn’t measured in championships or statistics,” Lee said in the statement Friday. “It’s measured in the thousands of young people he believed in, mentored, and refused to abandon … He gave Oakland’s youth their best chance, and he never stopped fighting for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident is Oakland’s second school shooting in two days.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, one juvenile was shot and two were arrested at Skyline High School,  police said . The juvenile who was shot was taken to the hospital and was in stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “It is devastating,” Lee added. “Schools should be the safest spaces in our city. We need guns off our streets now.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/alice-wong-dies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Disability rights activist and author Alice Wong dies at 51","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alice Wong, a pioneering disability rights activist and author, died at 51 in San Francisco after a battle with an infection.

As the House moves toward a  bipartisan demand  for the FBI to release its Epstein files, Trump is trying to flip the script on what he’s now calling the “ Epstein Hoax. ”\n \n\n   \n  ►  Need a reset for the unpopular military policy in the Western hemisphere?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave the operation a new name, “ Southern Spear .”\n \n\n   \n  ► Hoping to make people believe a militaristic deportation strategy is focused on dangerous criminals instead of the preschool teachers and parents who have featured in recent news stories?\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled “ Operation Dirtbag ,” in which ICE announces the deportation of previously convicted sex offenders, among mothers, in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  That Noem announcement came the same week a judge in Illinois ordered hundreds of detainees rounded up in ICE’s “ Operation Midway Blitz ” to be released.\n \n\n   \n    Trying to make the people believe on affordability\n \n\n   \n  On affordability —  Trump’s most obvious political problem  at the moment — he is working hard to reframe his policies around that term to argue that they will drive costs down. In fact, tariffs are likely to drive costs up, and tax cuts passed by Republicans will predominantly  benefit the wealthiest  Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But it is the new name for Trump’s Venezuela policy that has the most obvious feel of a complete relaunch.\n \n\n   \n  Though it has not gotten authorization from Congress, the Pentagon has overseen the apparently extrajudicial killings of  80 alleged drug traffickers  in the Caribbean and Pacific — and counting.\n \n\n   \n  The administration says it is protecting Americans from “narco-terrorists,” although it’s not clear the strikes will do much to stop the flow of drugs into the country, and it is deeply unpopular —  less than a third  of Americans said they supported it in a Reuters poll released this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear the strategy has changed, but Hegseth gave the strategy a new name this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,” Hegseth said on X from his official “Secretary of War” account.\n \n\n   \n    To military watchers, Southern Spear sounds like more of the same\n \n\n   \n  It seems like “a rebranding of an operation that started back in January of 2025,” military analyst retired Maj. Mike Lyons said Friday on “CNN This Morning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think the Navy thought they wrapped it up during the summertime,” Lyons added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that Pentagon briefers went further, laying out military options to Trump for US military action inside Venezuela. Trump on Friday suggested he has  made up his mind  on a path forward in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican and Air Force veteran, has said presidents should make the argument for why military action was in American interests and, when necessary, get authorization from lawmakers, as the Constitution requires.\n \n\n   \n  None of that has happened yet regarding Venezuela or the targeting of suspected drug boats, Bacon told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “I implore the president and his team, make your case to the American people, when you’re using our military and you’re going to pursue hostilities there has to be support from the people, and you need to get support from Congress,” Bacon said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump could look to the legacy of President George H.W. Bush, who launched the popular  Operation Desert Storm  to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion in the early ‘90s.\n \n\n   \n  Bush also launched Operation Just Cause in 1989 to arrest and depose Gen. Manual Noriega in Panama. That operation may have played well for him in the US and led to the capture of Noreiga, but Panama today marks its anniversary with a  national day of mourning  for the hundreds of civilians who were killed.\n \n\n   \n    Call it a hoax\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s strategies for bending public perception are well-documented. He almost never says “Democrats” without also adding “radical left,” for instance.\n \n\n   \n  His go-to method for defusing a controversy and reframe something in the public’s mind is to call it a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  A serious investigation by a special counsel into contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russians during the 2016 election has years later, by force of his constant repetition, been turned into the “ Russia Hoax .”\n \n\n   \n  Now he’s doing the same thing by trying to turn calls to release the Epstein files into the “Epstein Hoax.”\n \n\n   \n    On policy that touches people’s lives, rebranding is difficult\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers took Trump’s cue and officially named the massive tax and spending cut law they passed as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” That’s its name in US law.\n \n\n   \n  “That was good for getting it approved, but it’s not good for explaining to people what it’s all about,” Trump said back in August. He has yet to come up with something better, but he may be more focused today on trying to convince Americans he is addressing the affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  He claims prices have fallen, but Americans  aren’t experiencing that  in their daily lives.\n \n\n   \n    Is the MAGA brand bigger than Trump?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also struggled recently to control his own most famous catchphrase, MAGA, or “make America great again.”\n \n\n   \n  It is his brand, but he was at odds with other MAGA adherents on the subject of immigration.\n \n\n   \n  In a sometimes-contentious interview with the  Fox News personality Laura Ingraham,  Trump defended the idea of visas for  skilled immigrants.  He said the US did not have enough workers for certain jobs, which did not sit well with Ingraham. She argued that MAGA believers think the US has plenty of talent.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea,” Trump shot back. “I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.”\n \n\n   \n  But he may be losing a little bit of control over the MAGA brand.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/us-russia-nuclear-treaty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Last nuclear treaty between US and Russia nears expiration as Trump and Putin trade testing threats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the New START treaty between the US and Russia approaches expiration in February 2026, President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin have engaged in a series of provocative public exchanges, including threats to restart nuclear testing.

AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spent weeks trading threats to restart nuclear tests, an escalation kicked off by Putin’s boasts about tests of the Poseidon nuclear powered missile in late October.\n \n\n   \n  Days later Trump declared that he had ordered the first US nuclear test in three decades.\n \n\n   \n  The leaders’ provocative public statements, including a Russian reply that it too would explore restarting nuclear weapons testing, have raised global concerns about a new nuclear arms race. Behind the scenes, both sides are also eyeing a critical upcoming deadline: February 4, when the singular remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the nations is set to expire.\n \n\n   \n  The New START treaty limits both countries to a maximum of 1,550 deployed long-range nuclear warheads on delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers. After a five-year extension signed by President Joe Biden, the treaty is set to expire early next year with little indication of momentum towards a new agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s National Security Council called a meeting with nuclear weapons experts during the lead-up to summit between Trump and Putin in August, according to four sources familiar with the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The wide-ranging discussion included the potential benefits of extending the current cap on deployed nuclear weapons that the US and Russia have agreed to, whether or not to expand the size of the US nuclear arsenal and the status of the US nuclear triad, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House wanted to be prepared for any possible nuclear discussion between the two leaders of the world’s greatest nuclear arsenals.\n \n\n   \n  But the leaders’ meeting ended without momentum towards ending the Ukraine War or the announcement of any nuclear weapons agreement.\n \n\n   \n  When Putin publicly proposed an extension of the single lasting nuclear arms control agreement between the US and Russia weeks later Trump responded positively.\n \n\n   \n  “It sounds like a good idea to me,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, more than a month later, neither side says ongoing talks to achieve that goal are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday there are conversations about “potentially” speaking to Russia about the treaty.\n \n\n   \n  Russia suspended participation in a critical monitoring mechanism in the treaty in 2023, though it was already essentially paused due to Russia’s refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. Those inspections were paused during the COVID-19 pandemic but never resumed after the pandemic ended largely because of US opposition over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Still, both sides appear to have maintained adherence to the treaty’s cap on strategic nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Questions over whether or not those caps will remain in place come as the Russians are testing new nuclear systems – though there are no reports of warhead testing — and the Chinese are  rapidly developing and expanding  their nuclear and ballistic arsenal.\n \n\n   \n  Experts are not worried about an overnight calamity if there is no form of an agreed to cap, but it would be the first time in decades the US and Russia could deploy long-range nuclear weapons without restraint. That situation could trigger dangerous miscalculations.\n \n\n   \n  “The biggest worry is that for the first time since 1991, the US would not have any mutual restraint with Russia on strategic weapons,” said Corey Hinderstein, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for Nuclear Peace. “Along with the restraint also came lots of other mutual verification – and to be blind in that way for the first time in more than 30 years has the potential to lead to misunderstanding, miscalculation, and a lack of engagement that could be important in fending off a crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  Some experts point out that a political agreement between the two sides to agree to maintain the treaty’s cap on deployed nuclear weapons would be effective and could be done relatively quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Russian officials have indicated the country will not pursue their proposal of an extension indefinitely. Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister has called Putin’s suggestion of renewing a “limited offer for a limited time” in at least one private setting, one source familiar with the remarks said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has not officially responded to Russia’s proposal, two sources said. There is mounting Republican pressure not to agree to an extension of the deal, but Trump has expressed an interest in limits on nuclear weapons and arms control not just with Russia, but also with China.\n \n\n   \n  “The president will decide the path forward on nuclear arms control, which he will clarify on his own timeline,” said a White House official. “President Trump has spoken repeatedly of addressing the threat nuclear weapons pose to the world and has indicated that he would like to keep limits on nuclear weapons and involve China in arms control talks.”\n \n\n   \n    To extend, or not to extend\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s testing of the nuclear-powered underwater Poseidon drone and a nuclear-capable cruise missile came just after Putin’s proposal to extend the treaty in what appeared to be Russian efforts to pressure the US to the table. But the moves were “counterproductive,” explained one US official.\n \n\n   \n  While the weapons’ development wasn’t covered by the treaty, “testing them frustrated US officials who viewed the move as saber rattling by Russia, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  “They also very clearly realized that extending New START would do nothing to prevent Russia from further tests of those systems,” the official added.\n \n\n   \n  If anything, those tests pushed Trump further way from wanting to discuss a follow-on agreement with Putin, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Top nuclear and energy officials are due to meet this week with Trump to try to dissuade him from conducting nuclear warhead tests, an effort to find an offramp from the escalating rhetoric,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic lawmakers have urged Trump to work toward replacing the treaty, and there is fresh urgency after Trump’s and Putin’s remarks about testing.\n \n\n   \n  But other lawmakers, and some experts, argue that Trump shouldn’t extend the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “New START confines the US to 2011 levels of deployed nuclear weapons so if you are confident in having limits according to a world that does not exist anymore then an extension is fine,” said Frank Miller, a principal at the Scowcroft Group who worked for decades on nuclear policy and arms control at the Pentagon. “But the current agreement stops the US from uploading – which is putting more warheads on our missiles to cover China and Russia simultaneously – and takes the wind out of the sails of modernization.”\n \n\n   \n  There are some concerns about the US intelligence community maintaining an accurate assessment of Russia’s nuclear arsenal if the treaty is no longer intact.\n \n\n   \n  “When you no longer have treaty no longer have the legal requirement to monitor compliance on the treaty it is possible that US confidence in what Russia is doing slowly erodes over time,” said Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  Complicating the picture of US and Russia negotiations is Trump’s interest in potentially including China in a three-party deal.\n \n\n   \n  It is an idea that his administration actively worked towards during his first term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials at that time believed China might effectively engage if the US and Russia agreed to a yearlong freeze on new warhead production and the deployment of nuclear warheads, one former official explained. China was also starting to talk to the US about the subject, even though it was at a very low level.\n \n\n   \n  “We believed that when China began engaging in talks about talks that they had resigned themselves to the inevitability of having to negotiate eventually – and we were building the leverage to get them there,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  But when Biden won the election the Chinese and Russians backed away from the quiet talks. Biden swiftly extended new start for five years, putting the issue directly in Trump’s plate once again.\n \n\n   \n  With China’s nuclear buildup ongoing, many believe the China will not come to the table for talks until it has reached parity with the US in terms of how many nuclear weapons the country has in stock, which is expected to happen in 2030.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re the number one nuclear power, which I hate admit, because it’s so horrible. It’s such a horrible situation if it ever had to be used. Russia’s second, China’s a distant third, but they’ll catch us within four or five years,” Trump said earlier this month. “We’re maybe working on a plan to denuclearize the three of us.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials say there is no current plan being actively worked on to drive a trilateral deal.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/saudi-crown-prince-trump-white-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump pulling out all the stops to welcome Saudi crown prince for first White House visit since Khashoggi killing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is preparing to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House with full state visit honors, marking the prince’s first visit in over seven years and signaling a strategic effort to advance the Abraham Accords, especially by pushing for Saudi normalization with Israel.

crown prince for first White House visit since Khashoggi killing \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kristen Holmes, Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  is planning to receive Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House this week with all the trappings of a state visit, sources familiar with the matter said, including a welcome ceremony in the morning and a formal dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re more than meeting,” Trump said late Friday as he flew to Florida for the weekend. “We’re honoring Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince.”\n \n\n   \n  While the White House has decided to pull out all the stops, the visit cannot be classified as an official state visit as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia’s head of state. That position is occupied by his 89-year-old father, King Salman. But the crown prince has assumed almost all day-to-day responsibility for ruling the kingdom, and attends summits and other diplomatic engagements as the country’s leader.\n \n\n   \n  The meetings Tuesday will mark Prince bin Salman’s first visit to the White House in more than seven years. Trump has worked to cultivate a close relationship with the kingdom’s de facto ruler in the hopes he will decide to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, which would be a major advancement of the president’s signature Abraham Accords — a longtime goal of the president’s.\n \n\n   \n  “The Abraham Accords will be a part we’re going to be discussing,” Trump said Friday. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.”\n \n\n   \n  The prince last visited Washington in 2018, months before the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. A CIA assessment released afterward found the prince had likely ordered the assassination, though he has long denied any involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Trump never entirely cut off ties with the crown prince during his first term, though he wasn’t invited back to the White House. Even Trump’s successor President Joe Biden, who vowed as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its human rights record, visited Riyadh while in office and fist bumped Prince bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  With Tuesday’s visit, any semblance of a rupture in US-Saudi ties appears to have disappeared. The plans include a welcome ceremony involving military bands, a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office and a black-tie dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  The first tranche of invitations has been sent out and the guest list includes largely chief executives, as well as lawmakers and governors — some of whom Trump himself called to invite to the dinner, people familiar with the plans said. The event will be coordinated by first lady Melania Trump, as all state visits are planned through the first lady’s office.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to hold a state visit in his second term, which is typically put on as a sign of friendship and to display the close relationship the US shares with its allies, during his second term. Trump broke with tradition during his first administration by opting not to hold a state dinner during his first year in office, though he went on to host the president of France and prime minister of Australia in 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit,” a White House official said in a statement to CNN. “We will not get ahead of the President on conversations that are occurring ahead of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia is also planning an investment summit to coincide with the crown prince’s trip to Washington. The event at the Kennedy Center, a day after the White House visit, is intended to link up American and Saudi business leaders for financial opportunities.\n \n\n   \n  In May, Trump visited Saudi Arabia for the first state visit of his second term and was welcomed with  elaborate pageantry , including a fighter jet escort, an honor guard with golden swords and a fleet of Arabian horses accompanying his limousine. The president has sought to deepen ties to other Gulf states during his tenure, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n \n\n   \n  Before the May stop, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the United States. Trump brought several American executives with him to Riyadh, and signed several agreements. Many have yet to be fully implemented.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s meetings, US and Saudi officials were working to finalize agreements on defense and security cooperation, including major new purchases of American-made fighter jets and weapons, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who is the younger brother of the crown prince, was in Washington a week ahead of the visit for meetings with top Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “We explored ways to bolster our strategic cooperation. We also addressed regional and international developments,” Khalid bin Salman wrote afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Atop Trump’s agenda will be a discussion of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, a step he believes is within reach after he helped broker a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The October 7, 2023, terror attack in Israel, and the war that followed, largely put on hold the normalization discussions that began during Trump’s first term and advanced during Biden’s. A framework being discussed before the attacks would include a US defense treaty with Saudi Arabia and help building a civilian nuclear program in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Biden and many of his top aides have said they believe the October 7 attack was intended, in part, to obstruct the normalization talks. Now that a ceasefire is in place, Trump believes a deal can be quickly reached.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in,” Trump told Fox News last month. “I think they’re going to all go in very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some hurdles remain in getting the crown prince on board. While he and Trump are expected to sign a defense cooperation agreement Tuesday, it falls short of the treaty under discussion in earlier phases of normalization discussions, the US official said. A formal treaty would require congressional approval.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia has also said a condition to normalizing ties with Israel is a “credible” and “irreversible” pathway to Palestinian statehood, which the Gaza plan Trump helped broker stops short of providing.\n \n\n   \n  American officials were nonetheless hopeful about making progress on the issue during Tuesday’s meeting.\n \n\n   \n  One of the architects of the Abraham Accords, Trump’s son-in-law  Jared Kushner , visited Riyadh last week for talks with the crown prince ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, a White House official and a person familiar with the matter said. Kushner has long had a close, personal relationship with the Saudi prince, and has been deployed several times in recent months to use his ties to Mideast leaders to help lay the groundwork for Trump’s agenda and build upon the Abraham Accords.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the sensitive dynamic of the visit are Trump’s  personal financial interests in the region . The Trump Organization, which is being run by the president’s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is involved in major real estate projects in Saudi Arabia. Kushner also has significant business ties to the country. Kushner’s investment fund, Affinity Partners, has raised billions of dollars in capital from Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/business/penny-nickel-discontinue-currency","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-05:00","title":"With the end of the penny, is the clock ticking for the nickel?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Mint has ceased producing pennies in 2025 due to production costs exceeding their face value, and the nickel—currently facing similar financial issues—is now under scrutiny.

\nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The American penny is history. The nickel might be next.\n \n\n   \n  The  last pennies were pressed  at the US Mint in Philadelphia on Wednesday, a victim of production costs higher than their worth coupled with limited usefulness. While the penny remains legal tender, banks and merchants are already reporting shortages.\n \n\n   \n  But the factors that prompted the government to stop making pennies are even truer for the nickel. Pennies cost nearly 5 cents to make – 4 cents more than they’re worth. The nickel’s net loss is nearly 9 cents per coin.\n \n\n   \n  Nickels are 75% copper and 25% nickel, while pennies — despite their reputation as a copper coin — are copper-plated zinc, meaning they are 97.5% zinc and only 2.5% copper.\n \n\n   \n  While metal prices can be volatile, zinc costs about the same as it did in late 2016; copper and nickel prices cost roughly double since then.\n \n\n   \n  The US Mint and one of its suppliers, Artazn, have been studying ways to get the cost of making a nickel down to less than 5 cents, said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, which describes itself as one of the world’s oldest and largest producers of solid zinc strip and zinc products. Artazn makes the blanks used by the US Mint to press coins.\n \n\n   \n  “It just so happens that copper and nickel are two of the more expensive metals you could be using,” Weller said. Getting nickel production costs to close to 5 cents per coin could be completed within a year, he said, with a “new” nickel that looks identical to the current nickel.\n \n\n   \n  But the nickel’s problems don’t end with the production costs. Like the penny, the nickel is limited in its usefulness. Americans are using coins less and less often, even when they use cash.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries were quicker to retire their small-change coins. New Zealand and Australia both eliminated the production of their nickels in the early years of this century and within 20 years of when they stopped making their pennies.\n \n\n   \n  Using cash less often reduces the pressure to drop the nickel, as would reducing the cost of production, said David Smith, a professor of economics at the Graziadio School of Business and Management at Pepperdine University. Smith, an avid coin collector, also thinks there is enough nostalgia for the   coins to slow any move toward eliminating them. But he believes it will eventually happen, even if it takes 15 or 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  Weller said getting rid of coins and moving toward a cashless economy causes problems, especially for lower income consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “The move away from cash really benefits big banks and credit card companies,” he said. “They’re charging businesses every time someone swipes their cards, and those costs end up being passed onto consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  Merchants dealing with a penny shortage are trying to figure out whether they’re allowed to round purchases to the nearest 5 cents and have called on Congress to pass legislation to confirm the move.\n \n\n   \n  Rounding cash purchases to the nearest 10 cents rather than the nearest 5 cents could cause additional problems. A study earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond found that while rounding purchases to the nearest nickel would cost American consumers a total of $6 million a year, the similar “rounding tax” from eliminating nickels and going to the nearest dime would be $56 million.\n \n\n   \n  But even that would come to only an average 42 cents for each of the nation’s 133 million households.\n \n\n   \n  And changing the nickel’s composition wouldn’t eliminate all production cost concerns. Even if a “new” nickel cost less than 5 cents, it’ll be tough to stay below that level, especially since 2.8 cents of the cost of each nickel comes from administrative and distribution costs, not materials and production.\n \n\n   \n  Both Weller and Smith don’t expect the nickel to go away anytime soon. The Mint lost money on every penny and every nickel it had made since 2006, Weller said, and it only stopped making pennies this year.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve had reporters calling me about the future of the penny for the last 30 or 35 years,” Weller said. “So I don’t see there being an immediate change.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/americas/us-military-drills-venezuela-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-05:00","title":"Venezuela’s Maduro denounces US military drills in Trinidad and Tobago amid heightened tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has strongly condemned US military drills in Trinidad and Tobago, accusing the United States of launching a 'criminal war' and threatening Caribbean peace.

  \n  A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the hate crime  convictions  of three White men who chased Ahmaud Arbery through their Georgia subdivision with pickup trucks before one of them killed the running Black man with a shotgun.\n \n\n   \n  A three-judge panel of the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals took well over a year to rule after attorneys for the defendants urged the judges in March 2024 to  overturn the case , arguing the men’s history of racist text messages and social media posts failed to prove they targeted Arbery because of his race.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors used those posts and messages in 2022 to persuade a jury that Arbery’s killing was  motivated  by “pent-up racial anger.”\n \n\n   \n  The appellate panel’s opinion, written by Judge Elizabeth L. Branch, said prosecutors at the trial showed “that each of the defendants held longstanding prejudice,” and that evidence was sufficient for “a reasonable juror to find that Arbery’s race was the determinative factor” for the deadly neighborhood chase.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the appeals judges had thrown out their hate-crime convictions, the trio faced no immediate reprieve from prison. That’s because they’re also serving life sentences for murder after being convicted in a Georgia state court.\n \n\n   \n    Video of Arbery’s killing fueled national outrage\n \n\n   \n  Father and son Greg and Travis McMichael armed themselves and used a pickup truck to pursue 25-year-old Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. A neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan, joined the chase and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range.\n \n\n   \n  More than two months passed without arrests, until Bryan’s graphic video of the killing leaked online. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police as outrage over Arbery’s death became part of a national outcry over racial injustice. Charges soon followed.\n \n\n   \n  All three men were  convicted  of murder by a state court in late 2021. After a second trial in US District Court in early 2022, a jury found the trio guilty of hate crimes and attempted kidnapping.\n \n\n   \n  Greg McMichael’s attorney in the hate crimes case, A.J. Balbo, declined to comment on the appellate ruling. Attorneys for Bryan and Travis McMichael did not immediately return phone and email messages.\n \n\n   \n    Defense argued racist messages didn’t prove racism against Arbery\n \n\n   \n  In their federal appeals, lawyers for Bryan and Greg McMichael criticized prosecutors’ use of more than two dozen social media posts and text messages, as well as witness testimony, that showed all three men using racist slurs or otherwise disparaging Black people.\n \n\n   \n  Bryan’s attorney, Pete Theodocion, argued those statements were so repulsive that prosecutors were able to sway the jury without proving a racist intent to harm Arbery himself.\n \n\n   \n  Balbo, Greg McMichael’s lawyer, insisted his client initiated the pursuit of Arbery because he mistakenly suspected him of being a fleeing criminal. The McMichaels had seen security camera videos in prior months that showed Arbery entering a neighboring home under construction.\n \n\n   \n  The 11th Circuit judges rejected those arguments, noting there was no evidence Arbery had committed any crimes in the men’s neighborhood. He was unarmed and had no stolen property when he was killed.\n \n\n   \n  In Travis McMichael’s appeal, attorney Amy Lee Copeland didn’t dispute the jury’s finding that he was motivated by racism. The  social media evidence  included a 2018 Facebook comment Travis McMichael made on a video of a Black man playing a prank on a White person. He used an expletive and a racial slur when writing he’d kill him.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Copeland based her appeal on legal technicalities. She said that prosecutors failed to prove the streets of the Satilla Shores subdivision where Arbery was killed were public roads, as stated in the indictment used to charge the men. The 11th Circuit rejected her argument.\n \n\n   \n  The trial judge sentenced both McMichaels to life in prison for their hate crime convictions, plus additional time — 10 years for Travis McMichael and seven years for his father — for brandishing guns while committing violent crimes. Bryan received a lighter hate crime sentence of 35 years in prison, in part because he wasn’t armed and preserved the cellphone video that became crucial evidence.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/john-fetterman-back-home-hospital-fall","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Pennsylvania Sen.

John Fetterman is back home from the hospital, the Pennsylvania Democrat announced on social media Saturday, after  receiving care  at a Pittsburgh hospital for a fall he suffered this week.\n \n\n   \n  “20 stitches later and a full recovery, I’m back home with @giselefetterman and the kids,” Fetterman said in a  post on X , tagging his wife. The post included a photo showing cuts on the senator’s face, stretching from above his eyebrow to his nose.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m overwhelmed + profoundly grateful for all the well-wishes,” the senator added, going on to thank the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman’s spokesperson said Thursday the senator fell during a morning walk near his Braddock, Pennsylvania, home, and was taken to the hospital “out of an abundance of caution.”\n \n\n   \n  “Upon evaluation, it was established he had a ventricular fibrillation flare-up that led to Senator Fetterman feeling light-headed, falling to the ground and hitting his face with minor injuries,” his spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson added that Fetterman opted to stay in the hospital “so doctors can fine-tune his medication regimen.”\n \n\n   \n  The fall marked the latest in a series of health issues Fetterman has faced in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  During his 2022 Senate campaign, Fetterman suffered a  near-fatal stroke . Fetterman’s  campaign announced  he had undergone the “standard procedure to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator.”\n \n\n   \n  When he returned to the campaign trail, his speech was halting and at times difficult to follow. During an October 2022 debate against his opponent Mehmet Oz — which he describes as a turning point of when “the depression really started to set in” — he dropped words during answers and occasionally lost his train of thought.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, Fetterman received treatment for clinical depression after  checking himself  in to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He has since publicly discussed how his tough Senate race in 2022  worsened his mental health .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, current and former staffers asserted in a New York Magazine article that Fetterman  had been exhibiting  reckless and volatile behavior, raising questions over his fitness to serve.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman has often  disagreed with his own party , particularly on the issue of Israel’s war against Hamas. He also recently broke with the Democratic Party during the government shutdown and repeatedly voted in favor of the GOP funding plan. Ultimately, a separate plan ended the government shutdown with the help of  Fetterman and seven other centrists .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/americas/us-haiti-embassy-fire-gangs-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-05:00","title":"Suspected Haitian Gang Members Exchange Fire with Marines Protecting US Embassy in Port-au-Prince","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent incident on Thursday, November 13, 2025, suspected Haitian gang members exchanged fire with US Marines protecting the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with no injuries reported among the Marines.

some businesses to shutter \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:04 PM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   Charlotte (AP) —  Federal officials confirmed Saturday that a surge of  immigration enforcement  in North Carolina’s largest city has begun, as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.\n \n\n   \n  “Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”\n \n\n   \n  Local officials including Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions,  saying in a statement  that they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.\n \n\n   \n  Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics.\n \n\n   \n  But President Donald Trump’s administration has  seized upon the fatal stabbing  of Ukrainian refugee  Iryna Zarutska  on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman’s murder.\n \n\n   \n    Enforcement begins after rumors\n \n\n   \n  The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden  said this week  that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born US citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.”\n \n\n   \n  Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “I told them, ‘I’m an American citizen,’” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.\n \n\n   \n  Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by  US Customs and Border Protection  and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them ‘fishing,’” Asciutto said.\n \n\n   \n    An encounter in a front yard\n \n\n   \n  In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton’s front yard in the morning when two CBP agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.\n \n\n   \n  “This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we’ve got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They’ve broken no laws, and that’s what concerns me,” said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.\n \n\n   \n  Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “Half an hour later, he’s in our yard, he’s working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They’re here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there’s just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”\n \n\n   \n    Some businesses close\n \n\n   \n  JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.\n \n\n   \n  Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he said. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for US citizens.”\n \n\n   \n  Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and “We’re brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don’t know how long this is going to last.”\n \n\n   \n  The  Trump administration  has defended  unprecedented federal enforcement  operations in cities like  Los Angeles  and  Chicago  as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.\n \n\n   \n  Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials “have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order” and are “demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,” Kirby said in a statement. “Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.”\n \n\n   \n  But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” and notify local law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has emphasized that it is not involved in federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/india/india-delhi-university-academic-freedom-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"Why an email about cows is intensifying concerns about academic freedom in India","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Delhi University, long celebrated as a leader of free speech and secular academic thought, canceled a long-standing seminar on 'Land, Property and Democratic Rights' on October 31, 2025, the same day it issued a directive encouraging faculty and students to attend a government-affiliated 'National Godhan (Cow Herd) Summit' promoting cow welfare.

is intensifying concerns about academic freedom in India \n       \n  By Esha Mitra, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:20 PM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of India’s most prestigious universities has been accused of compromising its academic freedom by cancelling a seminar on democracy the same day it issued a directive to staff to promote a summit on cow welfare.\n \n\n   \n  Cows are revered as sacred by many Hindus, but critics say Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is using India’s devotion to the bovine as a political tool to elevate its Hindu nationalist agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Professors and students at Delhi University ,  long seen as bulwark of free speech in the country, say the directive   is another example of the pressures placed on educational institutions by the Modi government as it pushes Hinduism in a democracy founded on secular values.\n \n\n   \n  The “promotion of this dubious event juxtaposed with the suppression of a critical social science seminar, reveals a clear bias against scientific temper,” said the Democratic Teachers Front, an organization that advocates for the rights and interests of students and teachers, in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The canceled seminar, titled “Land, Property and Democratic Rights” was part of a lecture series that has been running at Delhi University for six decades.\n \n\n   \n  Notice of the administration’s decision to cancel the October 31 event came the same day as a directive from the Dean of Colleges, Balaram Pani, to principals encouraging students and faculty members to attend the “National Godhan (cow herd) Summit,” according to a copy of an email seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The summit was billed as “a landmark event dedicated to the welfare of cows,” by organizers on its website.\n \n\n   \n  Pani told local news outlet Times Now that the university was supporting, not promoting, the cow summit.\n \n\n   \n  “If someone is working in the nation’s interest – supporting economic growth and improving the environment – why shouldn’t we support that? said Pani, according to the outlet.\n \n\n   \n  “However, we are not promoting this event,” the dean added. “And if any event goes against national interests, we will not support it under any circumstance.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Pani for further comment and to the registrar of Delhi University.\n \n\n   \n    Summit to discuss cow welfare\n \n\n   \n  The off-campus event, hosted by the National Godhan (Cow Herd) Organization, an NGO affiliated with the government, runs until November 10. The group describes itself as an “Idealistic Non-Violent Movement dedicated to the welfare of cows and the promotion of cow-based sustainable innovations.”\n \n\n   \n  In its statement, the Democratic Teachers Front said the administration’s decision to support a cow summit over a seminar on democracy was “a deliberate effort to hollow out the legacy of India’s post-1947 achievements in both natural and social sciences,” referring to the end of British rule of India.\n \n\n   \n  Nandini Sundar, a professor of sociology and the convener of the canceled seminar, accused the government of a deliberate ideological crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “(They) are trying to destroy public universities, critical thought, only allow Hindutva thought,” Sundar told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Hindutva is a political ideology that seeks to define the Indian national identity based on a shared Hindu culture and history. Critics say it is a vision that inherently excludes India’s diverse minority communities.\n \n\n   \n  Around 80% of the country’s population were recorded as Hindu at the last Census in 2011, with around 14% listed as Muslim, India’s largest minority. There are also many followers of other faiths including Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism and other local religions.\n \n\n   \n  Namita Wahi, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, had been booked to deliver the seminar – she’s also the founding director of the Lands Rights Initiative, and a longtime critic of the Modi government’s use of land laws to acquire property for various projects in contravention of community land rights.\n \n\n   \n  Sundar said no reasons were initially given for the cancelation, writing in a  statement :  “We can only speculate that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-led government is scared of any discussion around land and democratic rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Modi’s BJP has its ideological roots in the RSS, a century-old right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates Hindu supremacy within India. The group has repeatedly said it does not discriminate against minorities.\n \n\n   \n  Local media outlets reported that the registrar said the seminar was cancelled because prior permission was not sought.\n \n\n   \n  “Prior permission has not been needed for the last 60 years,” Sundar said in her statement. After checking with other departments, she said “nobody takes prior permission for each speaker in their regular seminar series.”\n \n\n   \n  Aryan Maan, a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a student organization affiliated with the RSS and the president of the Delhi University Student Union, said organizations like the RSS have no influence over the university’s administration and that its departments function independently.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the RSS but did not receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Sundar has since resigned from her position as convener of the seminar, a position she held for two years, due to the cancelation.\n \n\n   \n    Shrinking freedoms\n \n\n   \n  Institutions like Delhi University have long been celebrated as bastions of free speech and secular thought.\n \n\n   \n  They were central to student movements during the struggle for independence from British rule and later stood as hubs of opposition to the authoritarian state of emergency imposed by the then ruling Indian National Congress party in the 1970s.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, in 2019, these campuses became the epicenter of nationwide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), a controversial law that critics say discriminates against Muslims by making faith a criterion for citizenship.\n \n\n   \n  “Public universities have been a space where people have been freely debating, and they’re accessible to everyone in theory: people of all classes, castes,” Sundar said. “They’ve played a very important role in generating social mobility and free inquiry in a way that private universities simply can’t.”\n \n\n   \n  However, these institutions have also been increasingly branded as hotbeds of “anti-national” activity by many Modi supporters, with students and professors feeling the brunt   of it.\n \n\n   \n  Appointments to administrative positions within public universities are contingent upon government approval. This creates barriers to what can be taught and the production of academic work, Sundar said.\n \n\n   \n  A PhD scholar at Delhi University told CNN he wanted to research the rise of right-wing governments but was forced to change his subject to secure admission to the university.\n \n\n   \n  “Earlier, you could at least protest… but now the police crackdown on any student body movement is swift and immediate,” said the doctoral fellow, who asked to remain anonymous fearing backlash from the university.\n \n\n   \n  “The ability to think critically and make rational arguments has shrunk because they hold your degree as ransom. They have taken away our academic freedom,” the PhD scholar said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Indian Academic Freedom Network, which documents violations of academic freedom in Indian universities,  noted  that universities hosted more than 50 events and lectures on Hindutva, or those promoting the policies of the BJP, in the past year.\n \n\n   \n  The network also  documented  dozens of instances of alleged interference with syllabi, including banning books considered critical of the government, and denying permission for, or disrupting seminars about subjects like democracy and freedom of expression.\n \n\n   \n  However, Maan, the president of the Delhi University Student Union   and member of an RSS-affiliated student group, said that rather than curtailing free speech, the RSS has had a positive impact on university spaces.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s more academic freedom and the number of subjects have increased,” he said, pointing to recently established Centre for Hindu Studies as an example of the university’s expanding scope.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the federal and Delhi ministers of education for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Cow as a political tool\n \n\n   \n  The elevation of the cow from a religious symbol to an expression of national pride has been a cornerstone of the BJP’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  When Modi was elected with a roaring majority in 2014, his party’s manifesto pledged to protect the animal as part of preserving India’s cultural heritage, fulfilling a decades-long campaign by the RSS for stricter legislation against cow slaughter.\n \n\n   \n  While some anti-slaughter laws existed previously, the BJP’s tenure has seen several states enact stricter legislation. This legal crackdown has been accompanied by a rise in vigilante violence against people, typically Muslims accused of disrespecting the revered bovine.\n \n\n   \n  The  2021 report  from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project noted that right-wing Hindu nationalist groups like the RSS “have been emboldened to attack minority groups.”\n \n\n   \n  Delhi University’s Sundar called the shrinking academic freedoms “tragic.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many excellent public universities have already been destroyed; now the remaining ones will be finished as well.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/us/national-guard-troops-chicago-portland","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"10:16:00-15:00","title":"Texas National Guard troops expected to leave Chicago and return home, source says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Texas National Guard troops federalized by President Donald Trump in early October to protect federal immigration personnel in Chicago are now expected to leave the city and return home, following a federal court ruling by Judge April Perry that found no credible evidence of rebellion in Illinois and deemed the Department of Homeland Security's protest assessments unreliable.

10:16 PM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Texas National Guard troops are expected to leave Chicago and return to their home state very soon, a source familiar with the planning told CNN, after weeks in limbo as a court battle played out over the legality of their deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Specific timing is unclear but preparations are now underway for their departure, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Two hundred federalized troops had arrived in the city over a month ago with a mission from the Trump administration to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel – but instead stayed waiting at training bases for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The deployment was halted by a  federal judge  who said there was no justification to bring in the military. And the  Supreme Court  took the rare step of asking for additional briefing in that high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  The Texas National Guard members had been activated by President Donald Trump under Title 10 status in early October, and drew immediate backlash amid increasingly tense protests at the ICE facility in the suburb of Broadview, Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  The administration also federalized 300 troops from the Illinois National Guard last month to respond to the greater Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, US Northern Command said, “in the coming days, the Department will be shifting and/or rightsizing our Title 10 footprint in Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago to ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.”\n \n\n   \n  Northern Command declined to comment further when asked what this will mean for troops in those cities.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has  framed demonstrations  in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as “violent protests” carried out by “domestic terrorists,” arguing that military deployments to the cities are necessary to protect federal immigration personnel and property — despite state and city leaders’ insistence that the protests have been largely peaceful and any violence has been easily dealt with by local law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  The departure of Texas troops comes about a month after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a  scathing ruling  halting the deployment in Chicago, saying she had seen “no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers and calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n  The  Supreme Court  late last month asked for additional briefing in the case, questioning whether those troops can be used under the federal law at issue to augment immigration officials. The Department of Justice and Illinois officials were asked to address that issue in a series of new briefs due through mid-November.\n \n\n   \n    Legal sagas over deployments\n \n\n   \n  The legal sagas over the Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles deployments – dealing with the balance of presidential and state power – have seen numerous twists and turns as they unfolded in both district courts and before appeals judges.\n \n\n   \n  While attempting to deploy hundreds of troops to Chicago and Portland, the Trump administration compared the cities to a war zone, saying there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion” there.\n \n\n   \n  “You look at a place like Portland, it’s just — it’s ridiculous, when they say that there’s no problem. The place is — it was on fire over the weekend,” the president said last month.\n \n\n   \n  The deployments there came after Trump mobilized thousands of National Guard members to the Los Angeles area this summer to quell protests – a move the state’s Democratic leaders cast as an unnecessary escalation amid demonstrations over the administration’s immigration policies.\n \n\n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom  sued the Trump administration  in June over the federalization of the California troops and joined a  lawsuit in Oregon  over Trump’s attempt to send federalized troops in Los Angeles to Portland to respond to protests there.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge ruled in September that Trump  violated federal law  by using thousands of federalized California National Guard members and US Marines to help carry out law enforcement activities during the aggressive immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s attempt to invoke a rarely used law to deploy National Guard troops to several major American cities to curb crime and shut down protests has come up against multiple legal challenges.\n \n\n   \n  The president can federalize the states’ National Guard for US operations in the case of an emergency when “regular forces” are unable to enforce federal law. Exactly what the law means by “regular forces” is still being discussed in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s call-ups this year in the Democrat-led cities, the last time the National Guard was put under federal control for an operation within American borders was during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 – and it was coordinated with state officials at the time.\n \n\n   \n  There were also National Guard troops deployed to Memphis and Washington, DC – but not federalized under Title 10.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced in  August  he is placing the Washington, DC, police department “ under direct federal control ” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation’s capital, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the city.\n \n\n   \n  The president then brought the model to Tennessee next.\n \n\n   \n  Like in Washington, DC, the National Guard troops in Memphis are not dedicated just to securing federal property but are also supporting local law enforcement in their operations.\n \n\n   \n  About 200 additional National Guard troops will be deployed in Memphis over the next few days, the Memphis Police Department told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/sport/football-ncaa-south-carolina-trooper-altercation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"17:33:00Z","title":"Texas state trooper 'sent home' after altercation with South Carolina wide receiver Nyck Harbor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Texas Department of Public Safety trooper was removed from duty after allegedly bumping and shoving South Carolina football players Nyck Harbor and Oscar Adaway III during a game against Texas A&M.

Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A strong Pacific storm is bringing soaking rain to Southern California, increasing the risk of life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders are in effect for “vulnerable properties” within the Palisades, Hurst and Sunset burn scars, according to a Friday news release from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n \n\n   \n  The threat is tied to a multiday storm that began Thursday in northern and central California. More than a month’s worth of rain fell Saturday in many locations, with more still to come.\n \n\n   \n  November marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  As the storm drenched the region Friday, a 71-year-old man died after his car was pushed off a flooded bridge in the Sacramento Valley and a father  died  trying to save his 5-year-old daughter from 20-foot waves at a state park beach along the central coast.\n \n\n   \n  The flood threat has intensified as an  atmospheric river  feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall amounts up to 1.5 inches have been widespread in the Los Angeles area since early Saturday, with totals surpassing 2 inches farther northeast into Ventura County.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles and Long Beach are among several Southern California cities that have recorded more rain on Saturday than is typical for all of November. Oxnard saw 1.56 inches, up from an average of 0.71 inches in November.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles has picked up 2.75 inches of rain since the earliest hours of Friday morning, which is more than three Novembers’ worth of rain in under 48 hours.\n \n\n   \n  This second round of rain has the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through Saturday evening. The National Weather Service warns the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads.\n \n\n   \n    Burn scar areas on alert\n \n\n   \n  Areas burned by recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows.\n \n\n   \n  Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders in effect through   Sunday morning cover parts of the Palisades, Hurst and Sunset burn scars, but those are not the only areas at risk of dangerous debris flows.\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the Eaton and Bridge burn scars also have a high threat of “significant” debris flows, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest rain is expected to ease late Saturday, but the region isn’t in the clear. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won’t take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/michelle-obama-woman-president-not-ready","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"14:55:00-05:00","title":"Michelle Obama says the country is ‘not ready for a woman’ president","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michelle Obama, in a public conversation in Brooklyn, New York, stated that the United States is not ready for a woman president, citing the recent electoral loss of Kamala Harris as evidence.

Saturday signed a framework agreement for a peace deal, the latest step in the  so far unsuccessful efforts  to end the decades-long conflict in eastern Congo.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, M23 seized Goma and Bukavu, two key cities in eastern Congo, in a major escalation of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Backed by  neighboring Rwanda,  M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups fighting for control in Congo’s  mineral-rich  east. With 7 million people displaced, the conflict in Congo has been described by the United Nations as “one of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth.”\n \n\n   \n  The agreement signed in Doha on Saturday, following mediation by  Qatar  and the United States, is not yet a final peace agreement, but rather a framework outlining the measures required to reach one, the head of the M23 delegation, Benjamin Mbonimpa, said in a video posted on X.\n \n\n   \n  “There will be neither any change in the situation on the ground, nor any activity whatsoever, until the measures are debated, negotiated and discussed one by one and a final peace agreement is reached,” Mbonimpa said.\n \n\n   \n  The Congolese government said in a statement the framework agreement signed on Saturday includes eight measures that serve as a basis for a peace deal. Two of the measures — agreements on the release of prisoners and the creation of a ceasefire oversight body — were already signed in September and October.\n \n\n   \n  The six other measures, which in part include the restoration of state authority in rebel-controlled areas, humanitarian access, and the resettlement of refugees, will be subject to discussion and negotiation in the next two weeks, the Congolese government said.\n \n\n   \n  Qatar has hosted multiple rounds of talks since April between the Congo and M23, mainly to set preconditions for a peace deal and agree on confidence-building steps, but both sides still accuse each other of violating peace terms and fighting has continued.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Congo and M23 signed a signed a declaration of principles in Qatar to end the conflict and commit to a comprehensive peace agreement. They agreed to finalize the deal by Aug. 18 but missed the deadline, blaming each other for breaches of the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Massad Boulos, senior adviser to  US President Donald Trump , attended the ceremony in Doha on Saturday and called the framework agreement a “starting point.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is only the beginning, but we know the final outcome will be very fruitful,” he said, calling it a “historic” opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also led mediation efforts between Rwanda — which is accused of backing M23 — and Congo, leading to the signing of a peace deal between the two countries in June.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/visitors-flock-to-national-zoo-reopening","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:25:00Z","title":"Smithsonian Museums and National Zoo Reopenings Bring Flocks of Visitors","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a three-week closure due to a government shutdown, the Smithsonian Institution, including its 17 museums and the National Zoo, has begun a phased reopening on November 15, 2025.

and far-right politicians battle for Chile’s presidency in election dominated by crime and immigration \n       \n  By Michael Rios, Cristopher Ulloa, Mauricio Torres, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:51 PM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Chile  faces a stark range of candidates in Sunday’s presidential election where the frontrunners include a longtime Communist Party member and two ultraconservatives.\n \n\n   \n  As the  country  grapples with growing crime rates, surging immigration and discontent with the policies of the leftist President Gabriel Boric, some analysts expect voters to choose a different direction for the South American nation. But just how   different remains unclear.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at who’s running and their campaign pledges.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the candidates?\n \n\n   \n  On the ballot are eight candidates with at least three frontrunners including José Antonio Kast, an ultraconservative politician who has promised to make Chile great again; Johannes Kaiser, a libertarian who is considered even more radical than Kast; and Jeannette Jara, a longtime Communist Party member who has been distancing herself from the leftist government.\n \n\n   \n  Leading the polls is Jara, a 51-year-old Communist Party member and former labor minister under the leftist Boric administration.\n \n\n   \n  Despite being the only candidate for Chile’s left-wing coalition, she doesn’t have an uncontested path to the presidency. Her ties to the unpopular Boric administration have weighed her down, so much so that she has been gradually distancing herself from her own party – even hinting that she might suspend her Communist Party membership if elected president.\n \n\n   \n  She’s running on a promise to drive development through domestic production, protect workers’ rights, and raise the minimum wage. She has also acknowledged the country’s security concerns, saying it ought to build more jails, boost law enforcement numbers, and secure its borders with more advanced technology.\n \n\n   \n  Her closest rival, according to most polls, is Kast, a far-right politician often compared by analysts to Donald Trump. Many of his policies mirror those of the US president, including his proposal to close the borders and remove some 300,000 people who entered Chile irregularly.\n \n\n   \n  Kast has always opposed abortion rights, same-sex marriage and immigration, and in a previous presidential run, he proposed digging trenches in several parts of the northern border to prevent irregular immigration.\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, the Associated Press (AP)  reported  that his German-born father had been a member of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party, but that issue has not come up much during this race. Kast has repeatedly denied that his father was a supporter of the Nazi party, describing him instead  as a forced conscript  in the German army. CNN has reached out to his party for comment on AP’s reporting.\n \n\n   \n  Kast founded Chile’s Republican Party in 2019 and is widely credited for bringing extreme right positions to the national stage. But in the final weeks of campaigning, another ultraconservative emerged – one that some consider more radical than Kast.\n \n\n   \n  Kaiser, a YouTuber turned politician, gained traction in the final months of the election with his hardline proposals which include a free market economy, austerity measures and tougher penalties for criminals.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent interview with  Agence France-Presse , the far-right politician proposed sending immigrants with criminal records to El Salvador’s notorious prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as Cecot.\n \n\n   \n  Dissatisfied with Chile’s Republican Party, Kaiser and four other deputies founded in 2024 a new right-wing party linked to libertarian ideas.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with CNN Chile in February 2024, Kaiser said his presidential campaign is further to the right than that of Kast, declaring, “to my right is Genghis Khan.”\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake?\n \n\n   \n  Insecurity is arguably the biggest issue in the South American country, where the number of victims of crimes has been steadily increasing since 2021, according to the National Institute of Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that in the elections in Chile, as in many Latin American countries, the issue of security is central, without a doubt: the fight against organized crime, against criminal gangs, all these laments of a society that feels held hostage by the high levels of drug trafficking and other activities,” Luz Araceli González, professor of International Relations at Tecnológico de Monterrey, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  All candidates have promised to get tougher on crime, but so far it remains to be seen whose proposals resonate most with voters.\n \n\n   \n  If no candidate obtains more than half of the votes on Sunday, the two frontrunners will go to a runoff election on December 14, according to Chilean law.\n \n\n   \n  Jara is the favorite to win the first round by a narrow margin, but even if she moves on to the runoff, she’s expected to face a much tougher challenge against what could be a more unified right.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an electorate that doesn’t identify with either the left or the right, or with the degrees of polarization between them, but rather seeks solutions and answers, and those answers today are on the right,” said political analyst Guillermo Holzmann. “It is the most extreme right wing that is now being validated, that is not only considered sensible, but also reasonable and electable.”\n \n\n   \n  Holzmann argues that Kast’s chances in this election are greater than his previous runs due to issues the Boric administration has failed to resolve, such as the growing sense of insecurity and the fight against organized crime.\n \n\n   \n  “Chile enters these elections with a degree of uncertainty,” he said. “Although we’ve been expecting a presidential runoff for months, and it’s clear there will be a shift in ideological orientation in the next government.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/business/federal-reserve-kugler-trading","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:01:00Z","title":"Former Fed official Adriana Kugler violated trading rules, disclosure report shows","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler violated the central bank’s blackout trading rules by purchasing and trading stocks, including Apple, Caterpillar, and Palo Alto Networks, during a prohibited period ahead of a July 2024 FOMC meeting.

rules, disclosure report shows \n       \n  By Gordon Ebanks, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:01 PM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dr. Adriana Kugler, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors who abruptly announced her resignation in August, broke the central bank’s trading rules, according to a  report released  Saturday by the US Office of Government Ethics.\n \n\n   \n  That disclosure shows violations of purchasing stocks and making those trades in 2024 during a “blackout period,” which is ahead of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings when officials are prohibited from trading securities.\n \n\n   \n  An official from the Federal Reserve told CNN that the ethics report Kugler filed had detailed financial transactions that explicitly violated the central bank’s policy. In advance of July’s FOMC meeting, which Kugler did not attend, she requested a waiver from the Fed’s “blackout trading restrictions” — intended to ensure Federal Reserve officials don’t profit off of monetary policy decisions that can have large impacts on stock performance — to address “impermissible holdings.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell denied the waiver, and Kugler resigned.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, Kugler had been given training after another issue led Fed ethics officials to refer her to the Office of the Inspector General, the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the OIG told CNN that it has opened an investigation into the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed announced new trading rules in October 2021 following a controversy over trades made by senior officials. The rules banned policymakers and senior staff from buying individual stocks and bonds and restricted active trading. The Fed also sought to increase the frequency of reporting and public disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the stocks that Kugler invested in include Apple ( AAPL ), Caterpillar ( CAT ) and Palo Alto Networks ( PANW ).\n \n\n   \n  Kugler signed the public financial disclosure report on September 11, 2025. The report also notes, “Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler’s spouse, without Dr. Kugler’s knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.”\n \n\n   \n  Kugler has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Kugler was appointed by then-President Joe Biden in 2023. She previously served in the Obama administration as the chief economist to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and is a professor at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed did not cite a reason for Kugler’s departure when she announced her resignation on August 1. Her term as Federal Reserve governor was slated to end on January 31, 2026.\n \n\n   \n  After Kugler announced her exit, President Donald Trump said he was “very happy” about having an open spot on the Fed Board. Trump filled the seat by tapping Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers. Miran has participated in two Fed meetings and  broken ranks  with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts released a statement Saturday calling for stronger ethics rules to prevent Fed officials from improper trading.\n \n\n   \n  “Independence does not mean impunity, and Congress needs to pass bipartisan legislation to make the Fed more transparent and accountable,” said Warren, who is a ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. “The American people should be able to trust that the Fed’s decisions are driven by the best interests of the American people, and not the personal interests of individual officials or the political interests of Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, called for reforms of the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time the Federal Reserve faces an ethics scandal, it chips away at Americans’ confidence in one of our most important institutions. The latest report makes clear that the Fed still doesn’t have the guardrails or culture of accountability the American people expect,” Scott said in a statement. “The next Fed Chair must restore integrity, strengthen transparency, and end the pattern of insiders playing by their own rules. Reform isn’t optional, it’s essential if the Fed is going to fully regain the trust it has lost.”\n \n\n   \n   This is story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-new-january-6-pardons","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"14:48:00-05:00","title":"Trump issues new pardons for January 6 rioters, including militia member and woman who threatened FBI","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has issued new pardons to two individuals linked to the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot: Dan Wilson, a militia member with prior firearms offenses in Kentucky, and Suzanne Kaye, who threatened to shoot FBI agents in a 2021 social media post.

      \nUpdated: \n        1:02 PM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President  Donald Trump  announced Friday he is officially rescinding his endorsement of Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene  and attacked her in personal terms, while the congresswoman countered that Trump was trying to make an example of her to prevent the release of files on  convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .\n \n\n   \n  The president’s post marked a major political breakup  weeks in the making  – a dramatic intensification of a simmering  back-and-forth between the two former allies , who grew apart as Greene criticized Trump on a number of fronts. It spilled into a messy exchange of blows as the controversy around Epstein again took center stage in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene,” Trump said in a  post  to social media, adding that Greene, who is running for reelection in 2026, has “gone Far Left.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene has publicly warned in recent weeks that Trump has been too focused on foreign policy and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home – taking her message to outlets like CNN and  ABC’s “The View.”  Greene, who arrived in Congress in 2021, has until recently been an ardent and outspoken Trump supporter.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican responded to Trump in a  social media post  Friday, writing, “Of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  She added on Saturday that she is facing threats against her, which she said Trump “fueled and egged on.”\n \n\n   \n  “I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected,” Greene wrote  on X .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Friday, Trump defended his efforts to engage with foreign leaders and travel abroad amid Greene’s criticism, suggesting that his relationships on the world stage have benefited her district and expressing openness to endorsing a potential primary challenger.\n \n\n   \n  “Marjorie Taylor Greene said, ‘Oh, gee, I’m spending too much time overseas. So let’s say I don’t meet with China. You know what’s happened right now to Georgia? To every other state?” Trump said aboard Air Force One.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “They’re not working because your magnets and your rare earths would’ve kicked in, and there wouldn’t have been a factory in the world working if I didn’t have a relationship overseas with China.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that he is in the United States “95, 98% of the time.”\n \n\n   \n  “The last thing I want to do is travel 22 hours in an airplane, as nice as this plane is,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump warned that Greene has “changed” politically in recent weeks as the Georgia congresswoman has publicly lambasted the White House’s messaging on the government shutdown and Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that her constituents aren’t going to be happy. Already, I have people calling me. They want to challenge her to a race in her district in Georgia,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  He also said he was open to endorsing a rival GOP candidate in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  Greene is one of four House Republicans who signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on release of Justice Department documents pertaining to the Epstein case, but CNN has reported that the number of House Republicans who could break from Trump and vote for the files’ release could be greater. Trump has repeatedly and emphatically described calls for transparency around his ties to Epstein as a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  But Greene’s message has also extended more broadly to target Trump’s economic policies, suggesting that the White House needs to improve its messaging on affordability issues.\n \n\n   \n  Greene fired back in her social media post on Friday with a pair of screenshots of text messages that appeared to be sent to Trump and his aide Natalie Harp.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans, she wrote, “wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.”\n \n\n   \n  In a message to a contact in her phone labeled “DJT,” Greene encouraged Trump to “lean into” Epstein’s ties to other high-profile figures and what she described as the “deep state.” In a separate message to Harp, she voiced her support for Trump but said the White House must “stop ignoring the women. … Them being raped as teenagers is not a hoax.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with comments from Rep.

Ukraine struck a key oil terminal in the Russian port city of Novorossiysk overnight, causing infrastructure damage and igniting a blaze, as deadly overnight Russian strikes pounded Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  The depot, one of Russia’s largest oil export facilities, was targeted by Ukrainian forces in an attack acknowledged by officials from both countries that highlights Kyiv’s escalating efforts to target a key source of war revenue for Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian General Staff said damage was caused to “valuable” infrastructure at the port and oil terminal, as well as a launcher from Russia’s S400 air defense system.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian weapons were used in the attack on Novorossiysk, including long-range Neptune missiles and various types of strike UAVs, the General Staff said. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had launched the domestically produced long-range Neptune cruise missiles at Russian targets, without specifying where.\n \n\n   \n  “This is our entirely justified response to the ongoing Russian terror,” Zelensky said in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said this week that Ukraine was “increasing the effectiveness” of the use of domestic long-range weapons, including Neptune and Flamingo missiles, as well as jet drones.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, a source within the Security Service of Ukraine said forces struck the “second-largest oil export center in Russia,” damaging oil tankers, pipeline infrastructure and pumping stations.\n \n\n   \n  The operation ignited a “major” fire at the facility, which remained burning on Friday morning, according to the source, who added that anti-aircraft missile systems were also hit.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratiev, confirmed the attack on the oil depot in Novorossiysk, claiming that fragments of downed Ukrainian drones had hit the oil depot.\n \n\n   \n  According to Kondratiev, at least four people were wounded as a result of Ukraine’s attack on the port city, adding that at least four apartment buildings and two private homes had been damaged. A state of emergency has been declared there, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Russia’s defense ministry said it had intercepted a total of 216 Ukrainian drones overnight.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, residents of Kyiv experienced another heavy night of Russian aerial attacks. The Russian strikes on Ukraine’s capital killed at least seven people and injured dozens more, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  A married couple, aged 71 and 73, were among those killed, Kyiv police said.\n \n\n   \n  Also killed was the widow of the first victim of the Chernobyl disaster, according to the  Ukrainian agency  that manages the ruins of the nuclear power plant. In a post on Facebook, the agency said 73-year old Natalia Khodemchuk died from burns sustained during a Russian strike on her apartment building. Her husband, Valeriy, was a senior operator of the main circulation pump when an explosion tore through Chernobyl’s No. 4 reactor on April 26, 1986, causing the world’s worst nuclear accident.\n \n\n   \n  Two more people were killed in a Russian attack on the Black Sea city of Chornomorsk on Friday morning, according to the head of the Odesa regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n    Foiled assassination plot\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Russia’s security service has claimed it foiled a plot by Ukraine to assassinate a high-ranking Kremlin official inside Russia as the alleged target visited a graveyard.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian special services were planning to target the unnamed man, described as “one of the highest-ranking officials of the Russian state,” while he was visiting the graves of his relatives at a cemetery outside Moscow, according to a Friday statement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n \n\n   \n  The FSB also claimed in its statement that Ukraine is planning similar attacks inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  CNN could not independently verify Russia’s claims. The Security Service of Ukraine denied the report, telling CNN, “They are churning out fake news and statements non-stop. Our position is not to comment on their nonsense.”\n \n\n   \n  Assassinations have become a hallmark of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Targeted killings inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine have surged since 2022,  according to  monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED).\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has also seen assassinations.

the use of drones by both the Russians and Ukrainians, both sides have also managed to turn the mist to their advantage.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Russian forces exploited the low visibility to build a pontoon across the Vovcha river in the south of Ukraine, according to the unofficial DeepState website, which monitors battlefield developments in the country.\n \n\n   \n  They managed to get at least 10 vehicles across, which then dispersed in the village of Dachne, according to DeepState.\n \n\n   \n  “The fog is very thick, and enemy forces continue to accumulate,” said one Ukrainian soldier, Stanislav Buniatov, on Telegram.\n \n\n   \n  In Ukraine’s Donetsk region, fog has hampered drone operations for both sides in the  hotly contested town of Pokrovsk  and added an element of randomness to the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “Donbas fog.

Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:18 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands in Congress as a non-voting delegate, exchanged texts with convicted sex offender  Jeffrey Epstein  during a 2019 congressional hearing, the delegate’s office confirmed to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “During the hearing, Congresswoman Plaskett received texts from staff, constituents and the public at large offering advice, support and in some cases partisan vitriol, including from Epstein,” Plaskett’s spokesperson, Angeline Jabbar, said in a statement to CNN. “As a former prosecutor she welcomes information that helps her get at the truth and took on the GOP that was trying to bury the truth. The congresswoman has previously made clear her long record combating sexual assault and human trafficking, her disgust over Epstein’s deviant behavior and her support for his victims.”\n \n\n   \n  The texts,  first reported by the Washington Post , were released Wednesday as part of  roughly 20,000 pages of documents made public  by the House Oversight Committee.\n \n\n   \n  The released text messages redact the name of the person Epstein was texting with on February 27, 2019 — the day former Trump personal   attorney  Michael Cohen  testified to the House Oversight Committee about the president’s conflicts of interests, business practices and payments to Trump’s alleged mistresses to silence their stories before the 2016 elections.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post analyzed the text messages and compared them to footage of the hearing to report Plaskett was texting Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Epstein had already been convicted of two state prostitution charges, which he served 13 months for. A few months after the text exchange took place, he would be  charged with sex trafficking minors .\n \n\n   \n  Epstein had ties to the US territory because he  maintained a home  on Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, which he acquired in 1998, and purchased nearby Great St. James in 2016, according to a lawsuit filed in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  According to the Post, Epstein seemed to have been watching the hearing and his texts to Plaskett appeared to influence what the delegate asked Cohen.\n \n\n   \n  In one exchange, Epstein texted Plaskett: “Cohen brought up RONA - keeper of the secrets,” referring to — and misspelling the first name of — Rhona Graff, a longtime Trump assistant.\n \n\n   \n  Plaskett responded: “RONA??” She added at 2:25 p.m, “Quick I’m up next is that an acronym,” suggesting that she would be questioning Cohen soon.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein responded: “Thats his assistant.”\n \n\n   \n  At 2:28 p.m., Plaskett began questioning Cohen and asked about Graff, along with other Trump associates he had mentioned, according to the Post.\n \n\n   \n  In another text, Epstein told Plaskett “Good work” at 2:34 p.m. — a minute after Plaskett wrapped up her questioning, the Post reported.\n \n\n   \n  The trove of documents released earlier this week show that  Epstein mentioned President Donald Trump  multiple times in private emails. The release came amid renewed pressure on Congress and the Trump administration to release more documents related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The House is expected to  vote on a bill next week compelling the release  of all of the Justice Department’s Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile,  Trump directed the Justice Department  on Friday to investigate Epstein’s ties to a slew of high-profile figures, including former President Bill Clinton.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/europe/leo-hollywood-vatican-cinema-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-11:04","title":"Cate Blanchett and Spike Lee join Pope Leo as he hosts star-packed Vatican meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, hosted a star-studded meeting at the Vatican with prominent film personalities including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee, Monica Bellucci, Adam Scott, and Sergio Castellitto.

Parker, a Tonawanda Seneca from western New York, never took no for an answer.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the Civil War, Parker’s offer to enlist was rejected outright by another New Yorker, Secretary of State William H. Seward, who – according to historians – told the Seneca leader the war dividing America “was an affair between white men and one in which the Indian was not called on to act.”\n \n\n   \n  “Go home, cultivate your farm, and we will settle our own troubles among ourselves without any Indian aid,” Seward told Parker, who also unsuccessfully petitioned Congress to grant him US citizenship so he could enlist. Native Americans would not be made citizens until 1924.\n \n\n   \n  But Parker had connections: He was a close friend of future Union Army Commander Ulysses S. Grant, who eventually intervened and endorsed his commission as captain. He would become a top aide to the Union Army’s most revered general.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, in a ceremonial courtroom in downtown Buffalo, supporters and direct descendants of Parker gathered for a celebration of his resiliency, with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, Fourth Department posthumously admitting him to the bar – 176 years after he had been denied because Native Americans were not considered US citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “The posthumous admission to the bar is fitting and deserving of a man who lived his life with integrity,” said C. Joseph Genetin-Pilawa, an associate professor of history at George Mason University who has written extensively about Parker. “He didn’t give up. He continued to fight for what he believed in.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the first Native American posthumously admitted to the bar in US history, according to legal experts. The petition for admission was made on behalf of his great-great-great-grandniece,  Melissa Parker Leonard , whose father, Alvin, often played the chief in historical reenactments. The effort dates to 2020, when former Texas appellate Justice John Browning, a law professor at Faulkner University, first approached Alvin Parker, who died in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite all the odds, all the adversity, the Seneca people still reside in western New York,” Parker Leonard, a 42-year-old educator and vice president of The Buffalo History Museum, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s recognition not only for Ely, but for anyone who had a role in keeping us here … I really believe my relatives back then, 200 years ago, were desperately trying to maintain their land because they were thinking of us and the generations to come.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Weight of his community was on his shoulders’\n \n\n   \n  At the Erie County Court Building on Friday, the bar admission ceremony opened with a  recitation of the Thanksgiving address  – an invocation within Indigenous Haudenosaunee communities that gives thanks to the earth and its abundance.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, the day has come,” said Justice Gerald Whalen, presiding judge of the appellate division, calling the moment “the last steps on the long road to correcting a historic injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  “Despite his exclusion, Ely Parker served his community, his nation and this country in a manner that will serve as an inspiration to generations to come,” Whalen said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker was born in 1828 on the Tonawanda Seneca Reservation in New York. His birth name was Ha-sa-no-an-da, which means “Leading Name,” according to the bar admission petition and other biographical information. During his formative years, in 1838, their ancestral land was taken from the Senecas through a treaty historians have called fraudulent.\n \n\n   \n  He studied at a Baptist mission school, where he adopted the name of a minister named “Ely.” The petition said Parker excelled in debate and oratory in White schools. He learned to defend himself in more ways than one.\n \n\n   \n  “Once or twice I have been severely abused,” he once wrote in a letter to a friend, according to the  Historical Society of the New York Courts . “But I returned blow for blow with savage ferocity. Whether I gained the upper hand of my antagonist I leave the public to decide. For mind you, these quarrels were public. Bad business, but it could not be helped.”\n \n\n   \n  He was just a teen, the petition said, when Parker began using his mastery of English to serve as “translator, scribe, and interpreter” during meetings in Washington between government officials and Tonawanda Seneca leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “He wrote letters back home and it’s clear that this was very emotionally draining,” Genetin-Pilawa told CNN. “It was taxing on him. I think that he felt like a lot of pressure from his community, like the weight of his community was on his shoulders.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s law studies started when he was 18 with a law firm in Ellicottville, a village south of Buffalo. With no formal licensing requirements at the time, most lawyers received their training “reading the law,” preparing arguments and sitting in on proceedings, according to the petition – which said Parker was “well-educated and steeped in the law” by the age of 21.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Parker was denied bar admission. New York’s highest court had “ruled that only natural-born or naturalized citizens could be admitted to practice and, as a Seneca, he was neither,” according to the  Historical Society of the New York Courts .\n \n\n   \n    ‘His best changed the course of our history’\n \n\n   \n  Parker instead turned to studying civil engineering, which led to work on projects such as the Erie Canal and the construction of a customs house and post office in Illinois, where he befriended Grant, according to historians. But he continued to use his legal training to serve the Seneca people, embarking with another lawyer on a 20-year battle to win the Tonawanda Seneca ancestral lands, the petition said. The effort secured two “rare victories for Native American rights in the High Court.”\n \n\n   \n  During Friday’s bar admission ceremony, one speaker lamented Parker is largely remembered for his role as a top aide to Grant during and after the Civil War. He was part of Grant’s inner circle and was present at Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox. He is credited with drafting the articles of surrender.\n \n\n   \n  “After today, Ely’s legacy will no longer appear as a mere footnote in the story of Ulysses S. Grant,” said Lee Redeye, a Seneca attorney and deputy counsel for the Seneca Nation of Indians, who, along with Browning, filed the petition for Parker’s admission. “From this moment forward, Ely’s life will stand tall on its own merits, an example for all native people aspiring to do great things.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “I wish that I could declare that the battles Ely fought in his lifetime are relics of the past, but even now, in this so-called modern age, Indigenous people face a relentless onslaught from external forces determined to erase our way of life.”\n \n\n   \n  When Grant was elected president, Parker became the first Native American appointed to the post of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, according to the petition. He experienced financial troubles later in life and worked as a clerk with the New York City Police Department until the time of his death in 1895.\n \n\n   \n  Ely Parker’s posthumous admission is the eighth in US legal history, according to Browning. Previous cases involved Asian American and Black American aspiring attorneys from the 19th and early 20th centuries who were also denied admission due to the color of their skin.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is deeply personal for our family. It allows Ely to rest in the knowledge that he did his best and that his best changed the course of our history,” Parker Leonard said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/middleeast/iran-seize-tanker-singapore-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:18:00-05:00","title":"Iran confirms seizure of tanker carrying petrochemical cargo","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have seized a Marshall Islands-flagged tanker, the Talara, in Gulf waters, claiming it was carrying unauthorized petrochemical cargo—specifically high-sulfur gasoil—from Sharjah, UAE, en route to Singapore.

During her interview this summer with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Maxwell did not implicate anyone in sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Geoffrey Berman, who was US attorney for SDNY when it brought charges against Epstein, told CNN’s Jake Tapper in 2022, “The Southern District of New York doesn’t pull punches. And I can assure you if there was a chargeable case against anybody else it would have been brought,” He added, “If the Southern District didn’t bring a case there was no case to be brought.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors also had  sought  to interview Epstein’s long-time friend Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former British prince, who had been accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexual assault, but were rebuffed by his lawyers. The former prince denied any involvement but settled with Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  Clayton, a former partner at New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell who has served on several corporate boards, was selected by Trump earlier this year to lead the office. While the Senate did not advance his nomination, in August, the district judges  voted  for him to serve in the role.  His relationship with Trump dates back several years — they’ve golfed together and Clayton served as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Since taking over SDNY, Clayton has kept a low profile. He assumed the position after the office weathered a public exodus of experienced prosecutors, including the interim US attorney after the Justice Department, who revolted when the Justice Department dropped criminal public corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n \n\n   \n  This summer, Clayton faced his first firestorm when the Justice Department officials in Washington  fired Maurene Comey, an experienced and well-liked prosecutor in the office and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Comey, who was one of the prosecutors who worked on the Epstein and Maxwell investigations, has sued the Justice Department over her termination. Clayton flew to Washington to try unsuccessfully to save her job, one person with knowledge of the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  At a securities regulation conference last week, Clayton used the forum to tout a case aligned with the Trump administration’s agenda, a take-down of drug dealers in New York’s Washington Square Park.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has struggled to tamp down the Epstein story. The House Oversight Committee released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate this week unleashing a wave of headlines. Some Republicans are expected to break ranks and vote next week for a bill calling for the Justice Department to release its Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, DOJ’s Blanche accused Epstein’s estate of hiding documents, which they called “inaccurate.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department hasn’t explained why it directed Clayton to open the investigation into those specific associates of Epstein and JPMorgan Chase.  In July, the FBI and Justice Department  issued a statement  saying they conducted a “systematic review” of the case files and “We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n \n\n   \n  By reopening the investigation, it could give DOJ grounds to stop the public release of its Epstein case files since they may now relate to an ongoing investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Former prosecutors say the statute of limitations has likely run out on any possible crimes other than sex trafficking of minors.  The latest trove of records, which included emails between Epstein and Summers and other emails that reference Trump and Clinton, did not suggest any of them were involved in criminal activity.\n \n\n   \n  Previously JPMorgan Chase was sued for ignoring red flags and continuing to bank with Epstein even as they filed suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department.  The bank terminated the relationship in 2013, several years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023 the bank paid $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein who alleged the financial institution turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions they allege enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. JPMorgan Chase also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase, said, “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks. We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/health/peptides-unregulated-influencers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-05:00","title":"The trend of unproven peptides is spreading through influencers and RFK Jr. allies","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The trend of injecting unproven peptides—such as BPC-157, TB-500, and CJC-1295—is spreading rapidly, fueled by celebrity influencers like Joe Rogan and political advocacy from Robert F.

Several peptides, such as BPC-157 and TB-500, are banned by international sports authorities as  doping substances .\n \n\n   \n  “None of them are proven,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a research methods expert and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute. “None of them have gone through what would be considered adequate clinical trials, but nonetheless many people are taking these. It’s actually quite extraordinary.”\n \n\n   \n  Those who’ve highlighted peptides’ benefits include  Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who has built a  national following  among Americans who are deeply skeptical of health experts, pharmaceutical companies and traditional medicine.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the  Food and Drug Administration  has been trying to crack down on the space, sending  warning letters  to clinics that promote the products and adding more than two dozen peptides to a list of ingredients that should not be made by specialty pharmacies that often custom mix the formulations.\n \n\n   \n  That approach may be coming to an end.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has vowed to end “FDA’s war” on peptides and other  alternative treatments  that are embraced by many in his  Make America Healthy Again  movement.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Kennedy’s friends and  associates  are among the biggest proponents, including self-described “biohacker” and “longevity expert” Gary Brecka, who sells peptide injectables, patches and nasal sprays through his website for $350 to $600 each.\n \n\n   \n  In a May appearance on Brecka’s podcast, Kennedy again promised to “end the war at FDA” on peptides,  stem cells ,  psychedelics  and other fringe therapies.\n \n\n   \n  “Music to my ears,” Brecka replied.\n \n\n   \n  Brecka declined to be interviewed for this story.\n \n\n   \n    Peptides are now part of the ‘circus’ of unproven wellness products\n \n\n   \n  Peptides are essentially the building blocks of more complex proteins. Inside the human body, peptides trigger hormones needed for growth, metabolism and healing.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA has approved a number of peptides as medications, including  insulin for diabetics  who don’t naturally produce it and human growth hormone for children with developmental disorders caused by low levels of the hormone.\n \n\n   \n  But many other peptides promoted online have never been approved, making them technically illegal to market as drugs. Under current FDA guidance these peptides also are ineligible for  compounding  — the process in which pharmacies mix made-to-order medications for patients.\n \n\n   \n  That hasn’t stopped celebrities and influencers from touting them.\n \n\n   \n   Joe Rogan , for example, has repeatedly praised BPC-157, a peptide derived from acids found in the gut.\n \n\n   \n  “I had tendonitis in my elbow, I started using BPC-157 and it was gone in two weeks,” Rogan told his podcast audience last year.\n \n\n   \n  He is among the celebrity clients listed on the website of Ways 2 Well, a Texas-based company that offers peptides,  stem cells ,  vitamin infusions  and other alternative treatments.\n \n\n   \n  It’s all part of “the circus of unproven, expensive and possibly dangerous” offerings promoted by  wellness and longevity clinics , said Topol, who has written about the industry.\n \n\n   \n  For $99, Ways 2 Well offers a “peptide consult” with a physician, after which the company ships the peptide vials along with a “full kit with dosing, instructions and syringes,” according to its website.\n \n\n   \n  Company founder Brigham Buhler is a former pharmaceutical sales rep. He did not respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Peptides are often pitched as a ‘natural’ alternative to modern medicine\n \n\n   \n  Andrea Steinbrenner, a consulting executive, said she became intrigued by peptides after hearing about their benefits for “longevity, repair, anti-aging and energy,” from an acquaintance who runs a clinic outside of San Diego.\n \n\n   \n  Steinbrenner and her husband now receive monthly infusions at the clinic, in addition to daily supplements.\n \n\n   \n  “I think peptides are popular right now because we are the aging generation and we are looking for alternatives to modern day medicine,” she said. “I absolutely believe in modern day, western medicine— it’s necessary. But there’s a lot of other things in the universe that the earth supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Peptide proponents often suggest their products are safe because they are based on substances found in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, peptides are naturally recognized by your body,” Brecka told his more than 2 million Instagram followers in February.\n \n\n   \n  Critics point out that the peptides for sale are often imperfect synthetics and are taken at doses much higher than any peptides in the body, raising the risk of allergic reactions and other harms.\n \n\n   \n  Brecka sells more than a half-dozen peptides, including ipamorelin and CJC-1295 — both of which the  FDA has flagged  for serious safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  Like other peptides sold on Brecka’s website, the ipamorelin vials carry the labeling: “research use only.”\n \n\n   \n    Research claims are often a ploy to dodge regulators\n \n\n   \n  The “research use” language is pervasive across the peptide space, even in forums where users trade tips for buying, dosing and “stacking” different drug combinations.\n \n\n   \n  One Facebook group instructs members what words to avoid: “instead of ‘taking’ you are ’researching’ peptides.”\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers who work in the field say the language is an attempt to skirt FDA regulations. The agency does not oversee chemicals that aren’t intended for human use.\n \n\n   \n  It’s often unclear whether such peptides are being produced in the U.S. by pharmacies and mislabeled for research, or whether they are being purchased from chemical manufacturers, many located in China and not subject to FDA drug quality standards.\n \n\n   \n  “Research-grade peptides are going to have junk in them,” said Paul Knoepfler, a cellular biologist at the University of California Davis. “They’re going to have chemicals used in the purification process and fragments of peptides that you don’t want.”\n \n\n   \n  On platforms like TikTok, companies in China and other countries offer to ship dozens of peptide varieties to the U.S. for as little as $5 a vial.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s actually in there?” Knoepfler said. “If someone injects it under their skin, what are they getting?”\n \n\n   \n    FDA has worked to restrict peptides for years\n \n\n   \n  During the  COVID-19 pandemic , the FDA issued over a half-dozen  warning letters  to businesses promoting peptides with “immune-boosting powers.”\n \n\n   \n  Then in 2023, the agency added nearly 20 peptides to a list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety risks. Pharmacies violating the measure risk fines, legal action or potential loss of their state licenses.\n \n\n   \n  That triggered pushback from wellness entrepreneurs and compounding pharmacies, including lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  One coalition, Save Peptides, warned its followers: “Our basic human rights to access alternative medical care using regenerative peptides is being stripped away by the FDA.”\n \n\n   \n  A lawsuit brought by a large compounding pharmacy alleged that regulators had skipped legally required steps when adding peptides to FDA’s list of high-risk substances. The litigation forced the agency to backtrack, and the FDA late last year agreed to convene two public meetings of outside advisers to review several peptides flagged for safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  In each case, the experts agreed with the FDA, voting that the substances were too risky to be compounded.\n \n\n   \n  Some in the industry disagree.\n \n\n   \n  “Physicians should have every available arrow in the quiver to treat illness and, because of the FDA’s inaction, they don’t,” said Lee Rosebush, who helped bring the lawsuit against FDA and represents a group of large compounding pharmacies.\n \n\n   \n    Changes may be coming\n \n\n   \n  The FDA, under Kennedy’s authority, recently removed a number of experts from the compounding advisory panel.\n \n\n   \n  That could pave the way for appointing more peptide-friendly experts who might vote to allow some of the drugs that the FDA previously barred. Alternately, the FDA could simply release a list of peptides and tell pharmacies and clinics that the agency won’t enforce bans against them.\n \n\n   \n  For now, doctors say they are fielding more questions from patients excited about peptides and seeking prescriptions.\n \n\n   \n  “Patients should be really asking their health care professionals: Are these medications safe long term?” says Dr. Anita Gupta of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who served on FDA’s compounding committee until earlier this year. “That’s the question I would ask if I was a patient.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/middleeast/ceasefire-gaza-israel-hamas-tunnels-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:34:00-04:00","title":"Weeks into the Gaza ceasefire, scores of Hamas fighters remain stuck in tunnels under Gaza","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Weeks after the October 10 ceasefire in Gaza, scores of Hamas militants remain trapped in tunnels beneath Rafah, with up to 200 fighters divided into isolated cells.

the  month-old ceasefire in Gaza. \n \n\n   \n  The issue of how to deal with up to 200 Hamas militants in Israeli-occupied territory in Gaza, is more than just a tactical problem for Israel’s military. It is a sensitive diplomatic matter with no clear way out.\n \n\n   \n  These cells – and it’s unclear exactly how many there are or their precise locations – have fortified themselves in these tunnels since the ceasefire divided Gaza along the so-called yellow line one month ago: Israel occupies territory east of the line while Hamas reasserts power west of it.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear he has no intention of simply letting the Hamas cells walk out of the tunnels and return to the Hamas-controlled part of Gaza. Hamas has said its militants will never turn themselves in and hand over their weapons.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is pushing Israel to make progress towards some sort of viable solution, according to two Israeli sources, and Trump’s son-in-law - US envoy Jared Kushner - brought up the issue with Netanyahu in meetings earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The Americans want to move ahead to the next phase and close the Rafah prisoners file,” one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The second phase of the ceasefire involves the creation of an international security force in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the further withdrawal of Israeli forces. Every element requires challenging negotiations with multiple countries, And the Hamas militants in Gaza are one more piece of an increasingly difficult diplomatic puzzle.\n \n\n   \n  One idea was to deport the militants to a third country, with Turkey considered a possible option, the other source said. But no such solution has materialized.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the week, Netanyahu’s office issued several denials regarding various reports about the release of what Israel sees as terror cells. “The prime minister did not commit to the Americans to release the prisoners from Rafah,” a senior Israeli official said in statement on Tuesday, adding a few hours later that “contrary to reports, no agreed-upon solution exists.”\n \n\n   \n  Without a resolution, the cells are a ticking time-bomb. With little or no access to food and water, the Hamas militants are left with a simple choice: surrender or fight. Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations,  previously told CNN  that “Hamas doesn’t even know how many are there that are still alive.”\n \n\n   \n  And the impasse has already proven a threat to the overall ceasefire that took effect on October 10.\n \n\n   \n  It is likely that these isolated cells – removed from Hamas command and control – were responsible for recent attacks on Israeli forces that prompted massive Israeli retaliation and twice threatened the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  On October 19, after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israel unleashed strikes that killed at least 44 Palestinians. Just over a week later, Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including dozens of children, after another Israeli soldier was killed in Rafah.\n \n\n   \n  In the current environment – with diplomacy stuck between the first and second phases of the ceasefire – neither Israel nor Hamas is budging.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Hamas’ military wing issued a statement saying that “there is no such term as surrounding or handing oneself over to the enemy.” The Al Qassam Brigades said, “We place the mediators before their responsibilities, and they must find a solution to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire.”\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of a solution, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have clashed with these Hamas cells underground. Twice within just a few hours on Wednesday, the IDF said its troops were operating to “dismantle underground infrastructure” when they identified “four terrorists” in areas occupied by Israel. In both cases, Israeli troops opened fire.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said the actions were in accordance with the US-brokered ceasefire agreement, which allows for the destruction of military and tunnel infrastructure in Gaza. But Hamas views them as a clear violation of the 20-point plan.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu has already come under pressure from Israel’s right-wing to refuse any agreement that will grant the militants safe passage to Hamas-controlled territory. On Tuesday, former Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said on X, “For the terrorists who murdered IDF soldiers after the ceasefire was declared, there must be only two options: surrender and imprisonment or death.”\n \n\n   \n  That political pressure limits Netanyahu’s realistic options for an acceptable solution,  knowing he will face criticism if he is perceived to be giving into Hamas’ demands.\n \n\n   \n  According to the US plan, the Hamas militants could be granted amnesty if they give up their weapons and commit to “peaceful co-existence.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of the underground militants is unlikely to derail the entire ceasefire effort on its own - and the US is investing tremendous effort and political capital in making sure the plan moves forward - but it is one more difficult roadblock for the mediators as they try to sustain the truce.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-latino-voters","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"Republicans have lost ground with Latino voters after Trump’s 2024 gains","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the year following Donald Trump’s re-election, Republican gains among Latino voters have eroded due to persistent economic discontent and declining approval of Trump’s second-term performance.

gains \n       \n  By Edward Wu, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A year after President Donald Trump’s re-election, Republicans are already seeing their gains among Latino voters erode, recent election results and polling suggest. Here’s what’s changed and what it could mean for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    Economic angst drove Latino voters toward the GOP in 2024\n \n\n   \n  Trump made  considerable inroads with Latino voters in 2024 , losing this group by just 5 points nationally after losing by 38 and 33 points in 2016 and 2020, respectively, according to CNN’s 2024 exit poll. Analyses by  Catalist  and the  Pew Research Center  also found a close race among Latinos last year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s relatively strong performance came amid a wave of economic discontent. CNN’s exit poll found that Latino voters were more likely than any other racial or ethnic group to select the economy as their top issue and to describe inflation as a severe or moderate hardship. They were the least likely to say their financial situation had improved since 2020.\n \n\n   \n    Latinos overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump’s second term so far\n \n\n   \n  Many Latinos entered Trump’s second term feeling optimistic. Over half approved of his handling of the presidential transition in a December 2024 CNN poll, a similar proportion described themselves as enthusiastic or optimistic about his second term, and 72% expressed at least some confidence in his ability to handle the economy.\n \n\n   \n  But in  CNN’s latest poll , just 20% of Latinos approved of his job performance, down from 41% in February. This 21-point drop far outpaces the 4- and 9-point drops among Black and White Americans and the 10-point drop in his approval rating overall.  Several   other   polls  have also found Trump’s approval rating among Latinos declining from the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  This drop in approval comes as Latinos continue to be focused on the economy: In the late October poll, 54% say the economy and cost of living is the nation’s top issue (compared to 47% for Americans overall) .  Latinos are more likely than Americans overall to rate economic conditions as somewhat or very poor (81%, compared to 72% of all Americans) and to say Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions (75%, compared to 61% of all Americans).\n \n\n   \n  Latinos are also likelier than the general population to say that immigration is extremely or very important to them (77% said so in CNN’s late summer poll, compared to 65% of Americans overall). From July to October, the proportion of Latinos who say that Trump has gone too far on deportations has gone up from 66% to 79%.\n \n\n   \n  Since March, the Republican Party’s favorability rating among Latinos has dropped from 26% to 16%, while the Democratic Party’s rating has mostly held steady, going from 37% to 34%. And by late summer, Latinos gave Democrats a 10-point advantage on economic issues, up from a near-even split in May.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump “received historic support from Latino voters in the 2024 election” and was beginning to fulfill his promises on the economy and immigration.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has consistently outperformed the mainstream media’s so-called polling, and he will continue doing so by delivering for everyday Americans,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats won Latinos in this month’s elections by wide margins\n \n\n   \n  In the first opportunity for millions of Americans to weigh in on Trump’s second term, Latinos supported Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey respectively, by at least a 2-to-1 margin, according to CNN’s exit poll. Latinos also voted for a Democratic-supported redistricting ballot measure in California 71% to 29%.\n \n\n   \n  There have been questions about Democrats’ ability to win back Latino voters given their own popularity issues. (CNN’s most recent polling found that more Latinos view the party unfavorably than favorably.)   The Latinos who voted in the November 2025 contests generally held favorable views of the Democratic Party – 56% in California and Virginia and 67% in New Jersey said they viewed the party favorably.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats were also better able than Republicans to win over Latino voters who viewed their respective parties negatively. Voters in California who viewed both parties negatively supported the Democratic-backed ballot measure 78% to 21%. In Virginia and New Jersey, just 2% of Latino voters who held a negative view of the Republican Party supported Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican gubernatorial candidates, while over a third who held a negative view of the Democratic Party across the two contests cast votes for the Democratic candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats’ strong performance among Latinos on November 4 was not solely the result of more Democratic-leaning Latino voters turning out. Mirroring the Latino disillusionment with Trump’s presidency, Latino Trump voters also appear to have defected from Trump at higher rates than the overall electorate.\n \n\n   \n  Among Latino voters who turned out in the November 2025 elections and said they had supported Trump last year, 24% in California voted for the Democratic-supported ballot measure and 18% in New Jersey supported Sherrill. The defection rates were considerably lower among all Trump voters who turned out in 2025: 12% in California supported the ballot measure and 7% in New Jersey voted for Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n    What this year’s results could mean for 2026\n \n\n   \n  While the 2025 contests represent a relatively narrow and Democratic-leaning playing field, early polling on the 2026 midterms also shows Democrats gaining ground. CNN’s October poll found that Latino registered voters say, 64% to 19%, that they’d prefer a Democratic congressional candidate over a Republican one. And 60% say there’s no chance they’d consider supporting a Republican candidate, while just 19% say they’ve ruled out backing a Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  An  October Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll  found a narrower but still substantial lead for Democrats among Latino voters – in that poll, 52% said they’d prefer a Democratic congressional candidate and 35% a Republican one.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s latest polling suggests that Democrats are currently holding onto more Latino voters who chose Democrat Kamala Harris last year than Republicans are holding onto Latino Trump voters. Among non-Latino voters, Democrats and Republicans are holding onto similar shares of their party’s voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/food/holiday-wine-tariffs-sales","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"Tariffs are coming for your holiday wine","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump’s administration, particularly a 15% duty on European Union wine imports, are driving up costs and reducing availability of imported wines in the U.S. This has led to a 13% year-over-year decline in wine sales and a 3% drop in consumption from 2019 to 2024, with projections of another 4% decline by 2029.

\nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Choosing the right wine to pair with your Thanksgiving meal can be as stressful as cooking the turkey. And this year, it’s going to be worse.\n \n\n   \n  Shoppers can expect higher prices and possibly slimmer selections at their local wine shops, as importers are facing steep tariffs and shopkeepers are dealing with declining demand.\n \n\n   \n  Bottled wine prices have risen nearly 20% over the past 25 years and 8% over the past decade, according to the latest government data.   Several reasons are to blame, including  climate change , inflation and rising production costs.\n \n\n   \n  Wine prices at  McCabes Wine & Spirits  shop in Manhattan are between 5% to 12% higher this year because “it’s the reality of the tariffs, shipping, manufacturing and labor,” said owner Daniel Mesznik.\n \n\n   \n  His shop, like others in the United States, are working to strike a delicate balance. They’re dealing with higher upfront costs due to a hodgepodge of tariffs from President Donald Trump’s administration — notably, a 15% tariff on European Union imports — while trying not to pass too any of those costs to their customers\n \n\n   \n  “We’re doing our best to keep those increases to a minimum for our guests,” he told CNN. “But, I think folks understand that this is the current reality and they’re receptive to it and they’re understanding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs are affecting the bottom line even more for importers of wine. Elenteny Imports, a logistics and distribution company that works with 9,000 retailers and restaurants, said wine sales are down 13% year over year.\n \n\n   \n    Wine woes\n \n\n   \n  Wine volume consumed   in the United States declined 3% between 2019 and 2024, and it’s expected to fall another 4% from 2024 to 2029, according to IWSR, an alcohol data insights firm.\n \n\n   \n  “For casual drinking occasions, wine has often been the choice for drinkers who prefer not to drink beer. But wine can be expensive and only comes in larger bottles,” said Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR.\n \n\n   \n  For the past few years, drinkers have been shifting their preferences to spirits and canned cocktails.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen wine volumes consistently decline year after year, while ready-to-drink beverages, which are less expensive, come in convenient sizes and packs, and benefit from continual flavor innovations, are growing rapidly,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  2025 is another gloomy year, according to data from Elenteny. Order volumes for imported wines show that year-to-date bookings are down nearly 30%.\n \n\n   \n  Demand has sunk following a “post-pandemic frothiness,” Elenteny CEO Alexi Cashen told CNN, but said “absolutely that tariffs are the persecutory issue here.”\n \n\n   \n   Domestic wines , which Trump thought the tariffs would help, aren’t selling any better this year, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Mesznik’s shop, which recently reopened following a 16-month renovation, has shifted some of its focus from wine to tequila.

This country just declared it a national security threat \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iceland’s relatively mild climate is shaped by a crucial network of currents that winds its away around the Atlantic Ocean transporting heat northward — without it, the island would be much icier and stormier. As evidence mounts these currents  could be on course for collapse , Iceland’s government has made the unusual move of designating the risk a national security threat, prompting a a high-level response into how to prepare for this “existential threat.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our climate, economy and security are deeply tied to the stability of the ocean currents around us,” said Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Iceland’s Minister for Environment, Energy and Climate.\n \n\n   \n  The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation — known as the AMOC — is a looping system of currents that works like a giant conveyor belt, pulling warm water from the Southern Hemisphere and tropics to the Northern Hemisphere, where it cools, sinks and flows back south.\n \n\n   \n  When scientists are asked which potential climate impact terrifies them most, the collapse of the AMOC is often top of the list.\n \n\n   \n  A growing body of research points to the AMOC slowing down, as higher global temperatures disrupt the delicate balance of heat and salinity on which its strength relies. The science is still unsettled on the likelihood and timing of any collapse, but some studies have projected it could be on course to happen  this century .\n \n\n   \n  A shutdown of the AMOC “cannot be considered a low likelihood risk anymore in view of the evolving science over the past years,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer and climatologist who has studied the AMOC at Potsdam University in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  The  impacts would be catastrophic  — ushering in huge global weather and climate shifts, including rising sea levels in parts of the US and Europe, disrupted monsoon systems affecting countries in Asia and Africa, and a winter deep freeze in Europe, with sea ice potentially creeping southward as far as the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  Iceland “would be close to the center of a serious regional cooling,” meaning the country could be surrounded by sea ice, Rahmstorf told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an “an existential threat,” Jóhannsson told CNN. The AMOC regulates Iceland’s weather, and its collapse could devastate infrastructure, transport and vital industries including fishing, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jóhannsson briefed the government on the latest science after  research  published in August raised “grave concerns” about the AMOC’s future stability. In September, Iceland’s National Security Council designated the current’s potential collapse as a national security risk, marking the first time a climate impact has received this designation in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The decision “reflects the seriousness of the issue and ensures that the matter gets the attention it deserves,” Jóhannsson said. In practice, the designation will mean a high-level, coordinated government response to understand the threat and work out how to prevent and mitigate the worst consequences, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rahmstorf commended Iceland for its decision and said other countries should follow suit. The impacts of an AMOC collapse would be felt across the globe. Scientists are trying to understand the full range of potential impacts on societies and economies, but research has pointed to  destroyed crops  and  catastrophic flooding .\n \n\n   \n  Iceland’s decision marks a shift in how the country understands climate risks, Jóhannsson said.\n \n\n   \n  “What we do know is that the current climate might change so drastically that it could become impossible for us to adapt,” he said. “In short, this is not just a scientific concern — it’s a matter of national survival and security.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/travel/travel-news-most-beautiful-village-france","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00+00:00","title":"France is the world’s favorite country to visit, but this is the village the French like best","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France remains the world’s most visited country, with 100 million international tourists in 2023, and has a deep cultural pride in its villages, food, and heritage.

another Italian town offering sweet deals to new residents, plus a medieval village in France that earns top scores from the French.\n \n\n   \n    France’s favorite village\n \n\n   \n  France has for some years been the  world’s most visited country , with a record 100 million international tourists going there last year to enjoy its culture, food and scenery. In 2022, a Belgian man even cycled 870 miles just to taste a  very special croissant  in Nice.\n \n\n   \n  But which destination in France is a favorite among the French? Earlier this year, viewers of the TV show  “Le Village Préféré des Français 2025”  chose Saint Antoine l’Abbaye as France’s favorite village for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  So what’s the appeal? This medieval village with cobbled streets and a stunning abbey is tucked away among green rolling hills between Grenoble and Lyon in the southeastern department of Isère. Vercors Regional Natural Park is on the village’s doorstep and the whole place bustles with performers, music, shows and stalls for the medieval festival held each year in the first week of August.\n \n\n   \n  The hanging cliffside houses of Pont-en-Royans are 14 miles away and the town of Saint-Marcellin, famous for its delicate creamy cheese, is just an eight-mile drive.\n \n\n   \n    The world’s best cheese and Germany’s best bread\n \n\n   \n  France is rightly celebrated for its cheeses, from Comté to Camembert, but it was an aged Swiss Gruyère that was anointed the finest on the planet at the World Cheese Awards in Switzerland on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Three cheeses on, we could still taste it,” was the conclusion of English judge Perry Wakeman, describing its “fruit-funk notes, some slight burn on there like charcoal.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 5,200 cheeses from 46 countries were gathered for the judging at Bern’s Festhalle venue, the pageant queens growing ever more pungent as the day wore on. CNN was there for all the  sights and smells .\n \n\n   \n  Moving from cheese to bread, the iconic French baguette has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as “250 grams of magic and perfection,” but all is not well in this world of flour and yeast. Even though UNESCO has deemed the baguette an essential cultural icon, France’s bread consumption is plummeting, with the daily trip to the boulangerie a disappearing way of life. Here’s how the  humble bread baton  is facing its uncertain future.\n \n\n   \n  France isn’t the only European country whose loaves have received UNESCO heritage status, however. German bread culture made the Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2015 and the country has more than 3,200 officially recognized types of bread. A nutty little number named Nussbrot was named Germany’s  bread of the year  for 2025.\n \n\n   \n    New life in the Old World\n \n\n   \n  Debra and Eric Stillwell, both in their 60s, relocated from Burbank, California, to  France’s Dordogne Valley  five years ago. The medieval towns, castles and landscapes were what lured them, Eric tells CNN.\n \n\n   \n  As retirees, they find the cost of living easier on their budget. “Everybody thinks that Americans living in France are all rich, and that’s not true,” says Eric. “Our house cost 70,000 euros… We aren’t rich.”\n \n\n   \n  Next door in Italy,   the picturesque village of Radicondoli, in Tuscany, has a relocation plan  offering up to $23,000  to anyone willing to buy and live in one of its vacant homes, along with   an extra roughly $7,000 in   contributions towards expenses like heating and transport.\n \n\n   \n    A seafood feast in Marseille\n \n\n   \n  Actor Tony Shalhoub is on a mission to find the world’s best, most surprising food items for under $10. That money nets him a seafood feast in the French port city of Marseille.

A Florida girl was last seen on a bus with her mom in June. Now the mom is in jail as police investigate her disappearance \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Gordon Terrelonge says it has been more than six months since he has seen or heard from his 10-year-old daughter, Gabrielle Terrelonge.\n \n\n   \n  He lost touch with Gabrielle and her mom, Passha Davis, this past spring after a dispute with Davis in Kissimmee, Florida, but said he expected his family would eventually reunite.\n \n\n   \n  However, when Terrelonge discovered in online jail records in late October that Davis had been arrested in the South Florida city of Margate, he contacted Margate police to ask who was caring for Gabrielle.\n \n\n   \n  It was then, Gordon Terrelonge says, that he and police learned at the same time: Gabrielle was missing.\n \n\n   \n  “My life has been hell,” Terrelonge told CNN this week. “This is the longest I’ve gone without seeing her.”\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle was not with Davis when the mom, after being accused of shoplifting, was arrested October 17, and Davis still was in a Broward County jail when Terrelonge called, police said. That call sparked an investigation by Florida police and  the FBI , who are  seeking the public’s help  in finding Gabrielle.\n \n\n   \n  As far as investigators know, the girl was last seen with Davis on June 30 taking a Greyhound bus from Broward County to Orlando, Margate police Maj. Al Banatte said. A witness on the bus saw them arrive at the Florida Mall, and “the manifest and tickets also corroborate this information,” Banatte said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis, who was re-arrested this month in connection with Gabrielle’s disappearance, told police she doesn’t know where her daughter is and “that she should be with her father,” according to the arrest affidavit. But Margate police say Terrelonge last saw Gabrielle in Kissimmee in April – when investigators believe Davis left that city with the child – and that Terrelonge is cooperating with the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle’s disappearance has left her family reeling and desperate for answers about her whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  “This is very devastating for me,” Gabrielle’s paternal grandmother, Jonett Vassel, told CNN over the phone as she hung flyers in Orlando with her granddaughter’s picture on them. “I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I’m fasting, I’m praying. I’m still trusting God, because I’m a Christian, so I’m trusting that he will bring her home.”\n \n\n   \n  Police and court records paint a picture of an unstable living situation for both Davis and Gabrielle since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Davis was homeless and suffered from “mental illness and substance abuse issues,” police said in her November arrest affidavit. Yet Gabrielle was in Davis’ care, and they moved from city to city in Florida last year and parts of this year, staying with family members, at hotels and even sleeping in a car, Margate police said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ October arrest came after she was accused of shoplifting at a Dollar Tree in Margate. The store declined to prosecute, but police arrested her on charges of resisting a police officer without violence and providing false identification while being lawfully detained, records show.\n \n\n   \n  She posted bail on October 31 but was re-arrested by Margate police on November 4 and charged with child neglect in Gabrielle’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Davis “failed to provide any reasonable explanation as to the whereabouts of her minor child” and “failed to provide adequate services and supervision necessary to maintain her physical and mental health,” police allege in a court document.\n \n\n   \n  During Davis’ November 5 bond hearing in the child neglect case, a defense attorney told a Broward County judge that Davis had told him “she is innocent of these charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “She’s wanting to fight these allegations,” the defense attorney said.\n \n\n   \n  Davis is represented by the Broward County public defender’s office, court records show, and CNN has sought comment from that office. Davis is being held at a county jail with bond set at $100,000.\n \n\n   \n  In an arraignment Monday relating to the first arrest, Davis told a judge she had mental illness. The judge ordered that Davis be evaluated for competency by November 26.\n \n\n   \n    A rocky living situation\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle was last enrolled in school in Port St. Lucie, Florida, when she and Davis lived with Gabrielle’s paternal aunt there from April 2024 to November 2024, Banatte said. Sometime after Thanksgiving last year, Davis and Gabrielle left the aunt’s house for a Motel 6, Margate police said.\n \n\n   \n  This March, they were found sleeping in a car in Broward County, Margate police said. The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) intervened and helped Davis and Gabrielle travel to Orlando, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DCF to inquire about the encounter, including why the agency helped them go to Orlando, whether DCF was aware of Gabrielle’s school enrollment status, and whether the state considered removing the child from Davis’ custody.\n \n\n   \n  Between mid-March and April, Davis and the child were with Gordon Terrelonge in the Orlando and Kissimmee areas, Margate police said. But after the April dispute in Kissimmee, Terrelonge said, he never saw Gabrielle again.\n \n\n   \n    A father’s desperate plea\n \n\n   \n  Terrelonge described Gabrielle as a joyful child who is adventurous and loves nature, coloring, wearing princess costumes and having tea parties.\n \n\n   \n  He said Gabrielle and Davis shared a close bond, and even when times were tough, Gabrielle preferred to be with her mother over anyone else.  Terrelonge said his attempts to get full legal custody of Gabrielle were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  He said he had lost touch with Davis and Gabrielle in the past, but they would always find their way back to each other within a few months.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always in and out,” Terrelonge said of Davis. “But I always end up finding them.”\n \n\n   \n  Terrelonge said he has followed all leads for possible places where Gabrielle could be. He said he wants to believe that Gabrielle is safe, but he worries that someone could have harmed her.\n \n\n   \n  “If anyone knows anything, please come forward and let us know,” Terrelonge said. “You may save my child’s life.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Taylor Galgano and Lily Hautau contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/uk/trump-bbc-apology-sue-billion-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:18:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he will sue the BBC despite broadcaster’s apology","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced plans to sue the BBC for between $1 billion and $5 billion over a controversial edit in a 2024 documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?', in which a portion of his speech from the January 6 Capitol attack was altered to suggest he said he would 'walk with them and fight like hell.'

Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:18 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump says he intends to sue the BBC for between $1 billion and $5 billion “probably sometime next week” despite the broadcaster’s apology to him over a documentary Trump’s lawyers described as defamatory.\n \n\n   \n  “I think I have to do it,” Trump told reporters. “They’ve even admitted that they cheated … They cheated, they changed the words coming out of my mouth.”\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the BBC  apologized to Trump  over an editing blunder in an October 2024 documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?,” saying that it “sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the BBC has rejected the defamation claim and is refusing to pay compensation. The controversy has sparked a crisis in the BBC, triggering the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to UK network GB News, Trump acknowledged the apology he received from the BBC, saying “they wrote me a nice letter.”\n \n\n   \n  “’We apologize,’ but when you say it’s unintentional, I guess if it’s unintentional, you don’t apologize,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The president told GB News he is not looking to get into lawsuits but painted the move as essential to prevent similar mishaps in the future.\n \n\n   \n  “This was so egregious,” he said, “If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people… I’d like to find out why they did it.”\n \n\n   \n    Plans to call the UK PM\n \n\n   \n  In the BBC’s edit, on an edition of the TV show Panorama, different parts of Trump’s speech from the day of the January 6 storming of the US Capitol were spliced together, creating the impression Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  He told GB News: “I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement.”\n \n\n   \n  The president said Friday he plans to call UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the coming days to discuss the spat with the BBC, claiming the prime minister is “very embarrassed” about the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Should Trump proceed with his case and win it would impose enormous financial burdens on the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is primarily license-fee funded, meaning anyone watching live television in the UK or who accesses BBC content online must pay a compulsory charge. The BBC’s income is further supplemented by commercial subsidiaries.\n \n\n   \n  According to the  BBC’s most recent operational report,  in the year ending March 2025 the BBC’s total income was £5.9 billion (more than $7.5 billion.) The license fee raised £3.8 billion (around $5 billion) - 65% of the BBC’s revenue in that year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump previously threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump said he wants the BBC to “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused, the UK’s strict limitations on defamation cases mean the president cannot take legal action in the courts of England and Wales, as the purported wrongdoing happened more than 12 months ago.\n \n\n   \n  If he wishes to pursue his claim, Trump’s only option is to do so in US courts. But this process will not be simple. In the US, the president will be expected to present a high standard of compelling evidence proving his reputation was materially damaged because of the BBC’s edit.\n \n\n   \n  Rebuking Trump’s demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n \n\n   \n  A letter from the BBC’s legal team summarizes the organization’s grounds to reject Trump’s defamation claim, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip was never meant to be considered in isolation.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Billy Stockwell and Laura Sharman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/justice-jackson-snap-fight","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Justice Jackson goes ‘her own way’ in Supreme Court’s SNAP fight","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-stakes emergency case during the government shutdown, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, despite her previous criticism of the Trump administration, granted a temporary administrative stay allowing President Trump to block a lower court order that would have funded SNAP benefits for 40 million Americans.

4:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As she oversaw President Donald Trump’s emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, case this past week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson once again proved she isn’t beholden to Supreme Court custom.\n \n\n   \n  The least senior justice, who has been the court’s most  consistent critic of the second Trump administration , appeared to be sending signals not only about the technicalities of the SNAP case but also more subtle messages about the way the court has handled a litany of short-fuse appeals on its emergency docket this year dealing with presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  She did all that, oddly enough,  by siding with Trump .\n \n\n   \n  “She’s modeling the way that the emergency docket should be used,” said Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.\n \n\n   \n  Since joining the court three years ago, Jackson has drawn attention for a sharp pen. That has been particularly notable   in   a series of cutting dissents she has written this year calling out the Trump administration for what she has framed as “ lawlessness .” And she has not spared her colleagues for acquiescing to the White House in some of those decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote in August when the court allowed the  Trump administration to halt about $800 million  in research grants. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”\n \n\n   \n  That pointed prose and her unflinching willingness to criticize her colleagues   has made Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by former President Joe Biden, a divisive figure.\n \n\n   \n  “Even before the SNAP case, Justice Jackson had already emerged as the most vocal, most frequent, and sharpest critic of the majority’s inconsistent, difficult-to-justify, and often unjustified behavior in Trump-related cases,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  Her machinations in the case, Vladeck said, underscored “a justice who is using every possible strategic and tactical maneuver behind the scenes to try to push the court toward what she believes the right answer is, but who is unafraid of sending increasingly loud public signals when those efforts are, as they so often have been this year, ultimately for naught.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal on funding for SNAP emerged as the highest-profile legal case of the government shutdown. A lower court  ordered the US Department of Agriculture  to transfer $4 billion from another fund to pay full SNAP benefits for November – an order that the administration appealed as an overreach of judicial power.\n \n\n   \n  With a midnight deadline approaching – and benefits for more than 40 million Americans hanging in the balance – the case landed in a rush at the Supreme Court on a Friday evening. Trump wanted the justices to temporarily block the lower court order, known as a “stay.”\n \n\n   \n  Because she handles emergency appeals from the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, the case went to Jackson. The “circuit justice” generally plays a straightforward role, setting a briefing schedule and – in big cases – ultimately referring the matter to the full court.   \n \n\n   \n  But as he has raced up to the Supreme Court this year in case after case, Trump has been asking for something else as well: An even shorter-term order known as an “administrative stay,” which freezes the lower court decision while the justices review the written arguments in the case.\n \n\n   \n  That administrative decision, usually, rests with the assigned justice – in this case, Jackson.\n \n\n   \n  A former trial court judge who recently took up boxing as a way to relieve stress, Jackson  ultimately granted Trump’s request , a move that initially raised anxiety among liberals and cheers from conservatives on social media. But Jackson also took several steps that were a departure from how other justices have handled administrative stays.\n \n\n   \n  First, Jackson included a few paragraphs of written explanation in her order, breaking from the   boilerplate-only language usually found in administrative stays. She wrote that she was granting Trump’s request “to facilitate” the appeals court’s “expeditious resolution” of the appeal.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court has faced enormous criticism this year for regularly overturning lower court orders on its emergency docket without explanation. While there are  sometimes good reasons  for brevity in those cases, some justices – such as Justice Elena Kagan – have said the court could  provide a little more explanation .\n \n\n   \n  Second, rather than leaving the timing open-ended, Jackson set her administrative order to lift 48 hours after the appeals court ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson likely understood – or at least assumed – there would be a majority to grant Trump’s request if she didn’t do so. By granting it herself but limiting the timeline, rather than sending it to the full court, she had the effect of bringing the case back to her chambers for a second look in an unusually short order, Vladeck wrote in  widely circulated post  over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Wydra said Jackson handled the case as should be done on the emergency docket. Justices, she said, should deal with the requests “quickly, as transparently as possible, and for logistical reasons, not…make what amount to significant substantive decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston who also wrote about Jackson’s maneuvers, agreed that she appeared to be going “her own way.”\n \n\n   \n  “She has a clear vision of how she wants the shadow docket to be run,” Blackman said.\n \n\n   \n  But, he suggested, it ultimately didn’t work. In the end, as Congress  drew closer to an agreement  to fund the government, the full court extended her administrative stay for a few days without writing to explain why. Jackson wound up in dissent, which she also registered without explanation. And the Trump administration ultimately got what it wanted.    \n \n\n   \n   Trump signed the spending measure  late Wednesday, reopening the federal government and funding the food program. Hours later, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the Supreme Court noting that it was abandoning its appeal – an anticlimactic end to a case that had significant real-world consequences.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, as the court announced it was reopening its doors to the public, a single line was added to the docket in the SNAP appeal: “Application withdrawn.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/breaking-down-the-looming-house-vote-on-the-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-04:00","title":"Breaking down the looming House vote on the Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House is set to vote on a discharge petition to compel the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s files, a decision long delayed by Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump.

He later kept the House out of session for an extraordinarily long time during the shutdown. This carried the benefit – whether it was the express purpose or not – of giving him an excuse not to swear in the decisive 218th member to force the vote.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump, too, clearly did not want this vote. He waged an unsuccessful  11th-hour campaign  on Wednesday to flip the handful of Republicans who signed the “discharge petition.”\n \n\n   \n  But the vote now looms, with Johnson announcing plans to schedule it for next week.  So, what happens next? What could the vote mean? And what are the political dynamics?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hardly the end of the road, but it’s clearly a significant moment that could set the Epstein saga off on a new trajectory.\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that, despite the pushback, this vote isn’t really the destination. It’s not like the House passes the bill, and suddenly the Justice Department releases the full Epstein case files. The bill would still need to be passed by the Senate and signed by the president.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s clearly a reason Johnson and the administration didn’t want the vote. The fear here seems to be that it 1) creates a very difficult decision for many Republican congressmembers, and it 2) could apply pressure on the Senate and the administration to follow suit – particularly if it passes by a large margin in the House.\n \n\n   \n  And the large margin appears to be what many are anticipating. CNN reported this week that House GOP leadership is expecting mass defections. The lead GOP co-sponsor of the discharge petition, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, isn’t exactly lowering expectations, either. He has  set a threshold for success at two-thirds  of the House, or nearly 290 votes, if all members are present.That’s the point at which enough members support the measure that it could overcome a presidential veto.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are somehow able to get two-thirds vote here in the House, [that] puts a lot of pressure on the Senate, and also, if the Senate does pass it, that’s a very serious step for the president,” Massie told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That would indeed be a very symbolic victory. It would not only demonstrate that a wide, bipartisan majority of the House wants the files released, but it would suggest the chamber could actually override Trump’s attempt to block that – whether or not it would ever come to that.\n \n\n   \n  It would require about 75 out of the 219 House Republicans, if every Democrat voted in favor.\n \n\n   \n  Several Republicans have already said they will vote for the bill, despite not having supported Massie’s discharge petition. (Only four Republicans signed the petition.)\n \n\n   \n  And we’re also seeing how this all could start to register in the Senate, with Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana quickly signaling Thursday that the GOP should just go for full transparency. Kennedy had previously voted against an early effort by Senate Democrats to force the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t think this issue is going to go away until that issue is addressed and answered to the American people’s satisfaction,” Kennedy  told CNN’s Kasie Hunt . “And I may end up with  a sombrero on my head  for saying that, but that’s the way I see it.”\n \n\n   \n  These House members clearly face a difficult vote, with compelling dynamics pushing them in both directions.\n \n\n   \n  Among the dynamics pushing them to vote no are loyalty to Trump, which is the coin of the realm in today’s GOP. Trump has made it very clear that he will remember how these members vote.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” Trump  posted Wednesday on social media . He added that there “should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else.”\n \n\n   \n  Voting for the bill would be a significant rebuke of Trump and Johnson, who explicitly fought against this. It would suggest that the other measures taken – such as the House Oversight Committee’s release of some Epstein materials obtained from his estate – just weren’t good enough. Congressional Republicans  almost never buck Trump  like this.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leadership also has reason to try and limit defections, because of the level of pressure it could apply to the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  But on the other side are plenty of dynamics pressuring members to vote for the bill.\n \n\n   \n  The big one is how they would explain the vote to their constituents. The fact is that Americans overwhelmingly want all the files, they’re upset with the lack of transparency thus far, and they expect that the files contain significant information.\n \n\n   \n  Fully 77% of Americans wanted all the files released, as long as victims’ names are redacted, according to an  NPR-PBS-Marist College poll  in September. An earlier  CBS News-YouGov poll  showed 89% said the government should release all its information.\n \n\n   \n  Other  polling  has shown overwhelming majorities of Americans think damaging information about powerful people is contained in the files and that the government hasn’t been transparent enough.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, voting against releasing the records risks making you look like you’re part of a cover-up – a cover-up for pedophilia. And what if the stuff is actually going to come out anyway, and maybe even includes some significant information? Who wants to be one of the people who voted against that transparency?\n \n\n   \n  And that gets at another key dynamic here. At some point, Republicans who once upon a time led the charge to release the Epstein files – at least until the Trump administration reversed itself this summer – might just reason this is going to happen the easy way or the hard way.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Annie Grayer and Kristen Holmes  reported  Friday on a Trump ally on Capitol Hill who told the president directly that they questioned the strategy to keep delaying and downplaying things.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Trump, who hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, in many ways  seems to be seeding suspicion  about what the files might show about his own proximity to the convicted sex offender by fighting the transparency that his administration once promised. (Trump on Friday did push for  more investigation  into Epstein’s ties to high-profile figures — but that probe could be a further obstacle to a possible release of the DOJ’s files.)\n \n\n   \n  At some point, lawmakers might resent that the administration has so mishandled all of this, and view this vote as a chance to force the issue and hopefully get beyond all of it, after months of it looming over their heads.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the case, it’ll be one of the more fascinating votes in a long time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/asia/denis-obrezko-russia-hacker-thailand-void-blizzard","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"02:49:00Z","title":"Russian alleged cyber-hacker faces extradition to US after arrest in Thailand","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Denis Obrezko, a 35-year-old Russian national, was arrested on November 6, 2025, in Phuket, Thailand, in a joint operation led by the FBI and Thailand’s Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau.

Americans could soon see some goods get cheaper after President Donald Trump exempted certain agricultural imports from a set of tariffs on Friday. But any price drops likely won’t be enough to make life feel more affordable any time soon.\n \n\n   \n  The executive order  exempted products like coffee, beef and some fruit  from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which began rolling out in April.\n \n\n   \n  The new exemptions are part of what traders have dubbed TACO, or Trump Always Chickens Out, to describe times when the president backs off a policy after unintended consequences pop up. In the case of tariffs, Trump has already reversed a number of his measures, a sign that the administration  is reshaping his signature economic tool .\n \n\n   \n  The latest TACO comes after voters, worried about affordability,  gave Republicans a drubbing  in recent off-year elections.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the new exemptions generally won’t help improve affordability.\n \n\n   \n  “It depends on what the importers do with the tariff,” he said in a CNBC interview on Friday. “So when you look at the overall price trend, it hasn’t been because of tariffs. It’s been because of these other events going on and just supply and demand.”\n \n\n   \n  But in cases where tariffs have been passed along to consumers, prices could drop, Greer said.\n \n\n   \n  One potential example: bananas. American consumers are paying about 8% more for bananas than before Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  The US largely imports bananas from South American countries. With bananas exempt from “reciprocal” tariffs that started at 10%, prices could go back to where they were earlier this year, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. But it’s unlikely to be something most consumers notice unless they’re buying bananas often, she added.\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone is convinced it will even do that much.\n \n\n   \n  “It is not clear that lowering tariffs will lower prices — it depends on what retailers think they can get away with. The import price of bananas has fallen since tariffs were imposed, but the US consumer price has risen,” Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS global wealth management, said in a note last week. (The United States tracks import prices before accounting for tariffs. In some cases, import prices have fallen as exporters lower what they charge as a way to share in the tariff expense importers pay.)\n \n\n   \n    Make America more affordable?\n \n\n   \n  The White House has ramped up its efforts to convince voters that affordability issues are just a hangover from former President Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  “Putting Joe Biden’s inflation crisis firmly behind us has been a priority for President Trump since Day One, when he signed an array of executive orders to slash costly regulations and unleash American energy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  But economists generally agree that Trump’s tariffs aren’t making matters better.\n \n\n   \n  And while prices normally fluctuate, especially for food, they generally get more expensive over time, House said. “That’s why this isn’t going to, I think, cure consumers’ angst about elevated prices,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/alina-habba-office-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"11:55:00.000-05:00","title":"Man Ransacks New Jersey Federal Prosecutor’s Office After Being Denied Meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man, Keith Michael Lisa, allegedly ransacked the New Jersey federal prosecutor’s office after being denied a meeting with US Attorney Alina Habba.

are federal agents truly ‘untouchable’ in the eyes of the law? \n       \n  Analysis by Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Mere hours after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer  shot a suspect  last month – wounding a member of the arrest team in the process – the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles effectively exonerated the agent who opened fire.\n \n\n   \n  “PSA: A vehicle is a deadly weapon,” First Assistant US Attorney Bill Essayli wrote in  a social media post.  “Using it against law enforcement justifies their use of deadly force in self-defense.”\n \n\n   \n  Essayli alleged the man who was shot had rammed his car into vehicles driven by immigration agents trying to arrest him, “causing agents to worry for their safety,” and prompting one of them to discharge his weapon, wounding the man and, inadvertently, a deputy US marshal.\n \n\n   \n  Under policy, immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. Still, federal law enforcement agencies have historically spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent’s use of force was appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  But after recent high-profile use of force encounters, federal officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents, raising questions about whether previously enshrined mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been all but abandoned in President Donald Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely due to Trump’s installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI – the agencies traditionally tasked with investigating and prosecuting suspected civil rights violations by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  And since many immigration agents typically  do not wear body cameras  — a point of contention that has at times led to intense friction among the enforcers themselves — there has often been scant ability to verify competing narratives following use of force incidents.\n \n\n   \n  “If it’s purely the ICE agent’s word against someone else, game over,” one federal law enforcement source said. “Unless it’s beyond egregious and on film, they are basically untouchable.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Allowed to do whatever the hell they want’\n \n\n   \n  In August, Trump himself effectively gave American law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances. In announcing  the federal takeover of the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department , the president lamented images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers.\n \n\n   \n  “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”’ and they can hit real hard,”  Trump said . “And they’re standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything.”\n \n\n   \n  “But now,” he added,﻿ “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”\n \n\n   \n  A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump’s immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN. Many are concerned DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security have grown less willing to objectively scrutinize the actions of agents and ensure their rigorous adherence to the Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Following  a recent purge of career DOJ employees , sources also worry that federal prosecutors responsible for evaluating the conduct of agents will choose not to investigate questionable incidents for fear of running afoul of Trump’s political priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a zero chance of an (immigration) agent being criminally charged with this administration,” said one senior DOJ lawyer who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They must be held accountable’\n \n\n   \n  While the Justice Department has vociferously defended the actions of immigration agents, state and local officials in some jurisdictions have pushed back, threatening to find ways of holding accountable federal agents accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law,”  Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi  said in a statement last month before Trump called off a planned surge of immigration agents to her San Francisco district.\n \n\n   \n  The former House speaker was backed up by the local district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, who said on social media, “If a federal agent breaks the law, they must be held accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago has been another flashpoint, where clashes between agents and the public have spurred numerous allegations of excessive use of force.\n \n\n   \n  A Presbyterian minister said he was praying outside a suburban ICE facility during demonstrations there last month when he was  struck in the head by pepper balls . Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the protesters had blocked an ICE vehicle from leaving the facility and threw rocks and bottles and launched fireworks at agents – a claim the pastor disputed.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents have also faced scrutiny in the Windy City after text messages  appeared to show an agent bragging  about his marksmanship skills after shooting a driver accused of ramming the agent’s vehicle five times.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the city, the  mayor of the suburb of Evanston  announced two investigations after federal agents were filmed striking a person during an arrest. DHS said the agents were conducting an immigration enforcement operation when another vehicle struck theirs, and that a “hostile crowd” gathered around the agents.\n \n\n   \n  City officials were “thinking through options, including going to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, or potentially communicating with our state’s attorney to figure out the right way to demand justice for our residents who were assaulted,” Mayor Daniel Biss, a Democrat running for Congress, said.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to federal activity in his state,  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker , a Democrat, signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to “create a detailed record” of agents’ actions. In doing so, the governor said the federal government was “pushing the boundaries of their authority.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once this all ends, I believe there will be people of good faith who will review what the Commission has recorded and will demand answers and accountability,” Pritzker said.\n \n\n   \n  The police chief of Durango, Colorado, has asked state authorities to investigate an incident last month where a federal officer was seen on video appearing to place a protester who had confronted him in a chokehold and shove her down an embankment.\n \n\n   \n  No known charges have been filed against the protester, who  told The Colorado Sun  the encounter left her with pain in her head, back and neck.\n \n\n   \n  “It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,” Chief Brice Current  told The New York Times .\n \n\n   \n  The  Colorado Bureau of Investigation  “will investigate whether there were state criminal law violations during the incident,” it said. Like other states, Colorado law requires that use of force by law enforcement officers must be reasonable and appropriate to a particular situation.\n \n\n   \n    Immunity claims dubious, experts say\n \n\n   \n  Threats of possible prosecution by state and local officials have come with the ire of Trump political appointees.\n \n\n   \n  “The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,” Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche  wrote on X .  \n \n\n   \n  White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller echoed that, directly addressing federal agents on Fox News, saying, “You have federal immunity in he conduct of your duties. And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony.”\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say Miller’s claim of absolutely immunity is dubious.  US criminal law  allows for the prosecution of federal and local officers who violate someone’s civil rights, including by using excessive force.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s true that federal officers have overwhelmingly broad protection when they’re carrying out their official duties,” said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “But it’s ludicrous to suggest that a federal officer who breaks state or federal law can’t ever be held accountable for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts also note the Justice Department isn’t handcuffed in policing federal agents – just that it now lacks the will to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “It is, to be clear, wrong on its face,” CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center,  wrote in his newsletter, “One First,”  of Miller’s comments. The federal government retains the power to prosecute federal officers, Vladeck wrote, even if the Trump administration “is wholly uninterested” in doing so.\n \n\n   \n  As for the states, “There may be political reasons why local or state prosecutors will be wary of bringing such cases,” Vladeck said. “But … the relevant law is far more permissive when it comes to the ability to hold federal officers accountable than Stephen Miller would have you believe.”\n \n\n   \n    Clash over body cams exacerbates the issue\n \n\n   \n  While numerous viral bystander videos have surfaced depicting heated encounters between immigration agents and members of the public, one critical tool often used to identify potential wrongdoing by police officers isn’t widely used in the immigration space: body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The topic of body cameras has at times caused friction between immigration agents and FBI agents assigned to assist with enforcement efforts, two law enforcement sources familiar with the situation previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  While FBI agents have worn body cameras during joint arrest operations per their agency’s policy, some immigration agents not wearing body cameras have expressed concern to their counterparts about having their tactics recorded, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  During one heated exchange, immigration agents who did not want to be captured on body camera footage refused to invite FBI agents along for an arrest operation, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, US District Court Judge Sara Ellis has ordered that agents to wear and use body cameras during confrontations there – a decision the Trump administration is now appealing. Ellis expressed frustration during a hearing last week, indicating that she believed administration officials were being misleading about the safety concerns surrounding protests at an ICE facility and immigration raids in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have insisted that  federal agents are facing unprecedented levels of attack . DHS says it has observed “a 1,000% increase in assaults against ICE officers.”\n \n\n   \n  While instances of violence directed at immigration officers have been documented, legal experts say there must be a distinction between actions they take in self-defense and the questionable, aggressive tactics agents have used against protesters and suspects.\n \n\n   \n  “If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped),” wrote Walter Olson, senior legal fellow at  the libertarian Cato Institute .\n \n\n   \n  At stake, he said, is a possible shift in culture among immigration officers who may now believe they can do no wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “If the agents are hearing a persistent message from their higher-ups of ‘you’re immune no matter what you do,’” Olson says, “it’s up to the rest of us to disabuse them of that error.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/style/dave-celebrity-restaurant-polaroid-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"06:50:00-04:00","title":"How Davé became the ultimate celebrity hotspot","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For over 36 years, the Chinese restaurant Davé on Rue Saint-Roch in Paris’s 1st Arrondissement became a legendary celebrity hotspot due to its intimate, private atmosphere and the custom of displaying polaroids of famous guests on its walls.

    \n  By Zoe Whitfield, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:50 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s not uncommon for a bar or café to remind patrons that someone famous once ate there by having a physical photograph of said VIP on display. For 36 years however, at Davé, a Chinese restaurant on Rue Saint-Roch in Paris’s 1st Arrondissement, polaroids of beloved guests were less a marketing tactic than a key feature of the building’s interior, framed and affixed to any available wall space.\n \n\n   \n  The various portraits, which included those of the singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, filmmaker David Lynch, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, model Kate Moss, and entrepreneur and socialite Kim Kardashian, made up something akin to a personal album for owner Tai “Davé” Cheung.\n \n\n   \n  “The immediacy fascinated me,” the restauranteur told CNN, recalling his initial interest in the polaroid. He purchased the camera, at least partly inspired by Andy Warhol, the same year he opened Davé, in 1982, a year and half after his father’s restaurant shuttered. The photographer Helmut Newton and his wife June were early fans (so much so they spent a Christmas on the premises), quickly followed by Vogue’s Grace Coddington, until eventually Davé’s clientele was near-exclusively comprised of significant figures from the arenas of fashion, film, art, literature and music, as a new book, “ A Night at Davé ,” celebrates.\n \n\n   \n  Conceived with writers Charles Morin and Boris Bergmann and released by the London publisher IDEA, the book boasts 115 pages of photographs and selfies, as well as doodles and postcards from several guests. Sofia Coppola, whose father Francis Ford Coppola once booked the entire restaurant for New Year’s Eve, wrote the foreword. “I was fourteen and the place was filled with the fashion and show business of that era, people table-hopping and hanging out, platters of Davé’s mom’s Chinese food and Davé taking polaroids,” she recalled, characterizing the mood that night. “Somehow I ended up cozied up with Yves Saint Laurent” — one of the 20th century’s foremost designers.\n \n\n   \n  “A party always felt like a kind of family gathering, something intimate,” Davé, as he is habitually referred, said over email. “Everything was closed, it created a very private, familial atmosphere.” Even outside the parameters of a private party, the discreet milieu of the restaurant — largely down to Davé’s considered seating arrangements and further encouraged by the scarce lighting (the glow of a tropical fish tank in the center of the space helped somewhat) — meant famous people, who would otherwise typically be bothered by strangers, felt comfortable and relaxed enough that most would return multiple times, making Davé the place to be.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in The New York Times in August 1998, Dana Thomas observed, “You can gauge who’s in and who’s out simply by what happens when he or she walks into Davé,” alluding to the owner’s guarded system. That it was close to Jardin des Tuileries, where much of Paris Fashion Week played out, further enamored it to editors, stylists, and models. Indeed, in January 2005, The Guardian ran a profile of the restaurant with the headline, “Welcome to the fashion canteen” (by this point Davé had moved to new premises, about ten minutes away on Rue de Richelieu, but still within the vicinity of fashion week footfall).\n \n\n   \n  With its distinctive swirling logo above the front door and, famously, always with a “complet” (meaning “full”) sign in the window, a practice that meant Davé was able to ensure space was kept available for his celebrity regulars, the polaroid was a frequent feature of any night at the restaurant. “It was very instinctive (taking photographs). I wanted to preserve the beauty and joy of those moments, I didn’t know it would become a thing,” said Davé, who was taught how to focus the camera by the photographer and director, Jean-Baptiste Mondino. “At the beginning, the polaroids just piled up. One day someone stole one — that’s when I understood they had value, that they were objects of desire.”\n \n\n   \n  The images that appear in the new book were safely stored away for years (most of those on the walls of the restaurant were copies, a preemptive measure to secure the memories had a future), but Davé estimates he produced a few thousand over the years. “I’ve lost some, given some away, but most are still with me. I particularly love the photos I took of people on the phone, like Aurore Clément, Keith Haring, and Mick Jagger. It’s rare to see them photographed like that,” he noted, recalling pictures of people using the landline. “They (the wider clientele) were very happy because they could see the result immediately. There’s no surprise with the polaroid — you can’t take bad pictures of people without them knowing.”\n \n\n   \n  More than four decades after the restaurant opened, and seven years since it closed its doors for the last time, working on “A Night at Davé” has been a thoroughly positive experience for Davé. “I thought that polaroids no longer had a place — that the phone has replaced them — but I loved diving back into my archives,” he said. “I didn’t feel sadness, nostalgia, or regret (putting the book together). I loved learning from people, diving into their worlds, their universes, so I was happy to see all the good moments I’d lived.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/europe/russias-nord-stream-pipelines-europe-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"03:31:00-04:31","title":"The explosions that tore through Russia’s pipelines to Europe are still causing rifts years on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2022 explosions of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which severed Russia’s gas supply to Europe, continue to provoke international legal and political tensions.

pipelines to Europe are still causing rifts years on \n       \n  By Joseph Ataman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:31 AM EST, Sat November 15, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It was a late September night when muffled blasts and a stream of bubbles broke the surface of the Baltic Sea.  Explosions  had ripped through the two Nord Stream gas pipelines, Russia’s gas highway into Europe, months after Moscow’s full invasion of Ukraine. Years later, shockwaves from that night are still rippling across the continent.\n \n\n   \n  The 2022 attack on the hugely controversial pipelines triggered an international whodunnit, with suspicion falling immediately on Russia and even the US being forced to deny involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Today, intrigue continues to swirl around the blasts even as Germany readies a prosecution against the  suspected Ukrainian saboteurs . And Poland’s efforts to stymie the case – seemingly to shield its ally Ukraine - has thrown up new tensions in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Germany seems determined for Nord Stream to gets its day in court, filing arrest warrants for two Ukrainian men – Volodymyr Zhuravlov, who was detained in Poland, and Serhii Kuznietsov, who was detained in Italy - suspected of involvement in the blast.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of other nations have cast doubt on whether criminal proceedings should be brought against those allegedly responsible.\n \n\n   \n  A decision by a Polish court in mid-October to free Zhuravlov, after slow-balling the man’s extradition, has severely undercut Berlin’s hopes of a prosecution. In the eyes of the judge, if the Nord Stream blasts were a Ukrainian act of sabotage, that would be a justified response to an unprovoked invasion.\n \n\n   \n  “If Ukraine was indeed the organizer of this act of aggression, then only Ukraine can be held responsible for this event,” Judge Dariusz Lubowski said in his verdict halting Zhuravlov’s extradition to Germany, CNN affiliate TVN24  reported .\n \n\n   \n  The 49-year-old Ukrainian claims he had nothing to do with the attack and that he was in Ukraine at the time it happened, according to TVN24.\n \n\n   \n  German prosecutors allege Zhuravlov, a “trained diver,” was “part of a group of individuals who placed explosives on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines near the island of Bornholm in September 2022.” The team allegedly used fake identities to rent a yacht to ferry them and their equipment to the blast site.\n \n\n   \n  Serhii Kuznietsov, a 49-year-old former Ukrainian soldier and an alleged coordinator of the operation, was detained on a German warrant in Italy in late August.\n \n\n   \n  Kuznietsov’s defense lawyer Nicola Canestrini told CNN that the Ukrainian denies any wrongdoing and he is currently appealing Italy’s Supreme Court’s decision to extradite him to Germany.\n \n\n   \n  “Europe’s problem, Ukraine’s problem, the problem of Lithuania and Poland, is not that Nord Stream 2 was blown up, but that it was built,”   Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told journalists in early October.\n \n\n   \n  “It is certainly not in the interest of Poland, nor in the interest of decency and justice, to prosecute or extradite this citizen to another state,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Tusk’s stance reflects long-standing concerns over the pipelines within Europe and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  As far back as 2007, Poland’s then-defense minister Radek Sikorski  railed  against the proposed Nord Stream 1 pipeline as, “the most outrageous attempt by Mr Putin to divide and damage the EU.”\n \n\n   \n  Europe’s dependency on Russian hydrocarbons has faced opposition from US administrations going back to the White House of George W. Bush. That feeling has long been bipartisan: as Republican Senator Ted Cruz told senators in 2019: the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, “if completed, would make Europe even more dependent on Russian energy, even more vulnerable to Russian blackmail.”\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, the Polish stance exposed divisions in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  “Shocking” was how Peter Szijjarto, foreign minister of Hungary – one of Russia’s few allies on the continent and the recent recipient of a  US exemption  allowing them to continue buying Russian oil and gas - described Tusk’s stance.\n \n\n   \n  “One thing is clear: we don’t want a Europe where prime ministers defend terrorists,” he  wrote on X. \n \n\n   \n  For many in Europe’s north, the attention on who blew up Nord Stream is a distraction from remembering how it was built in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Lithuania’s former foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told CNN that, if you take the legal case in isolation, “it might force us to forget how we got there.” The Polish government’s position “has quite a lot to do with their internal politics, their president being from a very nationalist party,”\n \n\n   \n  Helga Kalm, deputy director of Estonia’s International Center for Defence and Security, told CNN. “It’s their sign of showing Germany that they’re doing the wrong thing” in pursuing a prosecution that could harm Ukrainian interests.\n \n\n   \n  Many in Europe’s post-Soviet countries, Poland chief among them, finally feel vindicated after decades of warning against the push from European powers like Germany to warm ties with Russia.\n \n\n   \n    Hunt for ‘justice’\n \n\n   \n  Both  Denmark  and Sweden – whose waters sit astride the Nord Stream pipeline – declined to pursue cases into the blasts, with Sweden citing a lack of jurisdiction.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Germany has forged ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a rule of law state,” Stefan Meister, an expert on Eastern Europe from the German Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN\n \n\n   \n  “I think this is particularly for domestic purposes,” he added. With right-wing populists the AfD challenging the credibility of state institutions, allowing German justice to follow its course is about, “the credibility of the system and the institution and the ruling political elites,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Germany was the driving force in Europe behind the Nord Stream pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  And it reaped the benefits. In 2016, nearly 30% of German gas needs were met by Russian suppliers, funnelling gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, according to  German government figures .\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s chancellor between 1998 and 2005, Gerhard Schroeder, went on to try to join the board of Russian energy giant Gazprom and became chairman of Russia’s oil giant Rosneft after leaving office.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, the pipelines became totemic of the dependence on cheap Russian hydrocarbons that critics felt Europe traded for a principled stance on Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  Former Chancellor Angela Merkel attracted special criticism for her conciliatory approach to Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  In Merkel’s recently released memoir, she rebutted accusations that Germany had been dependent on Russian gas, writing, “particularly in the case of Nord Stream 2, even though no gas had ever been transported through this pipeline… It was a relic of a failed investment.”\n \n\n   \n  Given how interwoven many in German politics were with the push to construct the Nord Stream pipelines, today many politicians would welcome distancing themselves from the case, Meister said.\n \n\n   \n  “My impression is they want to wash themselves clean,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Need for clarity\n \n\n   \n  The fog around the case only serves to feed tensions in Europe at a time when unity against Russia, and an unpredictable ally in the US, is all-important. Russia’s efforts to sow divisions abroad are well documented but here the Kremlin may have achieved one of its goals without lifting a finger.\n \n\n   \n  Nord Stream risks “further questions and maybe fractures within the alliance,” Landsbergis said. “Especially at a time where we’re no longer at peace, that should be remembered.”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the result of Germany’s quest for judicial satisfaction over Nord Stream, Russian gas won’t be flowing south like it did before 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe has battled to wean itself off a decades-long dependence on Russia gas. The loss of Nord Stream only hastened that.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s share of EU imports of pipeline gas dropped from more than 40% in 2021 to about 11% in 2024, according to  EU figures .\n \n\n   \n  “The right place for Nord Stream 2 is at the bottom of the sea, in pieces,” Estonia’s Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in March.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/middleeast/gaza-high-school-graduations-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"04:52:00-05:00","title":"Bittersweet moments of joy as Gaza celebrates high school graduations without schools","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a bittersweet celebration of high school graduation, 56,000 students in Gaza marked a rare moment of joy amid the ongoing war, which has devastated the region's education system.

Minister of Education.\n \n\n   \n  But for the 18-year-old, the celebration was bittersweet.\n \n\n   \n  Like some 56,000 other students from Gaza’s class of 2025, the last two years of her education have been nearly completely disrupted by Israel’s  war in Gaza , which has killed almost 19,000 school age children, made orphans out of thousands of others, and all but decimated the enclave’s formal  education system .\n \n\n   \n  “Our happiness is incomplete because our supporter and the pillar of the house is not here,” she told CNN, speaking of her father, who was absent from the celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Doaa’s father Bassam Musallam was critically wounded by shrapnel in November 2023, when an Israeli strike hit a neighboring house and killed his friend in central Gaza, the family told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Musallam was evacuated to Egypt for medical treatment in April 2024 and has been there since, missing many milestones in his daughter’s life, including her exam results, which have gone viral.\n \n\n   \n  When she sent her father a photo of the celebrations, standing proudly next to her brother in her graduation gown and cap in front of a bright yellow balloon sign that read: “Congratulations,” she felt like the entire enclave was celebrating with her.\n \n\n   \n  “You are a hero,” Palestinian Minister of Education Amjad Barham told Doaa over the phone as he called to congratulate her on graduating high school and earning the highest grade of any student in Gaza, at 99.7%.\n \n\n   \n  Doaa’s joyful scene was emulated throughout Gaza Thursday, in bright moments that have been rare over the past two years. As the education ministry announced the grades for tens of thousands of high school students like Doaa, there was a buzz in the air as Palestinians set off fireworks and embraced in song and dance.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud Elyan, a recent graduate who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to central Gaza, stood at a crowded dessert shop in his hometown with a grin on his face.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy beyond words,” he told Palestinian state TV. “I am here to buy desserts and hand them out to people because it’s been a long time that people haven’t seen desserts after two years of war and displacement.”\n \n\n   \n  For others, graduation day is a reminder of that suffering.\n \n\n   \n  Student Doha Nazmi Abu Dalal, who had been displaced in Deir el Balah, central Gaza, achieved a near perfect GPA. But she was killed less than a month before she could see how her hard work had paid off. Abu Dalal, along with 17 members of her family, was killed in an Israeli strike on October 29, weeks after the ceasefire was implemented, according to hospital authorities.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘scholasticide’\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since October 7, 2023, has decimated the education system in Gaza, leaving it on the brink of collapse, according to UNICEF, and prompting accusations from UN experts of a  scholasticide , or the systematic destruction of a country’s education.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has repeatedly said Hamas uses schools and universities as part of its infrastructure to store weapons or as command centers. It has not addressed the scholasticide accusation directly.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously told CNN it seeks to minimize civilian harm while Hamas “cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes.”\n \n\n   \n  Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed over 97% of schools in Gaza, according to UNICEF, leaving hundreds of thousands of children with limited access to in-person learning.\n \n\n   \n  At least 18,591 school age students have been killed and 27,216 injured over the course of the war, according to the Palestinian education ministry figures. In addition, some 792 educational staff have been killed and 3,251 injured.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hassan Ali Radwan is one of the Palestinian students who experienced the loss of one of his loved ones when his cousin and study buddy was killed during the war. Like his classmates, Al-Hassan had to navigate the challenges of online education amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a hard time with internet connection, the lack of electricity and water as well as displacement and most importantly food,” Al-Hassan told WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, at a shelter for the displaced in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza on Thursday, where he and his friends had gathered to celebrate his graduation.\n \n\n   \n  In central Gaza, another graduate, Dima, who only gave her first name to state media, was celebrating with her family after overcoming trauma attached to her studies.\n \n\n   \n  She said she suffered minor injuries from an Israeli strike that happened during her first private math lesson – at a sporting club – after the war had started.\n \n\n   \n  “I stopped studying for some time because I was scared,” she said. “But I eventually had to keep going because we only get to be highschoolers once in a lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n    Going to university, without the campus\n \n\n   \n  Gaza’s 56,000 new graduates are ready for college, according to the education ministry. But there are hardly any campuses to attend.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli attacks have completely destroyed  63 university buildings  over the past two years, according to the ministry.\n \n\n   \n  And resources are scarce.  Educational supplies, like stationery, backpacks, and other resources, have been  “impossible” to bring into the enclave, despite the implementation of the October 10 ceasefire, because they are not deemed as “lifesaving humanitarian aid,” UNICEF said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some students and parents are riding the high of Thursday’s graduations, and are hopeful that Gaza’s schools and universities will soon be rebuilt.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 92% of all education facilities will require either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation to become functional again, according to a recent  UNICEF statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the pain and ache in Gaza, we want to be happy and get over our wounds,” Dima’s father said. “Students need to be back in classrooms as soon as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, others are calling for mechanisms to help pursue college scholarships and study abroad, rather than going back online to study.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not life, they (Israel) destroyed our schools and universities,” recent graduate Mohamed Bilal Abu Faraj told Palestinian state media on Thursday after handing out desserts at a shelter.\n \n\n   \n  “Open up the border,” he added, nodding to the continued siege on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  For Doaa, her father’s injury has fueled her interest in pursuing a higher education in nursing.\n \n\n   \n  She too, hopes to continue her education abroad, where she yearns to reunite with her father once again.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Abeer Salman contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/us/trump-administration-compensation-flight-disruptions-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"13:51:00-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Drops Plan to Require Passenger Compensation for Delayed Flights","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has formally withdrawn a proposed rule from the Biden administration that would have required U.S. airlines to pay passengers cash compensation for flight delays of three hours or more.

Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later on Friday confirmed she would launch the investigation on Trump’s orders, assigning Jay Clayton, the top prosecutor in New York’s southern district, to lead the federal probe.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you, Mr. President,” she wrote in a  post on X  that included a screenshot of Trump’s request.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, after Bondi ordered the FBI to review Epstein files for release, Justice and FBI officials conducted another assessment and determined there were no additional prosecutions that could be brought based on the evidence at hand, according to law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s move on Friday   represents the president’s most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of the president’s belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Why doesn’t he just release these? Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. “Now he’s in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  lengthy thread on X , Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, blasted Trump’s directive and called on the administration to release all the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  “The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein,” he wrote, adding later, “I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Clinton  said on X : “These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Summers for comment about Trump’s demands for an investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank “ended our relationship with (Epstein) years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump earlier this week  tried and failed  to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department’s Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.\n \n\n   \n  Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert some documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee that had not yet been released. Trump appeared to acknowledge Friday that was part of a bid by his administration to dissuade her from driving more conversation on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “When you talk about the Epstein hoax, what happens is, you’re not talking about how well we’ve done,” Trump added while speaking aboard Air Force One. “That’s the whole purpose behind them. They want to waste people’s time and some of the dumber Republicans like that, but it’s mostly Democrats, by the way.”\n \n\n   \n  But they could not change her mind.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realization that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  But the newly announced criminal investigation could give the Justice Department a new justification to resist turning over files — or convince some lawmakers to back off. Generally, the department resists giving Congress files during an ongoing criminal investigation because any public release could jeopardize the integrity of the probe or any resulting criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “This will certainly give members of Congress a basis on which to vote against disclosing the Epstein files,” CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. “If there’s an ongoing criminal investigation, that’s a perfectly good reason for Congress to back off or to vote no.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the controversy Friday night, Trump told reporters he and Epstein had “a very bad relationship for years,” and sought to turn the focus to those he had demanded face investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Summers, whatever his name is, and all of the other people that he spent time with, Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years. But he also saw strength, because I was president, so he dictated a couple of memos to himself. Give me a break. You’re gonna find out what did he know, with respect to Bill Clinton, with respect to the head of Harvard, with respect to all of those people that he knew, including JP Morgan Chase,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails released earlier this week, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails “prove literally nothing” and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein “hoax” to distract from the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration’s response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump doesn’t want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn’t prove anything,” one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  In the 24 hours after the House Oversight Committee’s Wednesday release of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name, Trump had declined to take questions from the press. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.” He then took questions from reporters while flying to Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote in one post.\n \n\n   \n  He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into “many other people and institutions” in a subsequent Truth Social post.\n \n\n   \n  In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  Clinton and Epstein had been friendly in the early 2000s, with the former president appearing on Epstein’s private jet logs at least 16 times between 2002 and 2003 for trips he said were related to Clinton Foundation work. Clinton would  later write  that his relationship with Epstein had ended by 2003 before he was aware of the financier’s crimes. Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein’s survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell, Kit Maher, Evan Perez and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/americas/venezuela-maduro-noriega-panama-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:01:00-05:00","title":"As Washington weighs options on Venezuela, US invasion of Panama offers an imperfect blueprint for military action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the historical precedent of the 1989 US invasion of Panama, which removed military dictator Manuel Noriega, accused of drug trafficking and election rigging, and draws parallels to current US considerations of military action against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

I am very glad President Trump is dedicated to ending this reign of terror,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Officials from all three countries have denied any ties to trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike Maduro, a committed socialist and longtime thorn in the side of US foreign policy aims in the region, Noriega, at least initially, presented himself as a US ally.\n \n\n   \n  Through much of his bloody rise to power in Panama – the small but geopolitically key country with its canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans – Noriega was a CIA asset, assisting to stamp out the spread of leftist governments in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  But as CIA arms flowed through Panama to support anti-communist rebels in Central America, Noriega had a secret: He was also allowing tons of cocaine to pass north to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega’s fungible loyalties led former US Ambassador to Panama Ambler Moss to declare of the Panamanian dictator, “You can’t buy him, but you can sure as hell rent him.”\n \n\n   \n  By 1989 Noriega’s double dealing and brutal crackdown on civil society led to Washington issuing an ultimatum: Go into exile or else.\n \n\n   \n  Like Maduro today – who vehemently denies US allegations of drug trafficking – Noriega had to choose whether to flee or face off with a military far superior to his own.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, retired Panamanian General Rubén Darío Paredes told CNN, Noriega opted for exile.\n \n\n   \n  “He began making arrangements for the succession of command according to the hierarchy, but he had a moment of weakness,” Paredes said. “When many of that group who had been exposed began to think about their fate, right? They were exposed, and they made common cause and convinced Noriega that he was the ultimate authority, that there was no turning back. Then Noriega backed down and that’s when the invasion happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing Noriega’s defiance and worsening repression, US President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama – codenamed “Operation Just Cause” – in December 1989, arguing Noriega’s rule posed a threat to US lives and security.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 20,000 US troops on Panamanian soil, Noriega took refuge in the Vatican’s embassy in Panama City for 10 days. US troops surrounded the compound with loudspeakers blasting his hideout with deafening heavy metal music through the night.\n \n\n   \n  Noriega eventually surrendered to US Drug Enforcement Administration officials on January 3, 1990.\n \n\n   \n  His trial in 1991 was called the “trial of the century” by the DEA and eventually saw him found guilty on eight counts and sentenced to 40 years in jail.\n \n\n   \n  While taking down a repressive leader with ties to drug cartels – Maduro also faces a US indictment for trafficking – seems identical to US’ goals in Venezuela, there are important differences.\n \n\n   \n  Panama in 1989, when the US invasion took place, only had a population of 2.5 million, Venezuela’s population today is over 28 million.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s land mass is more than ten times the size of Panama – which, at the time of the invasion, hosted US military bases.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, as with Noriega when he considered exile, many in Maduro’s inner circle face US trafficking allegations or million-dollar rewards for their capture, making them unlikely to see him leave power without a fight.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, any US military action in Venezuela would likely have to contend with the country’s impenetrable jungles and dense slums, where gang members are so heavily armed that even the Venezuelan military rarely enters.\n \n\n   \n  Frank Mora, former US Ambassador at the organization of American states OAS who has studied how a possible US invasion could unfold and the hurdles the US military faces in deposing Maduro, said the US could topple the Venezuelan leader easily but keeping the peace is another matter.\n \n\n   \n  “The question of Venezuelan military capability is not a serious one,” Mora said. “It’s not one that could sustain a US invasion, but my concern has always been, it’s not just the time that it requires to bring down the regime, it’s the day after, and how do you maintain order in a country that has essentially collapsed?”\n \n\n   \n  While it remains unclear if the US will put any boots on the ground or even carry out strikes in Venezuela, increasingly it appears the US will not count on the support of many regional allies.\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference on Thursday, Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, who publicly opposed the Noriega dictatorship before the US invasion, said his country would not host any US forces that might take part in a military action against Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “In relation to Venezuela we don’t have anything to do with that,” Mulino said. “Panama is not lending its territory for any hostile act against Venezuela or another country in the world.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/europe/welsh-police-arrest-man-impersonating-navy-officer-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00Z","title":"Man Charged Over Allegedly Impersonating High-Ranking Navy Officer at Remembrance Sunday Parade","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Carley, a 64-year-old man from Harlech, northern Wales, has been charged with unlawfully wearing a navy uniform and displaying military medals during a Remembrance Sunday wreath-laying ceremony in Llandudno on November 9, 2025.

 \n  A divided federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration on Friday in a case over the president’s use of the  Alien Enemies Act  in deportation matters — but it did not fully snuff out a lower court judge’s efforts to punish those who ignored previous orders halting the president’s use of the law.\n \n\n   \n  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday declined to reinstate an order from US District Judge James Boasberg that found “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for violating his prior orders to temporarily stop using the law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n \n\n   \n  The Friday appeals court ruling is the latest blow to Boasberg’s efforts to hold accountable the administration officials who didn’t follow his orders earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three months ago, a three-judge panel of the appeals court wiped away Boasberg’s contempt ruling from April. Now, the entire appeals court has decided to keep that ruling intact.\n \n\n   \n  But the court’s decision does not fully tie Boasberg’s hands. Because of the way the appeals court ruled this summer – and the court’s decision on Friday to not disturb that ruling – Boasberg is able to move forward with his fact-finding inquiry around the officials involved in the matter, and several members of the court went out of their way to make that point clear Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court remains free to require the government to identify the decision makers who directed the potentially contemptuous actions and to carefully consider next steps,” three appeals court judges wrote in a statement respecting the court’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the migrants at the center of the case, said the court’s latest ruling “allows us to go back before Judge Boasberg and present all of the new evidence from the whistleblower that the government deliberately violated the court’s order not to hand over the Venezuelan men to El Salvador.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, an ex-Justice Department lawyer alleged in a whistleblower complaint that a then-top DOJ official told his colleagues in March that the administration intended to ignore court orders as part of the government’s aggressive deportation effort.\n \n\n   \n  In court proceedings this summer, Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, raised the whistleblower’s claims, saying he would be interested in scrutinizing them should any contempt proceedings before him start back up.\n \n\n   \n  Three judges at the DC Circuit – all of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents – dissented from the court’s decision on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In a stinging dissent penned by appeals court Judge Florence Pan, the appointee of former President Joe Biden skewered the Trump administration’s “meritless appeal” of Boasberg’s ruling from April and her colleagues’ earlier decision to scramble the judge’s plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Our constitutional system was functioning as designed until a panel of this court improvidently intervened,” Pan wrote. “The district court was called upon to check an allegedly unlawful policy implemented by the Executive Branch. When the government apparently defied a court order, the district court properly investigated. In merely seeking information about the government’s apparent contempt of court, the district court did not violate any nondiscretionary duty nor clearly abuse its discretion.”\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg, she said, “did nothing wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Pan also pointed to comments from President Donald Trump earlier this year that were critical of Boasberg as the case was unfolding. Trump called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “We should not leave in place a ruling that says that the district court erred when it did not,” she wrote. “We live in a world in which judges face threats and harassment because of their rulings and have been called ‘rogue’ by government officials who disagree with them. And we cannot overlook that, in response to this very case, the President of the United States called for the district judge’s impeachment.”\n \n\n   \n  She continued: “The district court performed its constitutional duty with unwavering integrity and courage, in the face of undue public criticism from the most powerful official in our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  In the case before Boasberg, the judge had ordered the administration in mid-March to turn around planes carrying migrants being deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.\n \n\n   \n  The flights continued, and the migrants were held at the prison for several months before being released this summer as part of a prisoner swap with Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court ultimately determines that the Government’s actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt,”  Boasberg wrote in a 46-page ruling detailing his decision  in April.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/entertainment/sag-awards-changes-name","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00Z","title":"The SAG Awards has a new, less confusing name","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Screen Actors Guild Awards is being rebranded to the 'Actor Awards' presented by SAG-AFTRA, aligning the show's name with its iconic statuette.

bird flu virus never before reported in people is behind first human case in US in nine months \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Washington resident has been hospitalized with bird flu, according to the Washington State Health Department, and they’re infected with a strain of the virus that hasn’t been seen in humans before.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months, but the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  says that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.\n \n\n   \n  The patient, who has been hospitalized with H5N5 avian influenza since early this month, is described as an older resident of Grays Harbor County who has underlying health issues. It isn’t clear exactly how they caught the virus; state and local public health and agriculture officials are investigating, but they suspect that the person may have been exposed through backyard poultry.\n \n\n   \n  The virus spreads through an animal’s saliva, mucus and feces, or through milk from dairy cattle. The general risk of bird flu goes up in the late fall and winter as birds migrate and come into contact with other animals like backyard flocks.\n \n\n   \n  Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.\n \n\n   \n  There has been no known human-to-human transmission of the virus in the US, but public health leaders in Washington are contacting people who may have been in close contact with the Grays Harbor patient to check for symptoms and offer testing and treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the overall risk to the public is low, Dr. Richard Webby says, the virus still has “pandemic potential.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s clear it’s not an easy leap for this virus to make, to switch from being a duck virus to being a human virus. I think that’s pretty clear, but I certainly wouldn’t put money on the fact that it can’t make that leap,” said Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. “It’s going to take a little bit of the biologic stars aligning for that to happen. We could argue exactly how likely that is, but no one actually knows. Only time will tell us, unfortunately.”\n \n\n   \n  Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the ongoing outbreak, according to the CDC. One person died in January who was also elderly and had underlying conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.\n \n\n   \n  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington State Department of Health urges people cleaning up around bird feeders and other areas exposed to bird feces to wear gloves and disinfect the area with a mixture of one part bleach to 10 parts water or a commercial disinfectant like Lysol spray.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife. If disposing of a dead bird, wear a well-fitting face mask and disposable gloves, and use an inside-out plastic bag to pick up the carcass. The health department suggests double-bagging the bird and disposing of it in a sealed trash can so other animals don’t try to eat it. Wash hand thoroughly afterwards.\n \n\n   \n  Avoid consuming uncooked, undercooked or unpasteurized food like raw cheese or raw milk.\n \n\n   \n  The health department also recommends getting a flu shot. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/us/chicago-immigration-arrests-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"20:32:00-05:00","title":"Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Chicago Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant legal development, US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, nominated by former President Joe Biden, ruled that hundreds of people arrested during 'Operation Midway Blitz,' a federal immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas from June to October 2025, must be released.

Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Out of a list of the more than 600 detainees the Justice Department shared with the court, only 16 had explanations for why they were given an “ICE Further Designation of High Public Safety Risk.” The document indicates they were arrested for a range of charges, including for aggravated assault, DUI, domestic battery, and criminal conspiracy to traffic narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  The document also lists around 40 people as having a “high” risk to public safety designation – though officials do not provide the reasons why. CNN has reached out to Department of Homeland Security and DOJ attorneys for clarity.\n \n\n   \n  Two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”\n \n\n   \n  The list of detainees CNN reviewed showed that 75 people have already been “removed” and multiple others are listed as having been “paroled” or “bonded out.”\n \n\n   \n    What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.\n \n\n   \n  But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.\n \n\n   \n  “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n   “We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Bovino  left Chicago  Thursday morning with his CBP agents and  will head next to Charlotte , North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including  from a federal judge , for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin  previously told CNN , while  other immigration legal challenges  move through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago  amid protests against  the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Zoe Sottile, Dianne Gallagher and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/travel/thanksgiving-travel-government-shutdown-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"19:13:00Z","title":"The government shutdown is over.

over. Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:13 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when millions of Americans will head to airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history ended Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. The staffing shortages triggered a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order to reduce flights incrementally.\n \n\n   \n  Those FAA-mandated cuts to flights at 40 major airports, frozen at 6% since Wednesday night when the shutdown ended, will drop to 3% starting on Saturday, the Department of Transportation said.\n \n\n   \n  “The 3 percent reduction will remain in place while the FAA monitors system performance throughout the weekend and evaluates whether normal operations can resume,” the DOT said in a news release on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would “allow U.S. airlines to restore their operations ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday.”\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian feels optimistic about a swift recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the system should return to normal by the weekend. I really do,” Delta Air Lines CEO  Ed Bastian  told  “CBS Mornings” on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking charge in the face of uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of waiting to see how Thanksgiving could unfold isn’t for everyone. Some Americans have preemptively switched to Plan B to save themselves from the stress.\n \n\n   \n  Alexis Miller-Weissman, who lives in Seattle, bought Amtrak tickets last week as a contingency plan for the trip she’s taking with her husband and stepson to see her parents and other relatives in northern Nevada for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  That was before a deal started to take shape in Congress on Sunday. But after that news emerged, they decided to go ahead with the train journey from Seattle instead of braving the holiday week at SeaTac airport. She received a credit for their Alaska Airlines tickets, Miller-Weissman wrote in a message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train trip is “29+ hours worth of travel … but it’s scenic and calm.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Andy Rose, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/entertainment/greys-anatomy-james-pickens-jr-prostate-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:44:00-05:00","title":"‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Star James Pickens Jr. Opens Up About His Prostate Cancer Diagnosis, Touts Early Detection","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Pickens Jr., known for playing Dr. Richard Webber on 'Grey’s Anatomy,' reveals that he was diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer in 2024 after abnormal blood test results led to a urologist consultation.

Can It Keep Its Edge?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has demonstrated remarkable trade resilience by redirecting its exports from the United States to other global markets—such as the European Union, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America—in response to escalating US tariffs. Despite a 1% year-on-year contraction in exports in October 2025, overall Chinese exports grew by 5.3% due to significant gains in ASEAN (+14%), Africa (+26%), and the EU (+7%). This pivot was pre-planned through decades of infrastructure investment via the Belt and Road Initiative and supply chain offshoring to countries like Mexico and Southeast Asia. While China's dominance in green technologies—such as electric vehicles and solar panels—has fueled demand in developing nations, the shift has raised concerns in countries like Brazil and Southeast Asia about market flooding and lack of technology transfer.

tariffs. Can it keep its edge? \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, Joyce Jiang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:37 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As US duties on Chinese imports spun higher and higher earlier this year, Derek Wang braced for major disruption.\n \n\n   \n  With US orders ground to a halt, Wang, 36, who sells intelligent cookware out of southern China’s Guangdong province, looked elsewhere to fill the gap. After finding new buyers in Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and Cambodia, he learned what he describes as a key lesson: “Nothing is more important than the markets close to us.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories like Wang’s have played out across China’s vast economy where businesses, large and small, scrambled to fill the void after temporary triple-digit duties – and the threat of their return – upended Chinese exports to the world’s wealthiest market.\n \n\n   \n  The result has been a coup for China’s trade juggernaut.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of seeing exports falter on lost US business, the world’s largest manufacturer has driven them deeper into other markets around the world – building on the country’s global economic footprint and hedges companies made during Trump’s first trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The resilience gave Beijing confidence in its months-long negotiations with the US, which came to a head in October when leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met and agreed to a truce that whittles new tariffs on Chinese goods down to 20%.\n \n\n   \n  But the push also puts China on track to eclipse last year’s gaping nearly $1 trillion global trade surplus – a balance that’s irritated governments around the world and sparked Trump’s trade war in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  There were already questions about the sustainability of China’s export blitz before data released last week showed exports unexpectedly contracted by just over 1% year on year in October – the first downturn since February.\n \n\n   \n  Whether China can maintain its level of exports to the rest of the world – and expand back into the US market after the recent truce, is a consequential question for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues to struggle with lackluster demand from its own consumers, but doubles down on manufacturing as its economic cornerstone.\n \n\n   \n    China’s trade resilience\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, the shift in China’s export flows has been stark – and sent a clear message that, for China, the US is not irreplaceable.\n \n\n   \n  While exports to the US dropped nearly 18% in the first 10 months of this year versus that period in 2024, they were up more than 7% to the European Union, 14% to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and 26% to Africa, according to Chinese customs data released last week. Overall, exports rose 5.3%.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, that trade was buoyed by leaps in the export of machine tools, automobile parts and computer components. In Africa, construction machinery and green technologies have been key exports, analysts say, while parts of Latin America have seen significant growth in electric vehicles, chemical fertilizers and electronics, among other areas.\n \n\n   \n  This trade engine was humming before the start of the trade war.\n \n\n   \n  Already the world’s manufacturing superpower, China’s rapid climb to dominate green technologies like EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and solar panels, had driven up demand from countries looking to convert to renewable energy cheaply – and concern from those accusing China of unfair competition with subsidized products.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those goods – like EVs and solar panels – were already effectively barred from the US market by high tariffs put in place in recent years, and China’s exporters have been building out trade across developing markets.\n \n\n   \n  “(China) has prepared quite well for this,” said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at the MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t some miracle of foresight thinking to predict that the United States would escalate over time its trade and technology conflict with China, but China was (expanding markets) before the trade and tech war began, and ever since it’s started, that trend has really accelerated,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as many companies had to scramble to divert business from the US market in recent months, experts say the groundwork for the pivot was laid by Beijing’s decades-long push to build out its global economic footprint – expanding trade while also bankrolling ports, terminals and highways under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also relied on an earlier push from Chinese firms to move supply chains and production centers out of China to areas from Southeast Asia to Mexico – where goods are shipped from China to be fabricated or finished.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the key for the so-called resilience of Chinese exports,” said Yao Yang, dean of the Di-shui-hu Advanced Finance Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who noted these investments began during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Without those outbound investments, I don’t think that China can cope with the shock.”\n \n\n   \n    A two-way street?\n \n\n   \n  But Beijing’s trade resilience has also raised fears that a deluge of Chinese goods into other markets will wipe out domestic industries.\n \n\n   \n  Countries have been hitting back with probes on Chinese goods, with the US and India, as well as Mexico and Brazil, together raising 79 anti-dumping and countervailing probes against Chinese goods in the first half of this year – a significant uptick from recent years before 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also calls for exports or factory relocations to come alongside greater levels of local investment, knowledge transfer and more balanced trade.\n \n\n   \n  For some Latin American countries, “deindustrialization is a big problem when Chinese companies start to invest … because they bring just the assembly, they don’t do technology and knowledge transfer,” said Diego Rodriguez, logistics and industrial practice leader at Americas Market Intelligence, a research firm in Miami, noting countries like Brazil are pushing back against this.\n \n\n   \n  In Southeast Asia, the stronger flow of goods is a concern, according to Rebecca Sta Maria, former executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel as if we are being swamped. I remember one economy saying a ‘tsunami of Chinese goods coming into ASEAN.’ Of course that’s a concern to us,” said Sta Maria, now the director of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. But it wasn’t all negative, she added, because small and medium-sized businesses were using high-end components from China, making their products more competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “I know that the Chinese government has acknowledged (the concern) to some extent, so now it’s how do we manage this?”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing denies accusations that its goods are flooding markets. Its officials have instead taken Trump’s global trade shake-up as an opportunity to tout China as the reliable trade partner, while pledging to open its vast market wider to exporters and investors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Observers say some countries may also be unwilling to throw up barriers to China at a time when they are facing higher tariffs on their own goods into the US – that’s especially when there is true demand in many countries.\n \n\n   \n  In Africa, “it’s a two-way street,” said Capital Economics emerging market analyst David Omojomolo.\n \n\n   \n  “These countries (in Africa) want to industrialize… there’s a massive electricity gap across the continent – solar panels are cheap and China’s got overcapacity … they need to send them somewhere, so of course, Africa is going to benefit.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Getting squeezed’\n \n\n   \n  Even still, manufacturers across China have struggled to fill the hole left by the drop in US exports.\n \n\n   \n  Factory employees in recent months have described to CNN canceled shifts, mandatory furloughs and lost jobs as employers deciding to relocate out of China.\n \n\n   \n  Garment maker Zhang Peipei in Jiangxi province told CNN she has been able to keep her 20-year-old business afloat through smaller revenue streams coming from outside the US. But she says the unpredictable US tariff policies have already caused “serious and irreversible long-term impact” without clear alternatives.\n \n\n   \n  With her business now hanging on whether she can cut a deal with buyers in Mexico, Zhang said she didn’t feel “very confident,” even despite a potential return of some US business now, “since the US has been shaking up the foreign trade scene, the whole world is chaotic right now.”\n \n\n   \n  And there are questions about whether China’s robust trade data this year showed true demand or a short-term push to get goods out of the country to stockpile them or ship them to the US via a third country with lower tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  An analysis of US and Chinese trade data from April to July – including the height of the trade uncertainty – suggests that just less than a quarter of China’s trade diverted from the US was likely still ultimately ending up in the US, while the rest of the goods were finding alternative markets, according to Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the RAND China Research Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Still, l’m not all that confident that the final demand for all those (other) exports going to the Global South is actually going to be remaining in those countries,” he said, noting that exporters could also be building up offshore inventories as they waited to see how countries’ trade talks with the US played out.\n \n\n   \n  “The big caveat,” he added, is that “the margins of Chinese exporters are almost certainly getting squeezed … they’re maintaining high volumes in real terms, but they’re doing it by cutting prices.”\n \n\n   \n  The recent truce between Xi and Trump leaves tariffs on Chinese goods at around 47% on average, but could see the return of more US business.\n \n\n   \n  But as uncertainty remains across the global economy, a driving focus for those in China, both in the factories and the government, will be on expanding how much the country’s own consumers buy domestic-made goods.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the case for Wang, the cookware maker in Guangdong. Despite finding new clients outside the US, he is also making another pivot, directing more of his business to China’s domestic market, and less of it outside, he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/lower-tariffs-coffee-beef-bananas-produce","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"17:02:00Z","title":"Trump lowers tariffs on coffee, beef and fruits, as Americans’ concerns about affordability grow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on November 14, 2025, retroactively lowering tariffs on key agricultural imports such as coffee, beef, tomatoes, and bananas, effective from Thursday.

A combat vet and NPR reporter's bond points a way \n         By Quil Lawrence \n        \n           Sunday, November 16, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The first I saw of Dave Carlson was his back, in a prison jumpsuit on Sept. 3, 2015. Carlson had been calling me from the cellblock payphone for a few weeks for an  NPR story  about incarcerated combat veterans and PTSD. \"Jail is the least therapeutic atmosphere you could probably ever imagine,\" Carlson had told me over a scratchy phone line. \"You come in one way and you leave three times worse.\" Now I finally got a look at him, while the judge decided if Carlson could walk free — or stay locked up for up to six more years. He was 31, and the only Black man I remember seeing in that courtroom in Waukesha, Wisc. Nearly done with a four-year sentence for robberies and drug offenses, he was facing additional charges for crimes he'd committed inside prison. Carlson served two combat tours in Iraq, and none of his military buddies could make sense of how he'd wound up sitting in the dock. \"When it came to how to lead and how to represent yourself, David was definitely on the list of people that I held in an iconic standpoint,\" National Guard Sgt. David Rock told me that day. They had met in 2007 on Carlson's second deployment. Three other Iraq buddies filled a back row in the courtroom, along with Carlson's family. Their stories of his strengths and virtues, and Carlson's thoughtful interviews on the phone from jail just didn't square with the long rap sheet the judge was reading off: felony operating under the influence, felony bail jumping, battery by prisoner while incarcerated. \"So the maximum exposure here is 12 years today with six years of confinement,\" Judge Donald Hassin concluded. Hassin himself had served as well, in Vietnam, but it wasn't clear whether that was going to help or hurt Carlson's case. \" Mr. Carlson, this criminal justice system, frankly, has bent over backwards and going through a lot of hoops in an effort to maintain you in the community. And frankly, sir, the response to all that has not been good,\" the judge said. I was there in Waukesha to cover Carlson's sentencing as part of my first-ever domestic job as a reporter after covering wars in South America, Africa and then Afghanistan and Iraq for 15 years. I'd pitched NPR on beat following vets and the Department of Veterans Affairs as a new generation navigated the return to civilian life. But I'd had personal reasons too: I wasn't sure how to make a meaningful life back home after the urgency and all-consuming lifestyle of war reporting. Many veterans had the same question as I did: How do you get over war? Covering Dave Carlson's story would help provide an answer — but it would play out over 10 years of conversations, of dark difficult times and moments of remarkable triumph. Mentorship and moral injury Carlson grew up rough, around violence, drugs and prostitution in Minneapolis. \"My dad was a crackhead and a pimp,\" Carlson said \"Nothing but violence, guns, like all kinds of stuff like that, drug dealing.\" To impress his older brothers — his role models — Carlson had done a string of crimes. At 15 he'd been sentenced to juvenile detention and lived there until his grandparents adopted him and moved him up to Rice Lake, Wisc. Things turned around for a while. Carlson did well at school and sports and won a college scholarship. But on his own in college, drinking became a problem and he felt himself slipping. The military offered a way out, but the Army wouldn't take him because of his juvenile record. \"It was the National Guard recruiter who was the one that was willing to do the extra work to get me in,\" says Carlson. The country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, but a surge in military recruiting had run into the reality that the Iraq war would be long and bloody. Guard units started activating for year-long combat tours. That was fine with Carlson. \"I was like, I'm good at this. Like, I can do this, and I feel … a type of like purpose with this,\" he said. His Wisconsin National Guard unit arrived at a small base outside Dhuluiya, Iraq, in 2004, just as the war entered its bloodiest years. His unit got assigned to mostly standing in watchtowers and securing gates. But Carlson wanted to do more, and he started asking around the active duty army units to volunteer for patrol. \"I bounced around different squads, going out depending on my schedule. I would pull guard duty for like eight hours and then I would go on mission with them. Or I would get dropped off after a mission and then I'd go on guard duty,\" he said. One of the sergeants he'd ask to take him on missions was Alwyn Cashe. Cashe would later be recognized as one of the greatest heroes of the entire Iraq war. But at the time he was just the guy Carlson had to pester about going out on patrols. Carlson remembers himself as a \"snot-nosed\" private, sometimes waking-up Sgt. Cashe to ask for permission to go out. \"And he put up with it,\" Carlson said. Eventually, after Carlson had volunteered for enough extra work, and kept his cool through enough gunfire, the squad leaders started to invite him to come. \"I've felt like my entire life to anybody that accepts me, I just give a fierce loyalty to them. And so that was, it was like the best thing in the world,\" he said. Toward the end of his tour, though, a unit requested Carlson for a patrol and he heard his commanding officer say no — no more guardsmen for patrols. After a whole year, he just wanted to bring all his troops back to Wisconsin alive. That might sound reasonable to families back home, but not to Carlson. \"For you to make it home and be able to say that you brought everybody home, you're willing to deprive this other company?\" Carlson fumed, and felt he was being made to betray the soldiers he'd built a bond with. Days later, on Oct. 17, 2005, Sgt. Cashe got ambushed. The initial explosion disabled his Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and somehow soaked Cashe's uniform with diesel fuel. Pulling a soldier out of the burning vehicle , Cashe was set aflame. On fire, he returned to the Bradley again and again, hauling seven of his men out while bullets flew around him. Cashe boarded the medevac last. It took three weeks for him to die of the burns that covered his body. Years later  Cashe was finally recognized with the military's highest award  — one of only eight people to receive the Medal of Honor during the entire Iraq war, and the first Black recipient since Vietnam. But at the time, back in Dhuluiya, Iraq, all it meant to Dave Carlson was that he had failed to go on a mission where he might have helped — or even died in place of one of the other men. Carlson redeployed home to Wisconsin, haunted by nightmares. \"So I was just in a really bad head space. I think part of the nightmares were about the fact that there were people still over there dying. Every day I was tormented, feeling like a coward, just not feeling like it was right,\" he said. A second deployment to Iraq in 2007 assuaged his guilt but cemented what the VA would later diagnose as PTSD. Returning to civilian life Carlson fell into several years of drifting, sometimes homeless, racking up theft and drug charges. By 2012 he landed at a maximum security prison north of Milwaukee. God and the Devil in Solitary I started talking to Carlson by phone at the end of his nearly 4-year prison stint. We compared notes on our times in Iraq, and there was a lot of overlap. When he arrived on his first deployment, I'd been embedded with Marines in Fallujah to the southwest of him. Around when Cashe was ambushed I'd been embedded with Army Strykers to the north, in Mosul. Carlson opened up about some of the darkest days of his life there in prison. With his mind still tortured by PTSD, he'd gotten so angry and depressed that he had plotted a suicide attack against the prison guards. He planned to make a shank and then slice his own throat in front of the guards' window and bleed out, just to give them the sort of PTSD nightmares that tormented Carlson. He went back into combat mode, and devised military tactics for fighting in jail cells — like dropping a slick of baby oil in front of his cell door, so any assailant would slip on the way in. His violent behavior eventually got him put in solitary confinement. Alone, with nothing but the screaming and banging from other prisoners in solitary cells, Carlson said he hallucinated that the devil was locked in the hole with him. \"There's no TV, there's no radio, there's none, none of that stuff. And dealing with that was very hard for me. It really took me outta that hole and really a completely new perspective that I've never had once in my entire life,\" he said. \"It was either kill myself or, or come to God, basically,\" he told me from prison. He started reading the Bible and found comfort and meaning in Christianity, and a message that he needed to serve again. \"I think that for the chances that I've been given to even be worth it at this point, I need to go out and help others. I can't just go out and enjoy my life, I need to go out and selflessly pursue helping other people that are in my position. I feel like I can maybe help prevent them from going down the same road that I did,\" he said. Before he could do that, he needed to get out of prison. That's what he hoped was going to happen at that sentencing hearing in Waukesha. Judge Hassin thought otherwise. \"I'm looking at a fine young man sitting here in front of me today that I'm gonna end up putting in prison for a little bit,\" the judge said, \"The sentence today is two years on each count.\" At first that sounded like four more years in prison, and Carlson's Iraq buddies exchanged worried looks. But then the judge explained it was concurrent with time served, so Carlson would actually be out in a couple of months, with 12 years of extended supervision and 3 years of probation. \"I'm giving you the challenge, sir, of leaving the state prison system here in a fairly short period of time. But you know what? You can do it. You're very capable of it, Mr. Carlson. These guys behind you believe that you're capable of it today as well or they wouldn't be here, right?\" said the judge. Carlson quietly answered, \"Yes, sir.\" \"OK. So to them, you owe something too, right?\" said the judge. A few hours later on the jail payphone, Carlson was elated. \"At the end, he called me a fine young man, and honestly, it wouldn't have mattered what sentence he gave me. That meant that meant a lot to me. I think that through all of this, that's all I've been looking for is just for people to see that I've meant well, and that I went down the wrong road,\" Carlson said. A free man Dave Carlson walked out of jail, a free man, on Dec. 30, 2015. He moved into an apartment his grandma had rented for him, and hunkered down. I called him up two weeks after that, and he sounded a bit bewildered. \"It was like shell shock at first. The first couple days were really bad. It took about a week before I could get my bearings and stuff. Just trying to act like I'm back in the world and life is life now, you know?\" he told me. Even though Carlson had been stateside for seven years at this point, he'd been in prisons or institutions for much of that time. When I checked in on him again after a couple of months, he sounded better. He'd met a woman at one of the two gyms where he'd been teaching boxing. \"It's nothing super serious. We do a lot of workouts together and stuff,\" Carlson said. It would get serious though. \"I will never forget the day that he walked into this gym,\" remembers Alicia Carlson, who is now Dave's wife. She didn't like him at first, but he made an impression. \"He had on high-top Jordan tennis shoes, a sweat-like tracksuit and just serious, like the most serious person I've ever seen,\" she said. There was a stretch before I checked in with Carlson again. And things had changed. He and Alicia were married and had a baby boy. But they'd already been through a lot, and Carlson had slipped. Just as he and Alicia started their relationship, Dave Carlson's best friend from his criminal days was murdered. That, along with his continuing PTSD combat nightmares, was enough to knock Carlson off course. Alicia realized something was off one night when Dave decided he'd have a drink with dinner. \"I don't know if this is Pandora's box opening or what just happened,\" Alicia told me later. She said it led to many months of relapses. That's not uncommon for recovering addicts, but Carlson didn't have any leeway. He was still under supervision by the court, one drunken traffic stop away from getting hauled back to prison. Right after their baby was born, Dave plain disappeared. \"I had a brand new baby. He was completely out of his mind,\" said Alicia. Alicia finally tracked him down to a motel in a rough part of town. She found him, drunk and snorting cocaine off of a desk. \"I wanted to die,\" Dave remembers. \"I didn't want to take on the responsibility of being a dad. I knew that I was gonna suck at it and I was gonna teach my kids all kinds of bad s***. So maybe my dad, it was best that he was not in my life for the majority of it, because maybe I would've just been even worse off? And maybe I'm gonna do that to my kids.\" Alicia marched him to an inpatient rehab at the VA in St. Cloud, Minn. I was always hoping Carlson was going to make it. But by then I'd been reporting on veterans for six or seven years, and I'd seen lots of them fail. Suicide long ago outstripped combat as a killer. More than four times as many Iraq and Afghanistan war vets have  taken their own lives than  died in both wars. The stress often ricochetted on to military families and spouses, like Alicia. But she wasn't ready to give up on their marriage. \"It was like, I'm just gonna do whatever I need to. I want to get David back on the rails because I feel like if I can get him help — he has so much potential. This is just a part of his story. I believe that he has so much more to offer this world and he's here for a reason,\" Alicia said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Maybe it was holding his new baby in the peace and stability of the VA hospital. Maybe it was Alicia's dedication, or Dave's growing sense of serving God. Most likely all those things, but Dave Carlson finally found a way to turn all his anger and trauma and energy in a direction more suited for life outside of war.  \"There's a quote about 'I would rather be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war,\" he told me. \"It speaks to being able to defend yourself, to be able to do harm, but then having the discipline, having the empathy, having the compassion to not do it,\" he said. After Dave came home from rehab, Alicia said, little good things kept happening. She finished grad school, and they bought their first house with a VA home loan. \"And then he got into law school and that was just like, whoa, like I can't believe this is happening,\" she said. In those years our phone conversations got to be less like interviews, as we compared notes on becoming new fathers, and discussed the wars that were still ongoing. Carlson was one of the people I talked with after my close friend, NPR's photographer David Gilkey, died in a Taliban ambush in 2016. Carlson got it; he mostly just listened. Put to the test We kept checking in by phone, and then by Zoom, as big things happened in the world — a pandemic and racial justice protests. Carlson seemed to be on track. He and Alicia had a second baby — another boy. And they'd started a company to mentor troubled youth. Finding a new mission, and for veterans feeling a sense of service, is one of the best ways I've seen people get over war and PTSD. Carlson knew these kids looked up to him because he's strong, and because he'd fought at war. But he wanted to teach them a different lesson about fighting than the one he grew up with. \"I thought, then, that the value was the actual violence — being able to do that violence to other people. It just needed to be deserving people that you did the violence to, which is backwards. Now I fully believe and know that violence of any kind is wrong. It's the least effective way to do anything,\" Carlson said. Carlson was trying to live that way — a warrior in a garden. His work with troubled youth and other social services sometimes brought him into volatile situations though. That's what he described to me on a call in 2023. Driving home one evening, Carlson said he got a troubling message from a colleague who worked in domestic violence. A woman had texted her, saying that her husband planned to rape and kill her. The husband, a felon, had posted pictures of himself online with weapons. Carlson turned around and went to get his colleague, and they drove together to pick up the wife and her children. They planned not to go inside the house, especially since Carlson was still on probation. \"So we get to the front of the house. And there is a door open on the car, and no wife out there,\" Carlson said. His colleague jumped out of the car and ran into the house. \"I'm yelling at her like, stop, stop, stop!\" Carlson said. So much for the plan. \"And so I go in after. And I'm playing in my mind … like a flashback to Iraq. My brain is now processing this as if someone has just kicked the door, and I'm second-man-in,\" he said. In Iraq that had meant: one soldier kicks in the door, and the second-man runs into a dark, unknown house that might be full of armed men. Back then his mindset was kill or be killed. Now he was rushing into a domestic dispute in an American city. \"The wife is in the corner, like cowering in the corner. I get in between the wife and the husband,\" he said. The husband was a larger man, but Carlson rushed at him, hoping he wasn't armed. \"I grabbed the hand that I couldn't see any longer while at the same time grabbing his neck,\" said Carlson. They crashed down the hallway and rolled on to the floor. \"I think I put one leg around, like a hook in jiujitsu around his thigh, and I'm peeking around his head trying to see if there's anything in his hand,\" he said. Despite his memories of house-clearing in Iraq, Carlson wasn't having a PTSD flashback. He wasn't having a relapse. Instead he was keeping it together and using the skills learned as a soldier. The man's hand was empty. Carlson wrapped his giant arm into what's called a rear-naked choke hold. A nd then it was done. He told the husband to stay down, and he did. The wife and kids were safe. The police arrived, and Carlson told them he had been involved. He called his probation officer. He figured he was going to jail. \"I went straight to the gas station. I bought six hard boiled eggs. I ate six hard boiled eggs, went to the courthouse and then waited,\" he said. As an ex-con, he knew the drill. \"I thought for sure I was going to jail! You get hungry as hell in jail. So… fill up!\" he said with a laugh. This time when Carlson ended up before a judge though, he knew what to say. And he didn't go to jail. He went home and he kept on studying for his law degree. Then this past spring I called Dave Carlson not for an interview, but to plan a trip to go see him in Wisconsin for his law school graduation. Two questions I stopped by Carlson's house before graduation, with that same original question in mind: How do you get over war? When we sat down to talk, though, he surprised me with a question of his own: Why have you been interviewing me for the past 10 years? Somehow, even a decade in, I didn't have an articulate response. But Carlson knew the answer, and he told me. \"Your recovery depends on the person you work with, with their recovery,\" he said. It's a concept he learned from Alcoholic Anonymous. \"I think you're part of this, you're part of this network. The same way I'm a part of your recovery, you're part of my recovery.\" He's right. I went to war as a correspondent, not a soldier. But I spent 15 years reporting on senseless death and destruction, and I lost friends along the way. Talking to Dave Carlson and telling his story, and other veterans' stories on NPR was the best possible thing I could have done to move forward with my life. Doing that for all these years had helped me digest what we'd all been through, and slowly redefine myself with a new purpose back here at home. As for my question about how Carlson could get past the war, the answer seemed clear as we sat in his house in Eau Claire, big enough for his three boys to have their own bedrooms. He and Alicia seemed happy walking the kids to a playground just down the street. In my mind his odyssey is over, home at last. But that's not how he sees it. Carslon said he's still just keeping the wolves at bay. \"I mean honestly like, I don't think it's ever safe,\" he told me. \"But I think that if you can build the community that you have, the network that you have for support and that network is stable, I think maybe you can relax a certain amount. Because somebody's got your six, right?\" he said. \"Right now I think that I'm trying to tighten up my sector of fire. So that when I do relax, I can just enjoy those relationships and my family can thrive without there being some impending danger looming just ahead.\" I left his house in Eau Claire with a more tempered view. Still I hope that some day soon he'll be able to let his guard down, relax, and feel safe, maybe even a little proud. I just spoke to Dave Carlson last week, and he was at the courthouse again. He passed the bar, and he's now a practicing attorney. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Nov. 16th, 2025 \n         An earlier version of this story said Dave Carlson grew up in Milwaukee, when it should have read Minneapolis. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5610552","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"21:29:00-05:00","title":"In a shift, Trump says House Republicans should vote to release Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has urged House Republicans to vote in favor of releasing unclassified documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, calling the effort a 'Democrat Hoax' and asserting that the GOP has nothing to hide.

'not America first' in fight over MAGA \n         By Luke Garrett \n        \n           Updated Sunday, November 16, 2025 • 2:39 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., once one of President Trump's strongest supporters in Congress, called his foreign policies \"not America first positions\" and said his recent attacks against her can \"put my life in danger.\" Greene and Trump have traded barbs in last few days over the future of the Make America Great Again movement, raising new questions about the president's firm grip on the Republican Party.  On Friday, Trump  withdrew  his endorsement of the Georgia lawmaker calling her \"Wacky\" and claiming Greene's recent criticism of him was all about his refusal to support her future political ambitions. On Saturday, Trump called her a \"traitor\" in a social media  post.     \"He called me a traitor and that is so extremely wrong,\" Greene said during an interview on CNN's  State of The Union  with Dana Bash on Sunday. \"And those were the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When asked about her previous attacks against political opponents — such as in 2020 when she posted an image of a gun alongside a group of progressive Democratic congresswomen — Greene apologized.  \"I think that's fair criticism,\" Greene said. \"And I would like to say humbly I'm sorry for taking part and the toxic politics. It's very bad for our country.\" During the extensive interview, Greene also criticized Trump's recent defense of the H-1B visa program — which lets companies sponsor foreign-born workers for skilled labor. During a Tuesday Fox News interview, Trump said the U.S. has \"to bring this talent\" and he said the country doesn't have enough of it.  \"Those are not America first positions,\" Greene said on Sunday before voicing displeasure at his frequent foreign trips. \"And continuing to really travel all over the world doesn't help Americans back at home. I really — and I said this to him and I will say it out loud — I would love to see Air Force One be parked and stay home.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Despite her break with Trump, local GOP leadership in Georgia's 14th Congressional District are standing with Greene.  \"Recent national criticism directed at Congresswoman Greene does not change the fundamental truth that she serves at the direction of the people of this district,\" Chairman Jim Tully posted of  Facebook  Saturday. \"While the President of the United States represents the nation as a whole, Congresswoman Greene represents the people of Northwest Georgia, and she has done so with clarity, resolve, and integrity.\" This public rift between Greene and Trump marks a brewing fissure in the GOP. When asked what caused the break, Greene pointed to the battle over releasing documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  \"Unfortunately, it has all come down to the Epstein files, and that is shocking,\" Greene said.  The Georgia lawmaker said she doesn't believe Trump is implicated in these files. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the release of documents related to investigations of Epstein this week after enough members signed a discharge petition brought by Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.   On ABC News Sunday, Massie warned his fellow Republicans that voting against the release of the files would stain their long-term political futures — even if Trump attacks them in the short-term.   \"In 2030, he's not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles,\" Massie said. \"The record of this vote will last longer than Donald Trump's presidency.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00-05:00","title":"Tracking States’ Unprecedented Redistricting Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have initiated an unprecedented wave of politically motivated redistricting across multiple states in an effort to protect and expand their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

unprecedented redistricting efforts \n       \n  By Amy O’Kruk, Ethan Cohen, Renée Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  But not all states are agreeing to redraw their maps. The latest development is in Indiana, where the Republican leader of the state Senate  says there isn’t enough support  to redistrict in that state. Despite that announcement, Republican Gov. Mike Braun has continued to call for the legislature to vote on a new map.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, the Trump administration  sued California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609888","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:15:00-05:00","title":"USS Gerald Ford enters Caribbean Sea as threat of U.S. action against Venezuela rises","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The USS Gerald R.

says he’ll approve opioid settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue and Sackler family \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic.\n \n\n   \n  The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion and give up ownership. The new agreement replaces one the US Supreme Court  rejected  last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies that totaled about $50 billion. It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could “conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.” But without that possibility, he said: “The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.”\n \n\n   \n    The opposition is much quieter this time around\n \n\n   \n  The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.\n \n\n   \n  The US Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for  Sackler family members  to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don’t opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there’s been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn’t vote.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn’t bar prosecutors from pursuing.\n \n\n   \n  A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn’t enough.\n \n\n   \n  “The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.\n \n\n   \n    Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements\n \n\n   \n  A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There’s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven’t had a say.\n \n\n   \n  The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026.\n \n\n   \n  There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from  museums  and  universities .\n \n\n   \n  And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.\n \n\n   \n    Some people hurt by Purdue’s opioids would receive some money\n \n\n   \n  Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue’s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.\n \n\n   \n  All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. It would take up to 15 years for governments to receive their full allocations.\n \n\n   \n  About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue’s opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive.\n \n\n   \n  People will have until March 1 to agree not to sue the Sacklers and apply for the funds.\n \n\n   \n  One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn’t help people with substance use disorder.\n \n\n   \n  “Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can’t do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. “Some Sacklers are bad people,” he said, “but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic.

That was news to city officials \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:30 PM EST, Fri November 14, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcolm Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers  to head to Charlotte , then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  “As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans.\n \n\n   \n  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden – who initially was unaware of the operation – has been “contacted by two separate federal oﬃcials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week,” the sheriff’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office said details on the federal operation have not been shared with them and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The plans have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  US Rep. Alma Adams, whose district includes much of Charlotte, wrote she was “extremely concerned about the deployment of U.S. Border Patrol and ICE agents to Charlotte” in  a post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and what we have seen border patrol and ICE agents do in places like Chicago and Los Angeles – using excessive force in their operations and tear gassing peaceful protesters – threatens the wellbeing of the communities they enter,” Adams said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Bovino  wrote , “Immigrants rest assured, we have your back like we did in Chicago and Los Angeles,” and urged undocumented immigrants to  self-deport .\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are not involved in planning federal operations, nor have they been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in federal immigration operations and would only get involved when there are warrants or criminal behavior under its jurisdiction, so “people who need local law enforcement services should feel secure calling 911,” said Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, in a social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We still don’t know any details on where they may be operating and to what extent,” Lyles  said  Thursday. “I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Lyles asked residents to refrain from sharing unverified information about enforcement activities, which create “more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”\n \n\n   \n    Residents are already on edge\n \n\n   \n  Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which  deploys tactics  that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.\n \n\n   \n   Heavy-handed tactics , including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  Even though the federal government has not confirmed Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.\n \n\n   \n  “The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n  The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year, have created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990,  according to state data .\n \n\n   \n  “We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein encouraged residents who see inappropriate behavior to record it on their phones and notify local law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “We should all focus on and arrest violent criminals and drug traffickers. Unfortunately, that’s not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,” the governor said in a statement. “The vast majority of people they have detained have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    Local officials were in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out to the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”\n \n\n   \n  The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  “CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Why would CBP head to Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.\n \n\n   \n  And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.\n \n\n   \n  But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young Ukrainian refugee,  Iryna Zarutska , being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  posted  about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting a Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said  data  shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area  asked  the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.\n \n\n   \n  And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that  said  they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino  wrote. \n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n    What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?\n \n\n   \n  State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a formal designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff McFadden ended the county’s decade-long  287(g) partnership  with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an  outspoken opponent  of a  new state law  that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.\n \n\n   \n  In August, CNN  reported  that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5610485","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"20:13:00-05:00","title":"Hundreds of National Guard Troops Will Leave Portland and Chicago","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Defense Department is withdrawing hundreds of National Guard troops from Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois, amid ongoing legal battles and political controversy.

\n        \n      \n\n         The Defense Department is scaling back the number of federalized National Guard troops in Chicago and Portland, Ore., as weekslong court battles have stalled their

EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         SANTIAGO, Chile — This Sunday, Chileans head to the polls in a general election to vote for a new president, Senate and Congress. But four years after voting for leftwing former student leader  Gabriel Boric  to become the country's youngest ever president with a mandate to expand the welfare state in Chile, this race looks radically different. Security, immigration and unemployment are top of the agenda for voters. Three right-wing candidates are vying to join Communist Party politician Jeannette Jara, 51, the current frontrunner according to polls, in a likely runoff election to be held next month. Jara , who served as labour minister in Boric's government and is a former student and union leader, is promising to gradually introduce a minimum income of $780 per month, as well as cash transfers to workers, and subsidies for small businesses. She closed her campaign on Wednesday evening in an open square in a southern district of the capital, Santiago, where supermarket cashier Rosa Rivera watched Jara deliver her closing remarks alongside her husband from the back of the crowd. \"She doesn't promise things she can't achieve, which I think is a very responsible approach,\" she said. \"I believe she would be a good president for Chile.\" In the evening sunshine across town, 20-year-old medical student Alanis Ramírez explained why her vote was going to far-right Catholic father of nine  José Antonio Kast , before ducking into a cavernous concert venue to hear her candidate speak one final time before Sunday's vote. \"He knows what our country needs, and he has the experience to deliver it,\" she said. \"Chile needs an iron fist, because criminals have it too easy – I can't even go out in the street in my neighbourhood anymore because it's too dangerous.\" Inside the building, music blared and a handful of young people jumped up and down excitedly at the request of a DJ playing reggaeton, while lights strafed the crowd as it built up. When Kast finally spoke to the packed arena, his plans to tackle illegal migration, delivered to a backdrop of red, white and blue, the colours of Chile's flag, provided a spectacle with a distinctly Trumpian ring. Kast's hardline security and immigration policies have seen him praise El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, who has cracked down on gang violence in the Central American nation, and paint his potential administration as an \"emergency\" government. He is proposing to criminalize irregular migration, dig border ditches and build walls, and construct new high-security jails. President Boric has been lambasted by Chile's right wing, who blame his administration for disregarding security, which is perceived to have skyrocketed under his leadership. In October, 63% of Chilean respondents to an Ipsos survey said that their most pressing concern was crime – more even than respondents in Mexico or Colombia. But while homicides have dropped and Chile remains one of the safest countries in Latin America, violent crime rates have spiked for some specific offences such as kidnappings. Outflanking Kast even further to the right is 49-year-old YouTuber-turned libertarian congressman,  Johannes Kaiser , who is running for the presidency for the first time. At his own campaign closing event on Wednesday, a baying crowd was whipped up by Kaiser's vitriolic anti-communism and attacks on progressive values. In the crowd, some souvenir sellers sold pin badges with anti-communist messages and even mock ID cards with dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet's image. He has said that if elected, he would close the border with Bolivia to halt illegal migration, reduce the number of ministries from 25 to nine, deport undocumented migrants and their children, and withdraw Chile from international climate treaties and the regional human rights court. In 2021 as a congressman-elect, Kaiser questioned whether women should have the right to vote, and has consistently attacked what he refers to as \"gender ideology.\" A fourth rightwing candidate,  Evelyn Matthei , a long-term fixture on the traditional right wing of Chilean politics, has fallen precipitously in the polls as a more moderate alternative for the presidency. Matthei, like Kast and Kaiser, is of German descent. She even thanked Kaiser in German at the final televised debate a week before the election. Voting is mandatory in this election, meaning turnout will be significantly higher than in 2021. If no presidential candidate secures an absolute majority on Sunday, as is expected, the two leading contenders will head to a runoff on Dec. 14th. The new president will take office on March 11. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   On Sunday, Chileans will cast their ballots in the first round of a general election for president and Congress. It's a campaign that highlights the country's deep political polarization, and the alternatives in the presidential race could hardly be starker, as John Bartlett reports from the capital, Santiago. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting in non-English language). JOHN BARTLETT: In Chile right now, it feels like you can't turn a corner without running into a rally or campaign event. (CHEERING) BARTLETT: Eight presidential candidates, ranging from the far left to far right, are vying to lead Chile into a new era. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: Four years after winning on a social justice agenda, President Gabriel Boric is leaving office. But now, public security has become the focus of the campaigns. Leading the polls in this first round of voting is Jeannette Jara, a Communist Party politician and former Boric minister. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEANNETTE JARA: Viva Chile. (CHEERING) BARTLETT: Her program promises a minimum income of around $780 per month, cash transfers to workers and subsidies for small businesses. FLORENCIA VARAS: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: \"I feel like Jara is the candidate who is closest to the reality in Chile,\" Florencia Varas, a 23-year-old theater student, told me in the square in Maipu, a southern Santiago district. VARAS: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: \"Obviously, security is important, but I don't think everything they're saying is real. Chile is not a dangerous place.\" UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). (CHEERING) BARTLETT: But not everyone sees it that way. On the right, concerns over crime and migration are driving a surge that could shape December's runoff, with many voters likely uniting behind ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BARTLETT: Kast, the Catholic father of nine, was roundly defeated by Boric in 2021's presidential election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSE ANTONIO KAST: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: At his campaign's closing rally in a cavernous concert venue in Santiago, thousands wave red, white and blue Chilean flags, and music blared as Kast outlined his plans for building hundreds of miles of border walls - a spectacle that had a distinctly Trumpean (ph) ring. ROBERTO WEBER: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: Roberto Weber helped cofound Kast's Republican Party in 2017. He believes Chile's economy, security and health care can only be saved by Kast. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING) BARTLETT: The greatest challenge to Kast is coming from even further to the right. Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian YouTuber known for mocking the victims of Chile's dictatorship and questioning women's right to vote, has gained a following that could shape the final round of the campaign in December. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: At Kaiser's closing rally, supporters wrapped in Chile flags sported Make Chile Great Again caps... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHANNES KAISER: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: ...And others wore vicious anti-communist slogans on T-shirts and pins, while vendors sold mock ID cards featuring the image of Chile's former dictator, General Augusto Pinochet. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: One tattooed 26-year-old student, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution from the left, proudly explained that her anti-communist T-shirt, printed with the date of General Pinochet's coup d'etat, was a celebration of the freedom that his 17-year dictatorship brought Chile. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: (Speaking Spanish). BARTLETT: As the national anthem struck up behind us, she explained that she finds Kaiser the most sensible and straight talking of the candidates. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Singing in Spanish). BARTLETT: If no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote to win outright on Sunday, as is expected, a runoff will be held on the 14 of December, and the most likely outcome is that Chileans will be left with a stark choice between the Communist Party's Jara and one of her two far-right rivals. Whatever the result on Sunday, a choice between two drastically different visions for the future will face Chileans in the second round.

tree will cost more this year, thanks in part to tariffs \n         By Ayesha Rascoe, Eleana Tworek \n        \n           Sunday, November 16, 2025 • 7:49 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         According to the  American Christmas Tree Association , 83% of households who plan on displaying a Christmas tree in 2025 will choose an artificial one. But this year, not even holiday cheer is safe from economic tensions, as tariffs and supply chain pressures are pushing prices up. Mac Harman, founder and CEO of Balsam Hill, an artificial Christmas tree company, explains the increase will be noticeable. \"Whatever price point you might have been looking at last year, expect that to be about 10% to 15% more this year,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Nearly all artificial Christmas trees are imported from China. While Harman says that manufacturing costs remain steady, the price vendors pay to U.S. customs has increased, as a result of President Trump's ongoing tariffs on China. Trump often says his tariffs are intended to incentivize manufacturing on American soil. However, manufacturing domestically wouldn't be a simple switch for Harman and his team. \"The interesting thing about pre-lit artificial Christmas trees is they've never been made in the U.S.,\" Harman explains. Harman says it's a tedious process to attach the lights by hand like his company does – involving zip ties and painstaking attention to detail to ensure each bulb is perfectly placed – a task American workers rejected 30 years ago when prelit trees first hit the market. \"It's very unlikely that something almost like basket weaving is a trade that's going to move from a lower wage, lower cost of living country to the United States for the first time,\" Harman says. Other companies in the Christmas industry are facing the effects of tariffs too. Harman says many of his company's U.S. based suppliers, who purchase their component parts overseas, are also seeing higher costs too. \"The prices have gone up no matter if we make something here or if we make it in other places,\" he says. Harman has tried multiple strategies to keep Balsam Hill's prices competitive. Internally, he's made reductions to his workforce, paused hiring, and frozen raises. He's also diversified his supply chain, manufacturing trees in Mexico, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. Last year, when President Trump won the election, Harman pre-ordered his supply for Christmas 2025, almost a year in advance. \"We shipped as many products as we could between November and January 20th, Inauguration Day, because there was a lot of discussion that there was going to be a day one tariff,\" Harman says. Each time the administration lowered tariff rates this year, Harman restocked his supply – an option he fears may not be available to him next holiday season. For shoppers, his advice is simple: don't procrastinate. Because of the price increases, some retailers ordered less stock, raising the risk of mid-December shortages. \"Look for a tree that you love, and if it's on some kind of sale, buy it,\" Harman says. In past festive seasons, shoppers might have delayed in the hope of getting a bargain, but that might not be such a good idea this time around. \"Seeing if you might get 10% off if you wait two weeks, I don't think that's going to work as well this year as it might in a normal year,\" Harman says. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:   Now, it may be a little early to talk about Christmas, but I like to be organized, and that means thinking about my tree. According to a survey by the American Christmas Tree Association, more than 80% of households planning to put up a tree this year opt for an artificial one. But those trees, once seen as the cheaper, more convenient option, are getting more expensive as tariffs and higher production costs drive up prices. Mac Harman is the founder and CEO of Balsam Hill, which manufactures artificial Christmas trees, and he joins us now. Welcome to the program. MAC HARMAN: It's great to be here. RASCOE: Let's just start by comparing prices. And this is important to me 'cause I'm going to be buying a new artificial Christmas tree this year. How much did an artificial Christmas tree cost this time last year versus now? And I'm talking about for the average tree, not some huge, massive thing. HARMAN: What we've seen this year in the market is that prices have gone up about 10 to 15%, looking across the different retailers. RASCOE: And so help us understand, like, what part of production is most affected by tariffs? HARMAN: In the Christmas industry, 90% of Christmas decorations have been made in China historically. Because the products are made in Asia, there's really not been any increase in the manufacturing costs. It's just in the tariffs that we pay to the U.S. government to bring those goods into the United States. RASCOE: Could you move your production here so you wouldn't have that? HARMAN: We do source some products, not Christmas trees, but other Christmas products in the U.S., and that has been affected as well because our suppliers in the U.S. purchase component parts overseas, and those have been tariffed. So the prices have gone up, no matter if we make something here or we make it other places. That said, specific to China, we have been working over the last five or six years to diversify our supply chain and get outside of China. We've manufactured Christmas trees in Mexico. We've manufactured them in Indonesia and other places in Southeast Asia. But all of those places have been tariffed. RASCOE: OK. I know you said that even manufacturing here, you still have to deal with the component costs. Is there something specific about Christmas trees - why you wouldn't look to manufacture them in the U.S.? HARMAN: Yeah. The interesting thing about pre-lit artificial Christmas trees is they've actually never been made in the U.S., and the reason for that is because it's a really painstaking process, and we do it by using zip ties and clips and making sure the bulbs stick upright so they look great. And so back over 30 years ago, when unlit trees were made in the United States, someone had this great idea to pre-light the trees. The American workers, even 30 years ago, were like, no way. I am not doing this. I just think it's very unlikely that something that's almost like basket weaving is a trade that's going to move from a lower wage, lower cost-of-living country to the United States for the first time. RASCOE: Some companies have tried to eat the tariff cost, while others feel they have no choice but to raise prices. Has Balsam Hill done anything to try to combat raising its prices? HARMAN: We have done so many things to try and keep the prices as low as possible. And so unfortunately, we did do a reduction in force. We stopped a bunch of growth projects and reduced our hiring. We froze raises. So there's all sorts of things we did to reduce our expenses. We also negotiated with our suppliers and asked them to shoulder some of the cost of the tariffs. And then the biggest thing we were able to do was we brought in a lot of our product for Christmas '25 before the tariffs took effect or before higher tariffs took effect. That's not going to be a tool that's available to us for Christmas 2026. But for this year, as soon as President Trump won the election, we shipped as many products as we could between November and January 20 - Inauguration Day - because there was a lot of discussion that there was going to be a Day 1 tariff. RASCOE: What's your advice for families who want to get the most value out of their artificial Christmas tree this year? HARMAN: I think the best idea is to look for a tree that you love. And if you find it and it's on some kind of sale, I would buy it. I would not wait because I think we are going to see a shortage. Most retailers cut back the number of trees across the industry. The American Christmas Tree Association believes that 15% fewer trees were purchased this year by retailers than last year, and demand is generally pretty steady. With 15% fewer trees, I do think we're going to have reduced choice later in the season. I think kind of waiting and seeing if you might get 10% off if you wait two weeks, I don't think that's going to work as well this year as it might in a normal year. RASCOE: That's Mac Harman, CEO of Balsam Hill. Thank you so much for being with us. HARMAN: It's a pleasure. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609943","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"Trump Issues Two Pardons Related to Jan. 6 Investigation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump issued two pardons in connection with the investigation into the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.

       Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 8:26 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has issued two pardons related to the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, including for a woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents who were investigating a tip that she may have been at the Capitol, officials said Saturday. In a separate case, Trump issued a second pardon for a Jan. 6 defendant who had remained behind bars despite the sweeping grant of clemency for Capitol rioters because of a separate conviction for illegally possessing firearms. It's the latest example of Trump's willingness to use his constitutional authority to help supporters who were scrutinized as part of the Biden administration's massive Jan. 6 investigation that led to  charges against more than 1,500 defendants . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Suzanne Ellen Kaye was released last year after serving an 18-month sentence in her threats case. After FBI contacted her in 2021 about a tip indicating she may have been at the Capitol on Jan. 6, she posted a video on social media citing her Second Amendment right to carry a gun and she threatened to shoot agents if they came to her house. In court papers, prosecutors said her words \"were part of the ubiquity of violent political rhetoric that causes serious harm to our communities.\" An email seeking comment was sent to a lawyer for Kaye on Saturday. Kaye testified at trial that she didn't own any guns and didn't intend to threaten the FBI, according to court papers. She told authorities she was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and wasn't charged with any Capitol riot-related crimes. A White House official said Kaye suffers from \"stress-induced seizures,\" and experienced one when the jury read its verdict. The White House said this is \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\" The official requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the case. In a separate case, Trump pardoned  Daniel Edwin Wilson  of Louisville, Kentucky, who was under investigation for his role in the riot when authorities found six guns and roughly 4,800 rounds of ammunition in his home. Because of prior felony convictions, it was illegal for him to possess firearms. Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Trump's sweeping pardons for Jan. 6 rioters in January applied to other crimes discovered during the sprawling federal dragnet that began after the attack on the Capitol. The Trump-appointed federal judge who oversaw Wilson's case criticized the Justice Department earlier this year for arguing that the president's Jan. 6 pardons applied to Wilson's gun offense. Wilson, who had been scheduled to remain in prison until 2028, was released Friday evening following the pardon, his lawyer said on Saturday. \"We are grateful that President Trump has recognized the injustice in my client's case and granted him this pardon,\" attorney George Pallas said in an email. \"Mr. Wilson can now reunite with his family and begin rebuilding his life.\" The White House official said Saturday that \"because the search of Mr. Wilson's home was due to the events of January 6, and they should have never been there in the first place, President Trump is pardoning Mr. Wilson for the firearm issues.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Wilson had been sentenced in 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to impede or injure police officers and illegally possessing firearms at his home. Prosecutors had accused him of planning for the Jan. 6 riot for weeks and coming to Washington with the goal of stopping the peaceful transfer of power. Authorities said he communicated with members of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group and adherents of the antigovernment Three Percenters movement as he marched to the Capitol. Prosecutors cited messages they argued showed that Wilson's \"plans were for a broader American civil war.\" In one message on Nov. 9, 2020, he wrote: \"I'm willing to do whatever. Done made up my mind. I understand the tip of the spear will not be easy. I'm willing to sacrifice myself if necessary. Whether it means prison or death.\" Wilson said at his sentencing that he regretted entering the Capitol that day but \"got involved with good intentions.\" The Justice Department had initially argued in February that Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters on his first day back in the White House didn't extend to Wilson's gun crime. The department later changed its position, saying it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\" U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, criticized the department's evolving position and said it was \"extraordinary\" that prosecutors were seeking to argue that Trump's Jan. 6 pardons extended to illegal \"contraband\" found by investigators during searches related to the Jan. 6 cases. Politico first reported Wilson's pardon on Saturday.

Answering a question from an Associated Press journalist visiting Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered the most direct response yet from the Iranian government regarding its nuclear program following Israel and the United States' bombing its enrichment sites in June. \"There is no undeclared nuclear enrichment in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring\" of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Araghchi said. \"There is no enrichment right now because our facilities — our enrichment facilities — have been attacked.\" Asked what it would take for Iran to continue negotiations with the U.S. and others, Araghchi said that Iran's message on its nuclear program remains \"clear.\" \"Iran's right for enrichment, for peaceful use of nuclear technology, including enrichment, is undeniable,\" the foreign minister continued. \"We have this right and we continue to exercise that and we hope that the international community, including the United States, recognize our rights and understand that this is an inalienable right of Iran and we would never give up our rights.\" Iran's government issued a three-day visa for the AP reporter to attend a summit alongside other journalists from major British outlets and other media. Iran's Institute for Political and International Studies, affiliated with the country's Foreign Ministry, hosted the summit. Titled \"International Law Under Assault: Aggression and Self-Defense,\" the conference included papers by Iranian political analysts offering Tehran's view of the 12-day war in June, many seizing on comments from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz praising Israel for having done the \"dirty work\" in launching its attack. \"Iran's defensive response was remarkable, inspiring, historic and above all, pure,\" wrote Mohammad Kazem Sajjadpour, an international relations professor. \"How can one possibly compare Israel's dirty deeds to the noble and clean actions of the Iranian nation?\" Images of children killed by Israel during the war lined the walkway outside the summit, held inside the Martyr General Qassem Soleimani Building, named for the Revolutionary Guard expeditionary leader killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2020. But Iran finds itself in a difficult moment after the war. Israel decimated the country's air defense systems, potentially leaving the door open to further airstrikes as tensions remain high over Tehran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, economic pressures and societal change continues to challenge Iran's Shiite theocracy, which so far has held off on making decisions on whether to enforce its mandatory hijab laws or raise the price of government-subsidized gasoline, both of which have sparked nationwide protests in the past. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609876","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-05:00","title":"Judge indefinitely bars Trump from fining UC over alleged discrimination","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Rita Lin, has ruled that the Trump administration cannot fine or cut federal funding from the University of California (UC), including UCLA, over allegations of antisemitism or discrimination without providing notice to faculty, holding a hearing, or violating the First Amendment.

The administration has previously struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million. Lin cited declarations by UC faculty and staff that the administration's moves were prompting them to stop teaching or researching topics they were \"afraid were too 'left' or 'woke.'\" Her injunction also blocks the administration from \"conditioning the grant or continuance of federal funding on the UC's agreement to any measures that would violate the rights of Plaintiffs' members under the First Amendment.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She cited efforts to force the UCs to screen international students based on \"'anti-Western\" or \"'anti-American'\" views, restrict research and teaching, or adopt specific definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as examples of such measures.

Ford aircraft carrier is in the Caribbean. Here's its backstory \n         By Joe Hernandez \n        \n           Sunday, November 16, 2025 • 5:44 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The world's largest and most expensive aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command  announced Sunday  that the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group had made its way into the Caribbean Sea, with 4,000 sailors and \"dozens\" of military aircraft aboard the lead ship. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The strike group's deployment comes as the Trump administration continues to increase the pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, who was charged by U.S. prosecutors in 2020 with narco-terrorism and other crimes. In August, the Trump administration  upped the reward  for information leading to Maduro's arrest or conviction to $50 million. Meanwhile, the U.S.  has recently carried out 20 strikes  on boats near the country that American officials say were smuggling drugs, though the Trump administration  has yet to publicly provide any evidence  for those claims, and lawmakers and legal experts have indicated the strikes are likely illegal under U.S. and international law. Last week, Trump said \"I've sort of made up my mind\" on next steps for U.S. involvement in Venezuela, but he gave no further details, and other administration officials have shared little about what they are planning in the South American nation. Still, the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford signals continued escalation by the U.S. Here's what to know about the ship and its role in the Caribbean. The Ford only recently began operations The USS Gerald R. Ford is a relatively new addition to the Navy's fleet. The keel of the carrier was laid in 2009, a tradition marking the beginning of a new ship's construction, and the Ford was officially commissioned in 2017. It is named for the 38th U.S. President Gerald Ford, a Navy veteran who served on the USS Monterey light aircraft carrier during World War II. It wasn't until 2023 that the Ford left port on its first combat deployment, initially to participate in exercises with NATO allies. But the  carrier's deployment was extended  by more than two months after war broke out between Hamas and Israel, and the Ford was sent to the Mediterranean Sea to support Israel and prevent the conflict from escalating. The innovative ship's pricy construction was marred by delays The Ford is the inaugural ship of a new class of U.S. aircraft carriers that will replace the current Nimitz-class carriers, the first of which launched from a Newport News, Va., shipyard in 1972. Ford-class carriers  possess 23 technological advancements  for aircraft carriers, according to the Navy, including a new electromagnetic system for launching aircraft that replaces steam-powered catapults. The Ford-class ships are also expected to be able to operate with a crew 20% smaller than that of a Nimitz-class carrier. But the military  struggled to implement some of that new technology  on the Ford, resulting in construction delays. The Navy says the tab for building the Ford, the most advanced U.S. aircraft carrier in existence, topped $13 billion. Bryan Clark, a former naval officer with the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank,  told NPR  last year that Nimitz-class carriers cost a little over half that. \"So in retrospect, that extra investment was probably not worth it,\" he said. The delivery of the next Ford-class aircraft carrier — which will be known as the USS John F. Kennedy —  was recently delayed  by two years and is now not expected until early 2027. The Ford's role in the Caribbean Last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth  announced  that the U.S. would conduct Operation Southern Spear, a mission he said was to eliminate \"narco-terrorists\" and secure \"our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The massive build-up of American military might in the region, including the arrival of the Ford, is a part of that effort. Beyond the aircraft carrier itself, the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group contains nine carrier airwing squadrons, two Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers and an integrated air and missile defense command ship. The strike group's arrival adds to American military assets that had already been in the region, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and an embarked marine expeditionary unit. All told, there are now nearly a dozen Navy ships and roughly 12,000 sailors and Marines in the area,  according to The Associated Press . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5602335","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"06:01:00.000Z","title":"'We have no choice': Indigenous guards take on cocaine gangs in Peru's Amazon","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Peru's Amazon, Indigenous communities—particularly the Kakataibo—face escalating threats from drug traffickers and illegal loggers who are cultivating coca on ancestral lands.

on cocaine gangs in Peru's Amazon \n         By Simeon Tegel \n        \n           Updated Sunday, November 16, 2025 • 6:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         UCAYALI, Peru — As they patrol their ancestral territory deep in the Amazon, some of the members of the Kakataibo Indigenous Guard carry spears. Others wield machetes. Several have traditional bows and arrows and one has an ancient shotgun slung over his shoulder. Threading their way along overgrown paths and wading through rivers, the mission of this tightly-knit group of Indigenous villagers is deadly serious — to find illicit plantations of coca, the key ingredient in cocaine, on tribal land. \"We don't want it here,\" says one, who asks to go unnamed for fear of reprisals from the drug traffickers. \"Coca just brings trouble. It means death, for us and the forest.\" Cultivation of the Andean crop is booming here in Peru — the world's second-largest producer of cocaine. An increasing amount is now being grown in the Peruvian Amazon. It's a vast and often lawless frontier zone, larger than Texas. The region is also home to some of the last Indigenous hunter-gatherers on Earth, who still live cut off from the outside world. The number of hectares of coca in the South American nation rose from  nearly 43,000 (106,255 acres) in 2013  to  nearly 90,000 (more than 222,000 acres) in 2024 . The country now produces an estimated 850 tons of cocaine a year, production fueled by the global demand for the drug, including in the world's largest consumer market, the United States. Here in the lowland region of Ucayali, there are an estimated 12,000 hectares (nearly 30,000 acres) of coca as well as dozens of clandestine landing strips, including on titled Indigenous land and even within reserves for some of those extremely vulnerable isolated tribes. With the coca comes corruption, deforestation and bloodshed. In recent years, around 20 Indigenous leaders have been murdered in Peru for opposing the drug traffickers and illegal loggers who frequently work hand in hand with them. Six of them were Kakataibo, a small ethnic group whose several thousand members are spread out across the central Peruvian Amazon. The jungle heat actually results in a weaker, lower quality product than coca grown in the mountains. But it is also easier to smuggle the cocaine over Peru's long jungle border with Brazil and Bolivia than transport it over the Andes to Peru's Pacific ports and main international airport in Lima. Dirandro, Peru's specialist counternarcotics police, are struggling to keep up. Eradicating crops is like playing whack-a-mole in this sprawling jungle territory. Dirandro Commander David Mori Trigoso says his men work valiantly in difficult circumstances as he shows a cocaine press, used to make 1 kilogram (2.2 pound) bricks of the hard drug, seized in a recent operation. \"We're always pursuing the narcos but they also keep evolving,\" he adds. Eventually, after nearly two hours of bushwhacking, the Indigenous Guard comes to a series of verdant cliffs rising spectacularly out of the rainforest. This remote spot is not just where the Andes meets the Amazon but also the start of a government reserve for the last Kakataibo families still living in what anthropologists call \"voluntary isolation.\" They prefer that term over \"uncontacted.\" These Indigenous communities have consciously chosen to retreat deeper into the jungle because of past traumatic encounters with outsiders — including disease, massacres and enslavement. The Indigenous Guard launch a drone and within three minutes it has geolocated two separate fields of coca inside the reserve. They will now report this to the authorities. One woman tells NPR that the Kakataibo inside the reserve, who may be her distant relatives, are terrified by the drug traffickers. \"They're in their habitat but they feel invaded,\" she says. \"So, we have to always protect them.\" The danger is all-too real. Segundo Pino, the leader of the Kakataibo Indigenous Guard, points out a recent death threat he has received on his cellphone. In misspelt Spanish brimming with epithets, it promises that Pino and other Kakataibo leaders are going to \"fall one by one\" and that \"blood will be spilled.\" \"How do we defend ourselves?\" Pino asks. \"We've lost faith in our authorities. That's why we've set up the Indigenous Guard. We must defend ourselves. We have no choice.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609908","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"15:46:00-05:00","title":"A red meat allergy caused by ticks killed a N.J. man.

The findings, by researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, published in the  Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology . The report says a 47-year-old airplane pilot in New Jersey fell ill four hours after eating a hamburger at a barbecue in 2024. The man's son found him unconscious on the floor of a bathroom surrounded by vomit. The man was declared dead at a hospital. The autopsy cited a \"sudden unexplained death.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Two weeks before he died, the man had become ill several hours after eating a steak dinner, waking up with abdominal discomfort, writhing in pain, having diarrhea and vomiting. \"I thought I was going to die,\" he told his son. But the man and his wife decided not to consult a doctor, saying they weren't sure how to explain what had happened. A blood sample collected after the man's death showed he had an allergic reaction. His wife said that earlier that summer, he had 12 or 13 \"chigger,\" or tiny mite larvae, bites around his ankles that left itchy, small bumps. But scientists believe those bites were actually from larvae of lone star ticks, which can cause alpha-gal syndrome. What is alpha-gal syndrome? Alpha-gal syndrome is a tick-borne illness that causes a red meat allergy. Alpha-gal is a sugar molecule found in mammals like cows, pigs and lambs. It's also found in the saliva of some ticks. Humans don't produce the molecule so when a tick transmits it, alpha-gal can produce a hive-like rash or an anaphylactic reaction about 2-6 hours after a person consumes meat. \"It is like it is trying to fight off,\" said Saravanan Thangamani, who directs the SUNY Center for Vector-Borne Diseases at Upstate Medical University. \"It is a foreign body. But basically, as a result of that, we have this anaphylactic shock or allergy.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were more than 110,000 suspected cases identified between 2010 and 2022. But the CDC said the number of cases is likely higher, with as many as 450,000 people affected, as many people are unaware of the allergy and it requires a diagnostic test. In a  report  released in July 2023, the CDC said 42% of surveyed health care providers had never heard of the disease. The American Gastroenterological Association advises people with unexplained diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain to be tested for alpha-gal syndrome. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the U.S., alpha-gal syndrome is primarily associated with lone star ticks, according to the CDC. Most reported cases occur in the South, East and Central states, where lone star ticks are common. Thangamani, who runs the Upstate Tick Testing Laboratory in New York, said the number of lone star tick encounters this year in that state sent to his lab doubled from 2024. And he notes a trend of lone star ticks migrating north. \"In 2023, we received ticks from seven counties in New York State that are lone star tick encounters,\" Thangamani said. \"This year we got about 15 counties. In addition to increasing numbers, they're also expanding in geographic range, so this is a cause of concern.\" How can I protect myself? There is no vaccine to prevent alpha-gal syndrome. After infection, physicians recommend patients change their diet to avoid consuming meat such as beef, pork, lamb, venison, or rabbit.

SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: This is how one pro-Trump podcaster, Jon Herold, spoke about the new emails on his Rumble livestream on Wednesday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JON HEROLD: To me, these are nothingburgers, if they're even real. BOND: Herold gained an audience in the wake of the 2020 election for spreading QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories. For Brian Lupo, who, like Herold, broadcasts under the Badlands Media brand, the emails didn't exactly say nothing. Rather, he claimed this week, they show Trump was actually informing on Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN LUPO: My take on this is Epstein and Maxwell are trying to figure out who's a mole or a rat or an informant in their circle of friends. BOND: The White House has previously denied that Trump was an informant. Jeffrey Epstein looms large for many conspiracy theorists, including Qanon believers. He's seen as a prime example of the Satanic cabal of pedophiles they believe are entrenched among the world's most powerful people. And Qanon adherents think Donald Trump is destined to defeat that cabal. Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein were once friendly but fell out decades ago. He's denied any knowledge of Epstein's trafficking of underage girls. While one of the newly released emails suggest Trump did know about Epstein's behavior, and another called him a, quote, \"dog that hasn't barked,\" some right-wing media figures view this as proving Trump did nothing wrong. MIKE ROTHSCHILD: They're claiming it's a hoax. They're claiming that the Democrats are cherry-picking the things that make Trump look the worst and that he was actually gathering information for the FBI on Epstein. BOND: Mike Rothschild is an independent journalist who has written extensively about conspiracy theories and QAnon. He says, this is different than what many on the right have been saying for years. ROTHSCHILD: Which is that if we just bring down the Epstein ring, all of the Democrats are going to go down with him. BOND: Many prominent Democrats are shown communicating with Epstein in the emails. But another common thread on the right is that it's a distraction by the Democrats. Here's Vince Coglianese, editorial director of The Daily Caller, on his Rumble livestream Thursday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VINCE COGLIANESE: The Epstein thing, all it's really doing is exposing more Democrat failures. BOND: That echoes what President Trump himself has been posting on Truth Social, that Democrats are using Epstein to deflect from the shutdown. On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said a federal prosecutor would lead a probe into Democrats mentioned in the emails. Meanwhile, some prominent influencers and conservative media outlets are essentially ignoring the whole thing. Rothschild. ROTHSCHILD: They already know that their fans are on board, 100%, with whatever Trump does. There's nothing for them here. BOND: At the same time, he notes, the newest emails are fueling new speculation on both the right and the left. ROTHSCHILD: Jeffrey Epstein was, like, not the most trustworthy person. You're taking him at his word because you want to believe him when he says things that are either good about Trump or bad about Trump. BOND: Things people already want to believe.

Jon Hamilton \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 7:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A decades-long boom in brain science in the United States may be heading for a bust. Ongoing disruptions in federal funding are causing many young brain scientists to reconsider their career choice, according to leaders of the  Society for Neuroscience  (SfN), which represents more than 37,000 researchers and clinicians. If those scientists change fields or leave the country, SfN officials say, it could hobble the nation's efforts to understand and treat brain disorders including Alzheimer's, autism, Parkinson's and schizophrenia. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The U.S. has been a world leader in research for decades, and that leadership position is now at risk,\" says  John Morrison , a professor at the University of California, Davis and president of SfN. Morrison expects that discussions about federal funding are likely to have a prominent place in the group's annual five-day meeting, which begins Saturday in San Diego and is expected to attract about 20,000 brain scientists. \"It's hard to escape, because we're all being directly affected by it,\" Morrison says. Science, disrupted In the months since President Trump took office, the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation have been buffeted by cuts, grant terminations, and abrupt policy changes. Federal health officials have said those measures reflect an effort to reduce fraud and waste, end support of 'woke' science, and align research with the administration's priorities. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the process has been unsettling for young scientists like  Clara Zundel , a postdoctoral researcher at Wayne State University in Detroit. Zundel, who studies how pollution affects the developing brain, currently has funding from the National Institutes of Health. But consideration of an NIH grant that would extend her funding has been delayed, she says. As a result, she decided not to spend the money to attend this year's neuroscience meeting. Instead, she's focusing on finding a job in an increasingly tight market. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Many universities are still on partial or even full hiring freezes,\" Zundel says. \"So it's just made it really scary to think how I'm going to take that next step.\" Zundel isn't ready to abandon her career plans just yet. \"I absolutely love what I do, and I want to continue doing what I do,\" she says. Still. \"Talk to me in another three months,\" she says, \"and I might change my mind.\" Other young researchers are even less certain, Morrison says. \"You hear things like, 'I've prepared my whole life for this. Is it gone now? Is it no longer possible to be the scientist that I always wanted to be?'\" he says. \"Many will just choose something else.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Others may take their research to another country. And if funding cuts and uncertainty persist, Morrison says, the field of neuroscience could lose a whole generation of scientists. Congress funds, White House cuts    The NIH often awards five-year grants, and scientists tend to structure their research around that timeline. But in recent months, many grants have been paused or prematurely terminated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If you disrupt the grant in the middle, the work you've already done [may be] worthless,\" Morrison says. He also challenges the administration's claim that it is saving taxpayers' money. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the long run, he says, the human and financial costs of cutting research will be huge. Take Alzheimer's. Research into the neurodegenerative disorder costs the federal government a few billion dollars per year, Morrison says. But caring for people with the disease costs far more — hundreds of billions of dollars a year. And that cost, he says, will continue to rise until researchers find better treatments or a way to prevent the disease. Morrison says it's an excellent example of a principle expressed by the late  Mary Lasker , a philanthropist and champion of medical research, who famously said: \"If you think research is expensive, try disease.\" That sentiment is one reason brain science has long enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, says  Diane Lipscombe , a professor at Brown University and chair of the government and public affairs committee at the Society for Neuroscience. Another is that, ever since World War II, science has been a huge boost to the U.S. economy, she says. That's because publicly-funded research not only helps train future physicians and scientists, it leads to new drugs and medical devices, biotech companies that spin off from universities, and patents on vaccines, cancer treatments, and even gene-editing technology. \"I don't think we've ever talked with anyone in the [House] or Senate who disagreed with that,\" Lipscombe says. But the current round of cuts and disruptions have come from the executive branch, not Congress. So neuroscientists are taking their case directly to the public. The Society's website, for example, now includes  links  to videos of scientists explaining the work they do and why it matters. Lipscombe thinks that message will be heard. So when she talks to young scientists asking for career advice, she tries to offer an optimistic message. \"You just have to stay with what you love because things will get better,\" she says. At least, that's the hope. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5585941","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"16:04:00Z","title":"Alaska station that covered devastating storm cuts jobs","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Typhoon Halong devastated the Kwigillingok village in Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in November 2025, the public media station KYUK—long a vital source of local news and Yup'ik language programming—faced a devastating financial crisis.

Jeff Brady \n        \n           Friday, November 14, 2025 • 4:04 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         KWIGILLINGOK, Alaska – When the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit this Alaska Native village last month, Ryan David was at home with his four children. They felt the house shake in the wind, then as floodwaters came, the building floated away. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I yelled at my kids to get up and group up here, on the stairs, just in case we tip over,\" David said when he  talked with public broadcaster KYUK . He and his children were still trapped inside. David says the home stopped floating when it hit a bridge. He talked with a KYUK reporter as he waited for rescuers to arrive. A month later, as villages across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta clean up from the storm and make repairs, hundreds of residents remain evacuated to cities such as Anchorage and Bethel. Now they face another loss. One of the few sources of local news and native language programming — public radio and television station KYUK — has lost federal funding that was  up to 70% of its budget  and plans to make cuts in January. The station plans to severely cut staff and some programming as it tries to raise money to fill the budget gap. The broader public media landscape is also experiencing  a loss of federal funding , including at least some money for improving  emergency alert systems , as human-caused climate change from burning fossil fuels is heating the planet and  increasing risks from extreme weather . In remote villages KYUK is \"crucial\" KYUK broadcasts out of a small tan building at the base of a tall tower in Bethel, Alaska — about 400 miles west of Anchorage. Bethel is a hub community for  56 tribes spread across 48 communities . The station says its coverage area is about the size of Louisiana. KYUK has been on the air since 1971 and \"is a  Native American initiated public broadcasting  joint licensee\" — that means it has both a public radio and television stations. It also has a  digital news website  and serves a predominantly Yup'ik population of less than 30,000 people in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Many residents, especially elders, primarily speak the Yup'ik language Yugtun. \"It's very crucial to have that KYUK network,\" says Darrel John, a lifelong resident of Kwigillingok. He says the news in Yugtun is especially valuable. \"A lot of great advice we listen to from the elders… Any updates from any other communities — you know what to look out for — and the upcoming events.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Each weekday, as  Morning Edition  ends, there's local news and the weather forecast in Yugtun. \"Weather is definitely one of the things that KYUK focuses on because it's life or death,\" says Sage Smiley, KYUK news director. In a place where there are few roads, residents sometimes drive on frozen rivers and need to know where it's safe to do that. \"Getting from community to community in a boat, on a snow machine, in a bush plane, the weather matters almost more than anything else,\" Smiley says. When it became clear the remnants of Typhoon Halong were headed toward the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Smiley says reporters started including that in their reports to warn residents. She says fall storms and even flooding are common in the region, but Halong was different from most. \"This storm took a track that was unexpected, hit south of where it was expected to and in an area that was less prepared for the storm to hit,\" Smiley says. \"I think all of those factors went into what made it so devastating.\" Three people in Kwigillingok died because of the storm. Nearly every building in the village was damaged. Overall  more than 1,600 people were displaced , many of them evacuated in helicopters. Smiley also coaches the high school swim team and was at a meet in another city when the storm arrived. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I was working remotely from a minivan with the swim team while the rest of the [news] team was working on the ground here,\" Smiley says in the news department studio in Bethel. \"And we had collaborators in Anchorage who were helping draft scripts and call communities to figure out what was happening.\" That's part of being a news director at a small station, but soon KYUK will try to report the news with a third less staff, because in January Smiley's position will be among those cut. KYUK loses funding and makes cuts KYUK was already navigating a loss in funding  from the state of Alaska  when President Trump  targeted public media and Congress eliminated funding  this summer. It was a big hit to the station's finances because federal funding has been up the bulk of its budget. The federal money essentially paid for employee salaries and benefits. \"It's a little over $1 million that we're receiving each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our salaries and benefits in FY 25 [fiscal year 2025] was also a little over $1 million,\" says Kristin Hall, KYUK's general manager. The station had 10 full- time employees and 13 part-time or on-call workers, says Hall. \"Beginning in January, KYUK will transition to four full-time employees and ten part-time and on-call employees.\" In deciding where to make programming cuts, Hall says preserving Yup'ik language programs was a priority. A daily interview program,  Coffee at KYUK , will lose three episodes a week in English, but keep its weekly Yugtun episode. The station's technical director's hours will be cut from 40 to 10 hours a week, something Hall says she's particularly concerned about because that person trouble shoots engineering problems and helps the station manage power outages. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       To bring in more revenue, Hall says the station is applying for grants, trying to sell more underwriting announcements and will hold two pledge drives each year instead of just one. The station also expects to receive one-time funding through a Trump administration promise to provide  $9.4 million for tribal broadcasting . Hall says the station will re-evaluate in March 2026 whether the workload is sustainable for the smaller staff. So, more cuts could still come. \"My employment here was hanging on by a hair,\" says Sam Berlin, a long-time host of the Yugtun language talk show  Yuk to Yuk . \"But the people, God bless them, they got together and we raised over $100,000 with our fundraiser.\" Just before Typhoon Halong hit the region, KYUK raised the money during its  fall fundraiser . \"It was our most successful we have ever seen in the history of KYUK,\" Hall says. That helps, but doesn't fill the funding gap. Raising money in a region with fewer than 30,000 people and with a poverty rate that's  twice the national average  is difficult. Hall says many people live a subsistence lifestyle, which means they may not have money to give. \"The encouragement that we get from local folks aren't always in dollars,\" Hall says. She says one person baked blueberry muffins to support the fundraiser and someone else dropped off salmon strips. Hall says an elder came to the station, and in an act of generosity, poured out her purse on the break room table. \"And everything that fell out was less than $3. And she said, 'I want you to have it.' And it was literally everything in her purse.\" Hall says the station hopes its funding strategy will be enough to support the smaller team after January. If KYUK doesn't exist, there's no one else doing the station's level of journalism in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. \"In terms of local news and information, and especially local news and information in Yup'ik, No, there is no one else,\" Hall says.

Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no corporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted publicly. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Alaska Native communities are still cleaning up after Typhoon Halong devastated two villages last month. Hundreds are still evacuated, and now they face another loss. One of the few sources for local news and information, public radio and television station KYUK, says it plans to cut its staff and its programming. That's after President Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated money for public media, wiping out much of the station's funding. NPR's Jeff Brady has this story. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: When the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit the village of Kwigillingok on Alaska's rural southwest coast, David Ryan's (ph) house floated away with him and his four children inside. While waiting for rescuers, he talked on the phone with KYUK. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) RYAN DAVID: The flood lifted us up, and I didn't think it was going to happen. And I'm like, I yelled at my kids to get up and group up here on the stairs just in case we tip over. BRADY: The house did not tip over. It hit a bridge and stopped. About four dozen homes floated away like this in the storm, thankfully inland with the storm surge and not out to sea. In this isolated village with no roads to the outside world, all-terrain vehicles are how people get around. In Kwigillingok, KYUK is a crucial source of information, especially as a hotter climate from humans burning fossil fuels makes storms like Halong more intense. Lifelong resident Darrel John says the station's Yup'ik language programs are especially valuable. DARREL JOHN: A lot of great advices we listen to from the elders, any updates from any other communities, you know, what to look out for or any upcoming events. BRADY: Over more than 50 years, KYUK has become a connecting resource for this sparsely populated region, which is about the size of Louisiana. The station broadcasts from a small building at the base of a tall tower in the town of Bethel. Each weekday, as Morning Edition ends, there's local news and, very important in a place where people drive over frozen rivers in the winter, the weather forecast in the Yup'ik language. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Yup'ik). BRADY: KYUK was already navigating funding cuts from the state of Alaska when President Trump targeted public media and Congress eliminated funding this summer. KYUK General Manager Kristin Hall says federal money essentially paid for the staff. KRISTIN HALL, BYLINE: It's a little over $1 million that we were receiving each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our salaries and benefits in FY25 was also a little over $1 million. BRADY: Federal funding has been up to 70% of KYUK's budget. Hall says the station had 10 full-time employees, but after January, that'll be down to four. As the station transitions to more part-time and on-call workers, it's cutting a daily interview program to two days a week and may have to end other programs next year. HALL: Essentially, the news director position is being cut. BRADY: Sage Smiley is currently KYUK's full-time news director. She's also the local high school swim coach and was at a meet in another city when the remnants of Typhoon Halong arrived. SAGE SMILEY, BYLINE: I was working remotely from a minivan with the swim team while the rest of the team was working on the ground here, and we had collaborators in Anchorage who were helping draft scripts and call communities and figure out what was happening. BRADY: In January, Smiley says her hours will be reduced to about five per week, essentially cutting the newsroom staff by a third. The station has prioritized keeping Yup'ik language programs, such as the weekly talk show Yuk to Yuk with longtime host Sam Berlin. SAM BERLIN, BYLINE: My employment here was hanging on by a hair, but the people - God bless them - they got together. And we raised over 100,000 with our fundraiser. BRADY: That helps but doesn't fill the gap. Raising money in a region with fewer than 30,000 people and with a poverty rate that's twice the national average is difficult. The station is applying for grants, trying to sell more underwriting announcements and will hold more pledge drives. The station hopes that will raise enough to keep KYUK on the air with a smaller staff. Jeff Brady, NPR News, Bethel, Alaska.

Just ask Maine \n         By Kevin Miller \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         AUGUSTA, Maine — This week's  vote to end  the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along partisan lines. Yet the bill to reopen the government was reliant upon Democratic lawmakers of both chambers who joined Republicans, exposing rifts within the Democratic Party. That political divide was clearly evident in Maine's congressional delegation — and the  public's reaction to how they voted . \"Well, Angus really hurt us in Maine,\" said Donna Doucette who, like many folks in Maine, refers to Sen. Angus King by his first name. King — an independent who caucuses with Democrats — was among eight minority party senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen government. Doucette was one of about two dozen protesters holding signs along a busy street in Waterville on a recent cold and blustery November afternoon. The protesters, many of whom are part of the local Indivisible chapter, were opposed to the deal  ending the government shutdown . \"I've supported him from the beginning and I think he sold us out. Especially when I'm retired, still dealing with cancer — I don't need that now. Nor does my husband, who is even older than me,\" she said. As part of the deal, Senate Republicans promised a future vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. But critics say they betrayed the Democratic cause by failing to secure an actual extension of the tax credits that roughly 20 million ACA users rely upon to lower their premiums. Without congressional action, the average premium is  expected to more than double  after December 31st. Some protesters brought signs calling King a coward. Cindy Burke said he caved. \"We held out for 40 days, I think, and I just feel that we got nothing from it,\" said Burke. \"And a promise to have a vote on the ACA, I don't believe that is going to happen. I don't trust the Republicans.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A small delegation with a significant split  Maine's four-person congressional delegation is one of the smallest in the country. Yet their  mixed votes on the bill  to reopen the government reflect the national divide over the fraught issue. Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins blamed the shutdown on Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Yet as chairwoman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins  helped broker the compromise  that funds the government through January 30 and fully funds some agencies through September 30. Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, supported extending the ACA subsidies but blasted his party's shutdown strategy. He cast one of his party's six House votes to end the shutdown. His fellow Maine Democrat, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, views the compromise as a \"capitulation,\" particularly after the Democratic victories nationwide during the Nov. 4 election. \"Many of us felt like there was a lot of momentum behind us,\" said Pingree. \"And the Republicans are feeling these concerns. They are losing court battles and they are getting the same calls that we are. We should move them to a decision, not the promise of a vote.\" Angus King said in an interview with Maine Public Radio earlier this week that he's surprised by the  ferocity of the backlash , although he understands the sentiment. \"I understand because millions of people in this country are gravely worried and angry and frankly scared about the future of their country because of what Donald Trump is doing,\" King said. \"I'm with them. I've been to the 'No Kings' rallies here in Maine.\" But King defended his decision, saying Republicans made clear they would not negotiate on the ACA until the government reopened. Government shutdowns rarely secure policy concessions for the minority party. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Although he supports extending the subsidies, King said the shutdown harmed Americans — and empowered Trump. That's why King voted with Republicans more than a dozen times to avoid or end the shutdown. \"And I get it: people want some place to stand up and they felt this was it,\" King said. \"But it's backfiring in a sense that it is hurting a lot of people without getting what we want.\" Independents play a key role in upcoming elections It's unclear how shutdown partisanship will impact next year's elections in Maine — a state where  30 percent of voters  are independents. And Maine could play an outsized role in control of Congress after 2026. Golden isn't seeking reelection in a House district that Trump won twice, giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat. And the shutdown is already popping up in the heated Democratic primary to challenge Collins, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans. Collins has not yet announced that she is running for reelection, although she is aggressively fundraising. \"I want to reiterate my call for Leader Schumer to step down,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, a Marine Corps veteran and oysterman whose anti-establishment message has drawn huge crowds, despite recent controversy over past online comments and a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner has said  he didn't realize the connection  when he received the tattoo as a young infantryman and recently had it covered. Platner denounced the shutdown deal, blaming Schumer — who opposed the deal but couldn't keep his party unified against it. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate. \"The governor has Chuck Schumer's phone number. She should give him a call and have a chat about that.\" For her part, Mills said this week that she strongly disagrees with the deal to end the shutdown. \"I appreciate Senator King's efforts here, but it's not going to work,\" Mills said on MSNBC. \"The mere promise of taking it up, putting it on the calendar, talking about it in December . . . Maine people can't wait.\" Back in Waterville, protest organizer Karen Heck said she's frustrated — with King, with her Democratic Party and with politicians, in general. \"I just think that most people are tired of a government that doesn't work for them,\" Heck said. \"Whether that's a schism in the Democratic Party or not, I think that this old system, the old system is not working for us. And a lot of people are angry about that.\" Heck added that she thinks people will demand a change — possibly starting in next year's primaries. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   This week's vote to end the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along party lines, and it exposed rifts within the Democratic Party.

(SOUNDBITE OF STEVEN HENLEY JR.'S \"PLAY THE PUZZLE\") RASCOE: Joining us as always is Will Shortz. He's puzzle editor of The New York Times and Puzzlemaster of WEEKEND EDITION. How's it going, Will? WILL SHORTZ: I am excellent. How are you, Ayesha? RASCOE: I am good. Will, will you please remind us of last week's challenge? SHORTZ: Yes, it came from Mark Scott (ph) of Seattle. I said, think of a famous actress - first and last names. I said, interchange the first and last letters of those names, and say the result out loud. You'll get some advice on fermenting milk. What is it? Well, the actress is Drew Barrymore. If you switch those first two letters - first and last names - you find that you should brew dairy more. RASCOE: This must've been a tough one 'cause there were just under 250 correct entries. And this week's winner is Phil Feller (ph) of Durham, North Carolina - my hometown. Congratulations, Phil. PHIL FELLER: Thank you. RASCOE: All right. So how did you figure out this week's answer? FELLER: I wish that I could say I had a clever insight, but for this week's answer, I just brute-forced it and went through a list of actresses until the combination jumped out at me. RASCOE: Oh, wow. So how long have you been playing the Puzzle? FELLER: I go back to the postcard days. RASCOE: OK. Wonderful. And - but this is your first time winning? FELLER: It's my first time winning, but it's not the first time that I've had an answer mentioned on the air. RASCOE: Oh. FELLER: Ten years ago, I submitted an answer, and Will was kind enough to say that it was so clever, it just blew him away. RASCOE: Well, that's wonderful. So it sounds like you're definitely ready to play this puzzle. But I got to ask, are you ready to play the Puzzle? FELLER: I'm as ready as I'll ever be. RASCOE: You're definitely ready. OK. Take it away, Will. SHORTZ: All right. Phil and Ayesha, every answer today is a well-known brand name that's also the proper name of something else. For example, if I asked what brand name of an iced tea is also the name of a U.S. state, you would say Arizona. So here's your first one. What brand name of chocolate bar is also the name of a planet? FELLER: Mars. SHORTZ: That's right. Brand name of a vacuum cleaner that's also the name of a U.S. president. FELLER: Hoover. SHORTZ: Good job. How about a brand of paper towels that's also an historical ship? FELLER: Bounty. SHORTZ: That's it. A brand of cigarette that's also a state capital. FELLER: Marlboro. No. No. Yeah. No Marlboro state capital. SHORTZ: Nope, there's no state capital Marlboro. Think of the capital of Oregon. FELLER: Oh, Salem. SHORTZ: Salem is it. How about a brand of lock that's also a university. FELLER: Yale. SHORTZ: Yale is it. A brand of potato chips that's part of Massachusetts. FELLER: Potato chips part of Massachusetts. SHORTZ: And it's a part of Massachusetts that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean. FELLER: Cape Cod. SHORTZ: Cape Cod is it. Brand of ice cream bar that's part of Alaska and Northern Canada. FELLER: Klondike. SHORTZ: That's it. A brand of peanut butter that's also a classic children's book. FELLER: Peanut butter and classic children's book. Oh, Ayesha, have you gotten any ideas on this one? RASCOE: I think this is the one where they never grow up. SHORTZ: That's it. FELLER: Oh, Peter Pan, of course. SHORTZ: Peter Pan is it. A brand of bottled water that's also a South Seas island. FELLER: Fiji. SHORTZ: Uh-huh. A car model from Ford that's also a sign of the zodiac. FELLER: Car model from Ford. Taurus. SHORTZ: That's it. And here's your last one, a brand of drink mix that's also a Chinese dynasty. FELLER: Chinese dynasty drink mix. Tang. SHORTZ: Tang. Good job. RASCOE: You did a really wonderful job 'cause a lot of these I could not think of (laughter). So - but you did a wonderful job. How do you feel? FELLER: Relieved. RASCOE: (Laughter) For playing our Puzzle today, you'll get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin, as well as puzzle books and games. You can read all about it at /puzzle. And, Phil, what member station do you listen to? FELLER: I am a sustaining member of WUNC, and I'm also a longtime sustaining member of Minnesota Public Radio. RASCOE: That's Phil Feller of Durham, North Carolina. Thank you so much for playing the Puzzle. FELLER: Thank you. RASCOE: OK. Will, what's next week's challenge? SHORTZ: Yes. It comes from Dave Shukan (ph) of San Marino, California. Take the name of a famous person in American politics - six-letter first name and six-letter last name. Hidden in this name, reading from left to right but not in consecutive letters, is the name of a well-known place that's very dry in four letters. If you remove these letters, the remaining eight letters in order from left to right will name another well-known, very dry place. What politician is this? So again, a famous American politician - six, six. Hidden in this name, reading left to right, not consecutively in four letters, is a well-known dry place. Drop those letters and the remaining letters in order left or right will spell the name of another well-known dry place. What is it? RASCOE: When you have the answer, go to our website /puzzle. To submit your response, just fill out the form on the Puzzle page. Remember, just one entry, please. Our deadline for entries this week is Thursday, November 20, at 3 p.m. Eastern. Don't forget to include a phone number where we can reach you. If you're the winner, we'll give you a call, and if you pick up the phone, you'll get to play on the air with the puzzle editor of The New York Times and Puzzlemaster of WEEKEND EDITION, Will Shortz.

The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\" She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize  a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists , pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk. In  an interview with NPR in early October , Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes. \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\" Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\" Agriculture Department employee also on leave On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave. Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about food assistance programs in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.  \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\" MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity. A right to speak on matters of public concern Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest. She points to a  1968 Supreme Court decision  that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights. \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\" Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out. \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. And I was determined not to do that.\" NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this story. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:   Federal employees went back to work last week following the end of the government shutdown. But just hours later, one government scientist was told she was being put on leave until further notice. She believes it's retaliation for her criticism of President Trump. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: The morning after Congress voted to reopen the government, Jenna Norton returned to work at the National Institutes of Health. JENNA NORTON: At 7:15, at my normal time. HSU: She had a team meeting, caught up on some emails and then just after 2, a notice arrived from HR, informing her that she was being put on paid leave. Not for any disciplinary purpose, the notice said, but Norton strongly believes otherwise. She went on TikTok to explain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NORTON: I strongly suspect it is because I have been speaking up in my personal capacity about the harms that I've been witnessing inside the National Institutes of Health. HSU: Norton has been at NIH for more than a decade. She's been deeply alarmed by the funding cuts and the mass firings of staff at the agency this year. In public statements and media interviews, she warned that the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk. She spoke to NPR just after the shutdown began. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) NORTON: I feel like I have this front-row seat to the destruction of our democracy. You know, we are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public. HSU: The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a radical leftist. Now, there are a number of other civil servants who have likewise been sidelined after speaking out. Two government attorneys who enforced fair housing laws got termination notices after raising the alarm about the dismantling of their work, and Agriculture Department workers on leave facing termination after warning about disruptions to food assistance programs during the shutdown. Speaking on Friday, Jenna Norton says she knew she might face consequences eventually. NORTON: I was not totally caught off guard, but at the same time, I did not expect it to happen yesterday. HSU: Now, Norton believes her speech is protected under the First Amendment. She points to a 1968 Supreme Court decision that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as it doesn't disrupt government operations. She also knows federal employees have whistleblower rights. Still, she says she was never under the impression that her rights would be respected, given the tactics the Trump administration has used to shrink the government. But... NORTON: I also recognized that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. HSU: Something Jenna Norton says she's determined not to do.

Here's what you need to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history — lasting 43 days and ending on November 15, 2025 — concluded after eight moderate Democratic senators crossed the aisle and negotiated with Republican leaders to reopen the government. The shutdown was sparked by Democratic resistance to funding without extending health care subsidies, which would have increased costs for tens of millions of Americans. Though the final bill funds the government until January 30, 2026, with key programs like SNAP, WIC, and the VA funded until September 2026, it fails to include health care subsidy extensions. The compromise was driven by the belief that continued inaction would cause widespread public suffering. The shutdown elevated healthcare affordability as a central Democratic issue, giving the party a political advantage in upcoming elections. It also highlighted internal Republican divisions (e.g., McConnell vs. Paul on hemp) and the use of targeted funding (earmarks) to support local projects across states. Security funding for officials increased in response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The episode also advanced the Epstein files debate, with Adelita Grijalva’s support strengthening calls for transparency, though a full release remains unlikely. Federal workers' pay and furloughs were reversed, and flight delays began to ease. The article concludes that while Democrats frustrated their base, they gained strategic political leverage by making healthcare a central issue.","keyTakeAways":["The shutdown ended after 43 days, the

longest government shutdown in U.S. history is over. Here's what you need to know \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Saturday, November 15, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The government is back open. It was  the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 43 days . There are lots of questions about what this means, how we got here and where we go from here. Let's answer some: Why did it start? The Democratic base has been urging its leaders to show more fight. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught tremendous blowback in March for doing an about-face and going along with Republicans to keep the government open despite what the left saw as an odious spending bill. When the latest funding fight came up, Schumer this time showed a united front with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Arm in arm, they refused to go along with continuing to fund the government, and made the key issue extending health care subsidies, which, if not extended, would mean tens of millions of Americans would see their health care costs increased. How did it end? It ended without the health care extensions Democrats were fighting for. Eight moderate senators crossed the aisle and indicated Sunday night that they had struck a deal with Senate Republicans to reopen the government. The reason they didn't hold out longer, this group said, was because it was obvious President Trump and congressional Republicans weren't going to negotiate, and too many people were suffering. The Trump administration — correctly — gambled that enough Democrats would not be able to stomach the amount of pain the administration was willing to inflict on the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and more than 3 million federal workers. So what does the bill do? The bill  passed by Congress and signed by Trump  funds the government until Jan. 30 with carveouts for SNAP, benefits targeted at women, infants and children, or WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Congress. Those will all be funded until the end of September 2026. It notably also tries to rectify the firings and loss of pay to federal workers, although it's a leverage point the Trump administration could use again if the government were to shut down again after Jan. 30. There is also money for  increased security  for members of Congress, executive branch officials, judges and Supreme Court justices. Several Republican members were outspoken about this after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. If the government is only funded until Jan. 30, does that mean there could be another shutdown soon? It's possible. It depends on a few things. What lessons do Democrats take out of the shutdown? Does the fire within the base subside some between now and then? And is there an actual vote on health care subsidies? OK, so what about those health care subsidies? It's not clear yet, but the lack of a negotiation on them likely means they will expire unless enough moderate Republicans, feeling pressure in their districts, cross over to strike a deal with Democrat — and Republican leadership, including and especially Trump, go along with it. But that seems highly improbable — and tens of millions of people would see their premiums go up. If that's the case, what was the point of the shutdown? That's a question a lot of people, especially those left of center, are asking. They see what moderate Democrats did as caving to Republicans. The reality is, though, the 8 moderate senators, who caucus with Democrats and took this deal, didn't want to see regular people feel more unnecessary pain — and they saw no hope for Republicans to compromise after what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Democrats did accomplish something in this shutdown, though. They elevated the issue of health care, and if Republicans block the extension of subsidies, then they will likely own increased health care costs in voters' minds. What does this mean for federal workers and flight delays? Government workers will get back to work, and recent mass layoffs are to be reversed. Furloughed workers were missing paychecks. As far as airports, there are already signs of easing, but it will likely be several days or more until everything will get back to normal. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that more air traffic controllers are heading back to work, but in the very short term, flight reductions at some major airports will continue. Were there any surprises? Yes, there were a few. First, there's drama around a provision slipped in the bill that would allow senators to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 each, if they were subject to subpoenas or had their phone records accessed as a result of DOJ's Jan. 6 investigation. House Republicans pledged to pass a resolution repealing that provision, but there's no guarantee of that or that the Senate will go along. There was also a clash about hemp regulation between two Republican senators from the same state. The disagreement between Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul  got pretty heated . The bill also shines a light on  how hundreds of local projects are funded  — from the purchasing of equipment for a college in the Virgin Islands, the establishing of a veterinary doctorate program in Maryland, urban forest conservation in Texas and asbestos abatement in Alaska to funding for local hospitals, rural community facilities, youth centers, fire stations, and so, so much more. It's earmarks — funding not voted on or allocated through the formal appropriations process but tacked on in spending bills — that pay for all of these things. One day, there will be a vet that will say he or she got a degree from the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — and it'll all be because of the funding deal to reopen the government. Ah, democracy. Is there a guarantee on a health care vote? No. The moderate Senate Democrats, who crossed over to open the government, thought so, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said shortly after the deal was reached that he wouldn't commit to a vote. Whether the vote happens or not, if health care subsidies are not extended, it will be because of Republicans — and that will mean they will own higher health care costs heading into an election year. What does this mean for the Epstein files? The end of the shutdown meant the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election in Arizona replacing her late father. That's key because she signed onto a discharge petition trying to compel the Justice Department to release the files associated with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and her support gave a majority to those who want to see them released. Johnson, who is close to Trump, has argued compelling the release is not necessary — though the president has made clear he does not want them released in full and his Justice Department has not taken public steps to do so. Even if it passes, though, it will largely likely be symbolic. The Senate is unlikely to get the required 60 votes. Trump would, of course, like it to fail in the House. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of three Republicans who have also signed the discharge petition, met in the White House Situation Room, apparently about Epstein. Boebert did not remove her name even after the meeting. The day the shutdown ended, more investigative materials were released from the House Oversight Committee, including a leak from committee Democrats pointing specifically to emails from Epstein's estate, showing Epstein implying that Trump knew about the girls. Any day Trump is talking about Epstein is not a good day for the White House. Who winds up with the political advantage out of the shutdown? Democrats really upset their base — again. Progressives continue to feel like they get rolled by party leaders. At the end of the day, though, Democrats are likely the ones who got the most out of the shutdown and will have  the advantage in the midterm elections . Consider that Democrats are coming off huge wins across the country earlier this month in the off-year elections. The central issue in those elections was affordability. And through the shutdown, they elevated the issue of health care. The party and its candidates will likely be able to campaign on both of those issues next year, and with Republicans in charge, that will help Democrats — if they can mend fences with their base, that is. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-arrests-federal-agents-trump-0e143aa0161c998997e33fc1f52656d9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:12:19+00:00","title":"Trump Administration Launches Immigration Enforcement Surge in Charlotte, North Carolina","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration launched a targeted immigration enforcement campaign in Charlotte, North Carolina, under the name 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' citing sanctuary policies and public safety threats.

arrests in North Carolina’s largest city on Sunday as Charlotte residents reported encounters with federal immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores. The Trump administration has made the Democratic city of about 950,000 people its latest target for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime, despite fierce objections from local leaders and downtrending crime rates . Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a similar effort in Chicago, took to X to document a few of the more than 80 arrests he said agents had made. He also posted a highly-edited video of uniformed CBP officers handcuffing people. “From border towns to the Queen City, our agents go where the mission calls,” he posted on X, referring to Charlotte. The effort was dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web” as a play on the title of a famous children’s book that isn’t about North Carolina. Some welcomed the intervention, including Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby, who said in a post Saturday that the county GOP “stands with the rule of law — and with every Charlottean’s safety first.” Related Stories Indiana lawmaker who opposed Trump’s redistricting push is victim of a swatting 2 MIN READ Trump defends Tucker Carlson after interview with activist known for his antisemitic views 2 MIN READ Trump plans to meet with Mamdani, says he’ll ‘work something out’ with New York City’s mayor-elect 2 MIN READ Fear and many questions People rally against federal immigration enforcement after agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations across Charlotte. (AP video: Erik Verduzco) The flurry of activity prompted fear and questions, including where detainees would be held, how long the operation would last and what agents’ tactics — criticized elsewhere as aggressive and racist — would look like in North Carolina. On Saturday, at least one U.S. citizen said he was thrown to the ground and briefly detained. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on At Camino, a nonprofit group that offers services to Latino communities, some said they were too afraid to leave their homes to attend school, medical appointments or work. A dental clinic the group runs had nine cancellations on Friday, spokesperson Paola Garcia said. “Latinos love this country. They came here to escape socialism and communism, and they’re hard workers and people of faith,” Garcia said. “They love their family, and it’s just so sad to see that this community now has this target on their back.” Bovino’s operations in Chicago and Los Angeles triggered lawsuits over the use of force, including widespread deployment of chemical agents . Democratic leaders in both cities accused agents of inflaming community tensions. Federal agents fatally shot one suburban Chicago man during a traffic stop. Bovino, head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, and other Trump administration officials have called their tactics appropriate for growing threats on agents. Bovino posted pictures Sunday of people the Trump administration commonly dubs “criminal illegal aliens,” meaning people living in the U.S. without legal permission who allegedly have criminal records. That included one of a man with an alleged history of drunk driving convictions. “We arrested him, taking him off the streets of Charlotte so he can’t continue to ignore our laws and drive intoxicated on the same roads you and your loved ones are on,” Bovino said.

In the Chicago area, the agency only provided names and details on a handful of its more than 3,000 arrests in the region from September to last week. U.S. citizens were detained during several operations. Dozens of protesters were arrested. By Sunday, reports of CBP activity around Charlotte were “overwhelming” and difficult to quantify, Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said in an email. “The past two hours we’ve received countless reports of CBP activity at churches, apartment complexes and a hardware store,” he said. City council member-elect JD Mazuera Arias said federal agents appeared to be focused on churches and apartment buildings. “Houses of worship. I mean, that’s just awful,” he said. “These are sanctuaries for people who are looking for hope and faith in dark times like these and who no longer can feel safe because of the gross violation of people’s right to worship.” DHS says so-called sanctuary policy plays a role in Charlotte operation Two people were arrested during a small protest Sunday outside a DHS office in Charlotte and taken to a local FBI office, said Xavier T. de Janon, an attorney who was representing them. He said it remained unclear what charges they faced. DHS said it was focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents. Several county jails house immigrant arrestees and honor detainers, which allow jails to hold detainees for immigration officers to pick them up. But Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, does not. Also, the city’s police department does not help with immigration enforcement. DHS alleged that about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored, putting the public at risk. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ___ Tareen and Dale reported from Chicago.

NFL quarterback. In one half of action, the Cleveland Browns rookie showed he still faces a steep learning curve. The highly publicized son of Deion Sanders entered with 12:43 remaining in the third quarter against the Baltimore Ravens after Cleveland announced that Dillon Gabriel was being evaluated for a concussion. Gabriel was ruled out later in the quarter. Sanders completed his first two passes, but not much went right after that. He went 4 for 16 for 47 yards with an interception and was sacked twice, finishing with a 13.5 passer rating as the Ravens rallied for a 23-16 victory . “I don’t think I played good at all. They gave me an opportunity. I didn’t do up to my expectations to get us a win. I have to take it on the chin,” said Sanders, who also scrambled three times for 16 yards. With Sanders behind center, Cleveland gained 44 yards on 28 plays with four first downs in six second-half possessions, going three-and-out twice. “We trust our guys to perform. He’s no different, you know, and playing a backup quarterback role, as we’ve talked about over the years, that’s tough to come in there, but we trust him,” coach Kevin Stefanski said. “I know there’s things that he’s going to want to do better, but that’s why we work.” Related Stories Mark Andrews’ late TD lifts Ravens to 23-16 win over Browns and spoils Shedeur Sanders’ NFL debut 4 MIN READ Kevin Stefanski hints at Deshaun Watson’s return, adding further uncertainty to Browns’ QB situation 4 MIN READ Browns sticking with Dillon Gabriel over Shedeur Sanders at quarterback after loss to Jets 1 MIN READ Deion Sanders, a Pro Football Hall of Famer who coached Shedeur in college at Jackson State and Colorado, was quiet on social media Sunday night after his son’s debut. Sanders became Cleveland’s backup behind fellow rookie Gabriel after Joe Flacco was traded to the Cincinnati Bengals on Oct. 7. However, Sunday was the first time he led the huddle with the first-team offense or threw passes to Jerry Jeudy, Harold Fannin Jr. and Cedric Tillman. “I think I have heard his cadence like two or three times. I think going out of halftime, we all got on the line, and he said his cadence and we kind of got through it,” guard Wyatt Teller said. “Again, a lot of learning, but he played his heart off, put his heart out.” On his first snap, Sanders threw a 5-yard pass to Tillman. He completed both of his passes for 12 yards on his first drive but struggled with his footwork. He was sacked for an 11-yard loss by Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton and fumbled, with Teller recovering. Sanders threw his first interception on his second series. On third-and-10 at the Browns 17, Ravens linebacker Kyle Van Noy got pressure up the middle and hammered Sanders as he released the ball. The throw was off target and picked off at the 30 by Nate Wiggins, who returned it 14 yards. There was a four-series stretch where Sanders was 0 of 7 with an interception and took a sack. After Mark Andrews’ 35-yard touchdown run with 2:31 remaining put the Ravens on top, Sanders tried to lead a tying drive. He completed a 25-yard pass to Fannin on the first play. Three plays later, he connected with Jeudy for 10 yards to the Ravens 30. Sanders and the Browns drove to the Ravens 25 before the drive stalled. Sanders’ final pass intended for tight end David Njoku on fourth-and-5 was short as the Browns (2-8) dropped their third straight. Sanders did take one shot at the end zone on second-and-5, but missed a throw to Isaiah Bond. “He just kind of got thrown out there but I think he handled it well. We know what type of player he is and it was good to see him out there,” Tillman said. Ravens coach John Harbaugh said his team didn’t deviate much from its plan when Sanders came in, although they blitzed more often in an attempt to rattle him. “The game plan was going to be good for their offensive system and what they’re doing. We were not going to change that,” he said. “You don’t know how the quarterback’s going to look exactly, but you just have to take care of your own business.” A fifth-round pick by the Browns after some projected him to go in the first round, Sanders was inactive for Cleveland’s first five games as the emergency third quarterback after going 17 of 29 for 152 yards and two touchdowns in two preseason games. Sanders should get his first extensive practice with the first-team offense this week, depending on how long Gabriel remains in the concussion protocol. Stefanski said Sanders would get his first NFL start next Sunday at Las Vegas if Gabriel can’t play. Gabriel completed 7 of 10 passes for 68 yards in the first half in his sixth NFL start. The Browns have lost three straight. “I think it’s a lot of things, you know, we need to look at, during the week and go and just get comfortable, even throwing routes, you know, with Jerry (Jeudy) and throwing routes with all those guys,” Sanders said. “So I think that was my first ball to him all year. But other than that, I just think overall we just got to go next week and understand so then we have a week to prepare stuff I like to do.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/philippines-flood-control-corruption-protests-d390012c4eb5c37fc906b4fdc53e14fb","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"05:51:48+00:00","title":"Mass Anti-Corruption Rally in Philippines Demands Accountability for Flood Control Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the Philippines, hundreds of thousands of citizens, including a large segment of the influential Iglesia Ni Cristo, have protested against a major flood control corruption scandal involving powerful political figures and government agencies.

Various groups have protested in recent months following the discovery that thousands of flood defense projects across one of the world’s most typhoon-prone countries were substandard, incomplete or simply did not exist. Government engineers, public works officials and construction company executives have testified under oath in hearings by the Senate and a fact-finding commission that members of Congress and officials at the Department of Public Works and Highways took kickbacks from construction companies to help them win lucrative contracts and avoid accountability. Most denied the allegations. About 650,000 members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo, or Church of Christ, joined the start of the three-day rally Sunday in Manila’s Rizal Park despite intermittent rains, police said. Many wore white shirts and carried anti-corruption placards. About 2,000 people, including retired generals, held a separate anti-corruption protest late Sunday at the “People Power” monument in suburban Quezon city.

The police, backed by the military, went on full alert and deployed thousands of personnel to secure the weekend rallies, which were peaceful, Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said. During a Sept. 21 anti-corruption demonstration , a few hundred black-clad protesters threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at police near the presidential palace in Manila, injuring more than 100 officers. Criminal complaints have been filed against 97 protesters. The presidential palace went on security lockdown over the weekend, with major access roads barricaded by anti-riot police, cargo containers and barbed wires. National police chief Lt. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. ordered law enforcement to exercise “maximum tolerance” in Sunday’s rallies. Marcos promises action Flood control is an especially sensitive issue in the Philippines, one of the Asian countries most prone to deadly typhoons, flooding and extreme weather. Two typhoons left at least 259 dead this month, mostly from flash floods and landslides, and affected millions of others. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been trying to quell public outrage and street protests sparked by the scandal, saying on Thursday that many of the powerful senators, members of Congress and wealthy businesspeople who were implicated would be in jail by Christmas. Marcos said an independent fact-finding commission he created has already filed criminal complaints for graft , corruption and plunder against 37 suspects. Criminal complaints have also been filed against 86 construction company executives and nine government officials for allegedly evading nearly 9 billion pesos ($152 million) in taxes. Among those accused are lawmakers opposed to and allied with Marcos, including former House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president’s cousin and a key ally; and former Senate President Chiz Escudero. Both have denied any wrongdoing. Sen. Bong Go, a key ally of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has also been accused of involvement in corruption in flood control and other infrastructure projects. He has denied the allegations. Duterte, a harsh Marcos critic, was detained by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands in March on charges of crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drugs crackdowns. His daughter, the current vice president, said Marcos should also be held accountable and jailed for approving the 2025 national budget, which appropriated billions for flood control projects. There have been isolated calls, including by some Duterte supporters, for the military to withdraw its backing for Marcos, but Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. has repeatedly rejected the idea. “With full conviction, I assure the public that the armed forces will not engage in any action that violates the Constitution,” Brawner said. “Not today, not tomorrow and certainly not under my watch.” ___ Aaron Favila in Manila, Philippines contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/rajamouli-varanasi-movie-tollywood-17b96848fbd8a5551ca7066d75c227af","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"18:53:16+00:00","title":"S.S.

The whole of India will be proud of us.” Thousands of frenzied fans watched the film’s first glimpse on a mammoth 110-by-130-foot (33.5-by-39.5-meter) screen flanked by replicas of Varanasi city. A display of colorful lights and dazzling fireworks lit up the venue as crowds danced to the foot-tapping tunes of Telugu music — a mix of new songs and classics — turning the event into a vibrant festival.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The Telugu-language film industry has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood with its high-octane and sometimes logic-defying action, mythic storylines and grand visual style. And much of Tollywood’s recent success — critical and box office — has been credited to Rajamouli, whose larger-than-life heroes and ambitious filmmaking with imaginative visual effects have catapulted the film industry onto the global stage. Rajamouli became an international name after “RRR,” or “Rise, Roar, Revolt,” his 2022 three-hour, Telugu-language epic set in British India. The sprawling anti-colonial tale became one of India’s biggest hits, turned into a global streaming phenomenon, and won an Oscar for best original song . His two-part “Baahubali” series, released in 2015 and 2017, broke box-office records in India and introduced Western audiences to the visual grandeur of Telugu cinema. A reedited version combining the two parts, “Baahubali: The Epic,” released in cinemas worldwide just last month. Many Tollywood film fans traveled from faraway towns and villages to watch Babu, who commands a near-godlike following among them. “It’s not actually Tollywood now, it’s global now,” said Manideep Rayudu, a fan. “Our superstar Mahesh Babu is not a regional star anymore.

to find immigration agents that have repeatedly targeted his largely Mexican neighborhood. Wearing an orange whistle around his neck, the activist broadcasts his plans on Facebook. “We don’t know if they’re going to come back. All we know is we’ve got to get ready,” he tells thousands of followers. “Give us any tips if you see any suspicious cars.” Moments later, his phone buzzes. As an unprecedented immigration crackdown enters a third month, a growing number of Chicago residents are fighting back against what they deem a racist and aggressive overreach of the federal government. The Democratic stronghold’s response has tapped established activists and everyday residents from wealthy suburbs to working class neighborhoods. They say their efforts — community patrols, rapid responders , school escorts, vendor buyouts , honking horns and blowing whistles — are a uniquely Chicago response that other cities President Donald Trump has targeted for federal intervention want to model.

Enriquez is credited with being among the first to introduce the concept. For months Little Village residents have used them to broadcast the persistent presence of immigration agents. Furious blasts both warn and attract observers who record video or criticize agents. Arrests, often referred to as kidnappings because many agents cover their faces, draw increasingly agitated crowds. Immigration agents have responded aggressively. Officers fatally shot one man during a traffic stop, while other agents use tear gas, rubber bullets and physical force . In early November, Chicago police were called to investigate shots fired at agents. No one was injured. Activists say they discourage violence. “We don’t have guns. All we have is a whistle,” Enriquez said. “That has become a method that has saved people from being kidnapped and unlawful arrest.” By October, neighborhoods citywide were hosting so-called “Whistlemania” events to pack the brightly colored devices for distribution through businesses and free book hutches. “They want that orange whistle,” said Gabe Gonzalez, an activist. “They want to nod to each other in the street and know they are part of this movement.” Baltazar Enriquez, president of the Little Village Community Council, shakes hands with a local resident while patrolling for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

Many also credit the grassroots nature of the resistance to Chicago’s long history of community and union organizing. Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan said Chicago area residents were so familiar with their rights that making arrests during a different operation this year was difficult. So when hundreds of federal agents arrived in September, activists poured energy into an emergency hotline that dispatches response teams to gather intel, including names of those detained. Volunteers would also circulate videos online, warn of reoccurring license plates or follow agents’ cars while honking horns. Protests have also cropped up quickly. Recently, high school students have launched walkouts. Delilah Hernandez, 16, was among dozens from Farragut Career Academy who protested on a school day.She held a sign with the Constitution’s preamble as she walked in Little Village. She knows many people with detained relatives. “There is so much going on,” she said. “You feel it.” A difficult environment More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested during the so-called “ Operation Midway Blitz.” Dozens of U.S. citizens and protesters have been arrested with charges ranging from resisting arrest to conspiring to impede an officer. The Department of Homeland Security defends the operation, alleging officers face hostile crowds as they pursue violent criminals. Gregory Bovino , the Border Patrol commander who’s brought controversial tactics from operations in Los Angeles, called Chicago a “very non permissive environment.” He blamed sanctuary protections and elected leaders and defended agents’ actions, which are the subject of lawsuits . But the operation’s intensity could subside soon. Bovino told The Associated Press this month that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will target other cities. He didn’t elaborate, but Homeland Security officials confirmed Saturday that an immigration enforcement surge had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina . DHS, which oversees CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said operations won’t end in Chicago. Interest nationwide Alonso Zaragoza, with a neighborhood organization in the heavily immigrant Belmont Cragin, has printed hundreds of “No ICE” posters for businesses. Organizers in Oregon and Missouri have asked for advice. “It’s become a model for other cities,” Zaragoza said. “We’re building leaders in our community who are teaching others.” Baltazar Enriquez, president of the Little Village Community Council, hugs a community member while walking with a Chicago Public School’s student walkout in protest against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents around Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

(AP) — Josh Allen wasn’t in an I-told-you-so mood after he threw three touchdown passes and ran for three scores. Following a few clunkers, Allen led the Buffalo Bills to a season high in points in Sunday’s 44-32 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — and afterward, he refused to fall into the trap of riding emotional peaks and valleys. “Starting off 4-0 and we’re the best team in the world. And we lose two in a row and now we’re the worst team in the world,” Allen said. “We don’t want to ride that. We want to stay here, stay consistent.” Either way, Allen brought the Bills’ offense out of a monthlong slump, overcame what he called a “boneheaded” interception on his second snap, and added another extraordinary stat line to a career full of them. Allen became the first NFL’s first player with two games of three TDs passing and rushing. He did it last year in a 44-42 loss at the Los Angeles Rams. He also upped his career total to 290 touchdowns, the most by a quarterback before turning 30 — passing Peyton Manning’s 288. The reigning MVP did it this time with a retooled receiving group that featured Gabe Davis and Mecole Hardman making their season debuts. And Allen outdueled fellow 2018 first-round draft pick Baker Mayfield in a back-and-forth game that featured nine lead changes. Related Stories Forget winning the AFC West.

His three TD passes went for 25 yards or longer, including a perfectly placed 43-yard deep ball that Tyrell Shavers hauled in while tumbling into the end zone. And the dual-threat quarterback used his legs to score three times. The last was a 9-yard run in which Buffalo’s offensive linemen shoved him the final 2 yards to seal the victory with 2:35 remaining. “High-level competition, two great quarterbacks, two great teams,” coach Sean McDermott said. “Fun, yeah. My heart could have used a little bit different type of game,” he added. “This win right here showed me how tough we are.” McDermott also sent a message to his team by deactivating receiver Keon Coleman for being late to a meeting. It’s the second time this season and third time in Coleman’s career he’s faced team discipline, which was previously limited to him sitting out a quarter or a series. “Yeah, it is disappointing, but I still believe in the young man,” McDermott said of Buffalo’s top pick in the 2024 draft. “I believe he will learn from it.” Buffalo (7-3) resembled the team that beat Kanas City 28-21 and Carolina 40-9 coming out of its bye week, rather than the one that lost back-to-back games to Atlanta and New England entering its break last month. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers (6-4) let their NFC South lead dwindle to a half-game after Carolina beat Atlanta. “We’re in a good place mentally,” Tampa Bay coach Todd Bowles said. “Our fight is outstanding. Our execution needs to be cleaned up.” A week after Mayfield said the Bucs needed more of a killer instinct following a 28-23 loss to New England, Tampa Bay’s offense showed a spark, trading scores with Buffalo through the early part of the fourth quarter. Mayfield finished 16 of 28 for 173 yards with a 28-yard TD pass to Sean Tucker and a 4-yard TD run. Mayfield also threw an interception and lost a fumble when sacked on Tampa Bay’s final drive. Tucker finished with 106 yards rushing and scored on runs of 43 and 28 yards. “The fight was there, the toughness. It just came down to not making enough plays,” Mayfield said. “There was definitely a lot more points out there for us today.” One opportunity came after Allen’s first interception — a wobbly shovel pass over the middle while he was under pressure at his own goal line — gave Tampa Bay the ball at Buffalo’s 7. Tucker managed just 2 yards on two runs and Mayfield overthrew Emeka Egbuka in the end zone, forcing Tampa Bay to settle for Chase McLaughlin’s 23-yard field goal.

according to Mayor Eric Adams’ office. The shooting happened just after 2 a.m. outside a business on West 38th Street near 7th Avenue, according to the New York Police Department. A 29-year-old man was shot in the abdomen, police said. The man was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was in critical, but stable condition. There have been no arrests and the investigation is ongoing. Adams’ office said that the man shot was Boyd. Adams said in a message posted on social media that he is praying for Boyd and his loved ones. “Although we’ve gotten shootings to historic lows in our city, we must continue to work to end gun violence,” Adams said. “Too many young lives have been tragically altered and cut short by this epidemic.” “We are aware of the situation involving Kris Boyd and will have no further comment at this time,” a Jets spokesperson said in a statement. Boyd’s agent didn’t immediately respond to a text message inquiring about the incident. Boyd hasn’t played this season, his first with the Jets, after going on the season-ending injured reserve list on Aug. 18 with a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.

He made headlines during the Texans’ divisional playoff loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in January when he celebrated a forced fumble on a kickoff by ripping off his helmet and nearly shoving his special teams coach to the ground. Boyd played his first four seasons with Minnesota after being a seventh-round pick by the Vikings out of Texas in 2019. He signed with the Arizona Cardinals in 2023 and then joined Houston’s practice squad later that season. Teammates asked for prayers for Boyd in social media posts on Sunday afternoon. “Everybody please send prayers to my brother and teammate Kris Boyd and his family!!! Lord please hold your healing hand over Kris and guide him back to health and safety,” linebacker Jermaine Johnson said in a post. “Lord, place your mighty hand on him as he fights lord God. Guide every doctor, nurse, and surgeon who touches him lord,” defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said in a post. “Give his family strength!

PROVO, Utah (AP) — Bear Bachmeier threw for 296 yards and a touchdown to lead No. 12 BYU to a 44-13 victory over TCU on Saturday night. Bachmeier added 59 yards and another touchdown on the ground for his seventh game this season with both a passing TD and a rushing TD. He’s the first BYU player since Virgil Carter in 1966 to accomplish the feat in a single season. The freshman racked up 239 passing yards in the first half alone. “Offensively, it felt like it was just good to let Bear throw the ball,” BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. Parker Kingston added 80 yards on five catches. LJ Martin led BYU (9-1, 6-1 Big 12, No. 12 CFP) with 88 yards and a touchdown on the ground. The Cougars scored on their first seven drives and did not punt until the fourth quarter. “Everyone contributed today — the pass game, the run game,” tight end Carsen Ryan said. “We were firing on all cylinders, so it was a good bounce back for us.” Josh Hoover threw for a season-low 183 yards and had two interceptions for the Horned Frogs. Eric McAlister had 107 yards on four catches. TCU (6-4, 3-4) had just 15 first downs and went 1 of 10 on third down. Tennessee’s Boo Carter no longer on team, enters transfer portal Conference race update: James Madison will play for the Sun Belt championship Maryland’s Mike Locksley will return in 2026 with more money to spend on talent acquisition, AD says “They had a great plan, they tried to take away the things we did best, they put us in a hole,” Hoover said. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25 ? Now it’s your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. BYU attacked on the ground and through the air with equal efficiency to take control before halftime. Kingston finished off a 10-play, 91-yard drive in the first quarter by scoring on an 11-yard jet sweep. Then, in the second quarter, Bachmeier barreled up the middle for a 17-yard touchdown and threw a short pass that Carsen Ryan took 43 yards for another score. It gave BYU a 24-3 lead with 6:00 left before halftime. “Our guys were excited to play, I can promise you,” TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. “We just didn’t get off to a great start, BYU took the ball down and scored quickly on us and made us get on our heels pretty quickly.” Both of BYU’s fourth-quarter touchdowns came off TCU turnovers. Faletau Satuala intercepted a pass at the TCU 43 to set up a 1-yard, fourth-down plunge from Martin. Then, Tanner Wall returned Hoover’s second interception for 68 yards to put the Cougars up 44-13 with 4:09 left. The Takeaway TCU: An inability to get stops on defense and convert third downs on offense kept the Horned Frogs on their heels for much of the game. BYU: The Cougars were methodical and efficient on offense from the start, helping them snap a five-game losing streak in the series with TCU. By halftime, Bachmeier had his fourth 200-yard game as a passer, and the Cougars had eclipsed 100 rushing yards. Efficient Football BYU committed a season-low two penalties for 25 yards. The previous best for the Cougars was four penalties for 35 yards against Stanford. They also finished with only one turnover a week after having three against Texas Tech. It helped BYU sustain longer drives. The Cougars went 6 of 12 on third down, converted all five trips to the red zone, and held the ball for 36 minutes. “We can do some really good things when everybody plays clean football,” Sitake said. Career First Wall’s late pick-six was the first interception return for a touchdown of his collegiate career and his third interception of the season. A TCU defender chased him down inside the Horned Frog 5 and shoved him in the back, propelling Wall across the goal line. “I got a little boost at the end,” Wall joked.

know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/texas-georgia-score-c0d7a9f525e4e2baef0c22ab1e7fa5f6","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"00:05:30Z","title":"Georgia Beats Texas 35-10 in Dominant Win to Boost Playoff Hopes","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Georgia defeated Texas 35-10 in a dominant performance, with Gunner Stockton throwing four touchdowns and rushing for one, including the game-winning 6-yard scoring pass after an onside kick.

(AP) — Georgia owned the fourth quarter and beat Texas — again. Gunner Stockton threw four touchdown passes — two to Noah Thomas — and ran for a score to outplay Arch Manning as No. 5 Georgia strengthened its postseason standing by overwhelming No. 10 Texas 35-10 on Saturday night for its sixth straight victory. The Bulldogs outscored the Longhorns 21-0 in the fourth quarter. “It’s the approach we take,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “We’re going to dominate and try to win the fourth quarter.” After Texas trimmed Georgia’s lead to 14-10 in the third quarter, Stockton’s 30-yard touchdown pass to London Humphreys, followed by a successful onside kick, allowed the Bulldogs to put the game away. “I would not say that they lost composure,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said about his players’ effort late in the game. “I think we lost some focus, we lost some intensity in the fourth quarter.” Smart said Georgia’s offense “is like a big, strong anaconda. They keep squeezing you.” Stockton’s 6-yard scoring pass to Lawson Luckie following the recovery of the kick iced the win. Stockton added a 4-yard scoring run late in the game. Tennessee’s Boo Carter no longer on team, enters transfer portal Conference race update: James Madison will play for the Sun Belt championship Maryland’s Mike Locksley will return in 2026 with more money to spend on talent acquisition, AD says With No. 4 Alabama’s 23-21 loss to No. 11 Oklahoma earlier Saturday, Georgia (9-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) could move into position for a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. The Bulldogs also boosted their hopes of defending their SEC championship. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25 ? Now it’s your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. The Bulldogs claimed a 22-19 overtime win over the Longhorns in last year’s SEC championship game in Atlanta following a win at Texas earlier in the season. Georgia’s win in the Longhorns’ first visit to Athens gave the Bulldogs three wins in two years in the series. “We’ve got to score every time we get the ball against good teams like that,” Manning said about Georgia. Texas (7-3, 4-2) saw its four-game winning streak end, putting its playoff hopes in jeopardy. “We messed up a lot of stuff, and you got to look in the mirror first and realize what you could’ve done better,” Texas safety Michael Taaffe said. “Everybody — coaches, players, staff, every person that’s involved in our hunt to win each and every week — has got to be better. You can’t do the pointing finger game until you look at yourself, so I got to be better.” Georgia has rolled since its 22-19 overtime home loss to Alabama on Sept. 27. That loss ended Georgia’s 33-game home winning streak, which was the longest active streak in FBS. Texas linebacker Anthony Hill’s interception midway through the third quarter gave the Longhorns the ball at the Georgia 36. The Bulldogs’ first penalty, a pass interference call against Zion Branch on a third-down play, set up Manning’s 7-yard scoring pass to Ryan Wingo. Georgia answered with a 10-play touchdown drive capped by Stockton’s 30-yard scoring pass to London Humphreys. The Bulldogs covered a fourth-and-1 play on Stockton’s 10-yard pass to Chauncey Bowens and survived another fourth down when Longhorns outside linebacker Colin Simmons was called for an offsides penalty. Smart kept gambling by calling the onside kick recovered by Cash Jones, a native of Brock, Texas. “Every one of y’all would have thought I was an idiot if it didn’t work, and that’s OK, too,” Smart said. The surprise onside kick decision was a hit with Stockton. “It was awesome,” Stockton said. “I didn’t realize we were doing that. It was a big momentum play and I’m glad it worked out for us.” QB comparison Stockton completed 24 of 29 passes for 229 yards. His interception was only his third of the season. He now has produced 27 touchdowns this season — 19 passing and eight rushing. “He’s playing at a high level and a high clip right now,” Smart said. Manning, who said this week he considered signing with Georgia until the end of his recruitment, completed 27 of 43 passes for 251 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Rally Dogs The Longhorns’ only lead was 3-0. Georgia has trailed in seven of eight SEC games this season and is 6-1 in those games. Home cooking Georgia improved to 9-0 at Sanford Stadium against top 10 teams in Smart’s 10 seasons. Overall, Georgia is 55-5 at home under Smart. The takeaway Texas: Dropped passes and penalties hurt the Longhorns. Texas drew seven penalties for 43 yards in the first half and nine for 58 yards in the game. Wingo stumbled after his catch on the Longhorns’ first snap, and that 1-yard gain set the pace for the half. Wingo had a third-down drop at the end of the 13-play drive to set up a 33-yard field goal by Mason Shipley. The Longhorns ran for only 19 yards and were successful on only 2 of 12 third downs. Georgia: After giving up the field goal on the opening drive by Texas, the Bulldogs’ defense gave up no more points in the first half. KJ Bolden had a second-quarter interception, Gabe Harris, Quintavius Johnson and Zayden Walker sacked Manning and CJ Allen had a big third-down stop of Jack Endries for a loss of 2 yards for the defensive highlights. Allen left the game with a leg injury in the first half. Up next Texas: Hosts Arkansas on Saturday. Georgia: Hosts Charlotte on Saturday. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here and here (AP News mobile app).

at the North American box office this weekend. Lionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” pulled in $21.3 million, while Paramount’s “The Running Man” made $17 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” which cost a reported $90 million to produce, comes almost 10 years after the second film. Including ticket sales from 64 international territories, its worldwide opening is estimated to be around $75.5 million. Going into the weekend, it was expected to be a closer race between the two newcomers. “Honestly, I didn’t see us being number one for the weekend about 10 days ago,” Kevin Grayson, the president of worldwide distribution for Lionsgate’s motion picture group, said Sunday. “But as we started to get closer and ticket sale numbers started to pop, we saw that there was going to be a horse race. Then we pulled away Saturday morning.” Grayson said it’s a testament not only to the franchise but the marketing and publicity strategies which, “really helped us get into a position where we now can play all the way through the holiday corridor.” Related Stories Movie Review: Time has outrun this ‘Running Man’ 5 MIN READ ★ ★ ★ ★ Fall Movie Guide: Here are the films coming out from September to Christmas 15 MIN READ The first two movies in the “Now You See Me” series, released in 2013 and 2016, earned over $686 million worldwide. This installment, directed by Ruben Fleischer, sees the return of the original “Four Horsemen,” Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco, and introduces three younger magicians into the mix: Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt and Justice Smith. A fourth film is already in the works. Reviews were mixed on Rotten Tomatoes, coming in at 59%. According to PostTrak polling, audiences were a bit more positive, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend. Audience scores were slightly less for “The Running Man,” which had a 58% “definitely recommend.” Both earned a B+ CinemaScore, but more people chose the franchise. One key difference is that women made up more of the “Now You See Me” audience (54%). They only accounted for 37% of “The Running Man” ticket buyers. Edgar Wright directed and co-wrote “The Running Man,” the second adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, first published in 1982. The first film starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and was released in 1987 to mixed reviews and a tepid box office, earning only $38 million against a $27 million budget. The new version stars Glen Powell , who has had a good track record starring in box office hits, from the romantic comedy “Anyone But You” to “Twisters.” Paramount Pictures released “The Running Man” in 3,400 domestic locations and 58 international markets. Worldwide, it earned $28.2 million against a reported $110 million budget. The weekend’s other new opener, “Keeper,” the third feature from “Longlegs” filmmaker Oz Perkins , cratered with $2.5 million and a D+ CinemaScore. But as an acquisition title for Neon, it’s also not a disaster. Third place went to “Predator: Badlands” with $13 million in its second weekend, followed by “Regretting You” in fourth with $4 million. “Black Phone 2” rounded out the top five with $2.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.7 million after five weeks in theaters. In anticipation of the big budget musical “Wicked: For Good,” which opens next week , Universal Pictures put “Wicked” back in 2,195 theaters, where it made $1.2 million — barely missing a spot in the top 10. The box office should pick up considerably when “Wicked 2” blows into theaters, followed by “Zootopia 2” before the Thanksgiving holiday. Comscore’s Paul Dergarabedian said it could be one of the highest grossing five-day Thanksgiving frames of all time. “After a terrible October, the lowest grossing in decades , it’s just warming up,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s never too late to get the momentum moving in the right direction.” Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” $21.3 million. 2. “The Running Man,” $17 million. 3. “Predator: Badlands,” $13 million. 4. “Regretting You,” $4 million. 5. “Black Phone 2,” $2.7 million. 6. “Nuremberg,” $2.6 million. 7. “Keeper,” $2.5 million. 8. “Sarah’s Oil,” $2.3 million. 9. “Bugonia” and “Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc”,” (tie) $1.6 million."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/indigenous-activists-storm-cop30-climate-summit-in-brazil-demanding-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"04:16:29+00:00","title":"Indigenous activists storm COP30 climate summit in Brazil, demanding action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including members of the Tupinamba community and organized through the Yaku Mama flotilla, stormed the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding that climate policies include Indigenous voices and protect their lands from agribusiness, mining, and logging.

climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem, highlighting tensions with the Brazilian government’s claim that the meeting is open to Indigenous voices.\n\nDozens of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) on Tuesday evening after hundreds of people participated in a march to the venue.\n\n“We can’t eat money,” said Gilmar, an Indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community near the lower reaches of the Tapajos River in Brazil, who uses only one name, referring to the emphasis on climate finance at many of the meetings during the ongoing summit.\n\n“We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UN, which is responsible for security inside the venue, said in a statement that “a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue”.\n\nThe protest came as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year’s COP30 negotiations, even as several industries continue to further  encroach on the Amazon  rainforest during his presidency.\n\nLula told a leaders summit last week that participants at the COP30 would be “inspired by Indigenous peoples and traditional communities – for whom sustainability has always been synonymous with their way of life”.\n\nHowever, Indigenous participants taking part in rolling protests in and around the climate change meeting say that more needs to be done, both by Lula’s left-leaning government at home and around the world.\n\nA joint statement ahead of the summit from Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon Basin and all Biomes of Brazil emphasised the importance of protecting Indigenous territories in the Amazon.\n\nAs “a carbon sink of approximately 340 million tons” of carbon dioxide, the world’s largest rainforest, “represents one of the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies”, the statement said.\n\nThe statement also called for Indigenous territories to be excluded from mining and other activities, including “in particular, the Amazon,  Congo , and  Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia  basins”.\n\nLeo Cerda, one of the organisers of the Yaku Mama protest flotilla, which arrived at the summit after sailing 3,000km (1,864 miles) down the Amazon river, told Al Jazeera that Indigenous peoples are trying to secure nature not just for themselves but for humanity.\n\n“Most states want our resources, but they don’t want to guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Cerda said.\n\nAs the flotilla sailed towards COP30, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, received a licence to begin exploratory  offshore oil drilling  near the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n“You cannot make climate policies without indigenous people at the negotiation table.”\n\nThis Indigenous activist flotilla just sailed the entire length of the Amazon River to take their message to the  #COP30  climate conference.  pic.twitter.com/55YjlZgJct\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  November 11, 2025\n\nCerda also said it was important for Indigenous people to be present at the conference, considering the fossil fuel industry has also participated in the meetings for several decades.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, some 5,350 fossil fuel lobbyists participated in UN climate summits over the past four years.\n\nRepresentatives from 195 countries are participating in this year’s summit, with the  notable absence of the United States . Under President Donald Trump, the US has fought against action on climate change, further cementing its role as the world’s largest historical emitter of fossil fuels.\n\nMost recently, Trump  has torpedoed  negotiations to address emissions from the shipping industry.\n\nNotably, this year’s meeting is the first to take place since the UN’s top court,  the International Court of Justice (ICJ) , ruled that countries must meet their climate obligations and that failing to do so could violate international law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/ecuador-votes-on-return-of-us-military-bases-to-tackle-drug-violence","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:02:45Z","title":"Ecuador votes on return of US military bases to tackle drug violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ecuador is holding a national referendum on whether to lift a constitutional ban on foreign military bases, specifically to allow the return of U.S. forces to the Manta airbase to combat escalating drug-related violence.

bases to tackle drug violence\n\nEcuadoreans are voting on whether to lift a constitutional ban on foreign military bases as right-wing  President Daniel Noboa  pushes for help from the United States in confronting spiralling drug-fuelled violence.\n\nNearly 14 million people cast ballots on Sunday in a referendum that also asks whether to reduce the number of lawmakers.\n\nThe vote comes as Ecuador grapples with unprecedented bloodshed, with the country’s homicide rate projected to hit 50 per 100,000 people this year, the highest in Latin America.\n\nPolls suggest more than 61 percent of voters back allowing foreign bases, which would likely see the US return to the Manta airbase on the Pacific coast.\n\nUS forces operated from Manta between 1999 and 2009 as part of anti-narcotics efforts, until leftist President Rafael Correa held a referendum on foreign troops, resulting in their constitutional ban.\n\nEcuador, once considered one of the more stable countries in the region, has in recent years faced a sharp rise in violence, with drug cartels, including powerful ones from Mexico, exploiting porous borders and weak institutions to expand their influence.\n\nNoboa, a 37-year-old heir to a prominent banana-exporting fortune, who took office in November 2023, has responded with militarised crackdowns, deployed soldiers to the streets and prisons, launched raids on gang strongholds, declared states of emergency and tightened security at key infrastructure hubs.\n\nThe first half of this year saw 4,619 murders, the highest on record, according to Ecuador’s Organized Crime Observatory.\n\nAs voting opened, Noboa announced the capture in Spain of Wilmer Geovanny Chavarria Barre, known as Pipo, leader of the notorious Los Lobos gang, who had faked his death and fled to Europe.\n\nHe was arrested in the Spanish city of Malaga after Ecuadorean authorities worked with their Spanish counterparts to track him down.\n\nInterior Minister John Reimberg linked Chavarria to more than 400 killings and said he had run criminal networks from behind bars for eight years until 2019.\n\nNoboa said the Los Lobos chief had overseen illicit mining schemes and maintained trafficking connections with Mexico’s Jalisco New Generation Cartel, all whilst hiding in Europe under a false identity.\n\nThe US  designated  Los Lobos and Los Choneros, another Ecuadorian crime syndicate, as “terrorist” organisations in September.\n\nCritics question whether military force alone can address the crisis.\n\nFormer President Correa has described the return of foreign forces as “an insult to our public forces and an assault to our sovereignty”, adding: “We do not need foreign soldiers. We need government.”\n\nThe referendum also includes questions on a constituent assembly that opposition groups fear could allow Noboa to consolidate power.\n\nIn August, Noboa led a demonstration against Constitutional Court justices, with officials calling them “enemies of the people” after they limited expansive security laws.\n\nCritics of the president also argue that a constitutional rewrite will not solve problems like insecurity and poor access to health and education services.\n\nEcuador became a major cocaine transit hub after the 2016 peace deal in Colombia demobilised guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), with international trafficking organisations quickly filling the void.\n\nThe country’s Pacific ports, proximity to coca-producing Peru and Colombia, and weak institutions have made it central to the global cocaine supply chain.\n\nNoboa, who survived an attack in October when his car was surrounded by protesters and struck by bullets, has compared his security approach to that of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, posting images of shaven-headed inmates in orange uniforms at a new mega-prison."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with cases spreading across all provinces and territories and resulting in 5,000 confirmed cases and two deaths.

“elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"22:09:11+00:00","title":"US boat strike kills 3, as aircraft carrier arrives near Venezuela","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States conducted a military strike on a vessel allegedly involved in drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific, killing three people, as part of a broader military buildup in Latin America.

strike kills 3, as aircraft carrier arrives near Venezuela\n\nThe United States has carried out its latest military strike against an alleged drug boat off Latin America, as US President Donald Trump raises pressure on Venezuela with a major military buildup in the region.\n\nThe US military struck a vessel believed to be transporting drugs in the eastern Pacific on Saturday, killing three people on board, the Pentagon said on Sunday.\n\n“Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” US Southern Command said in a social media post.\n\nThe announcement of the strike came hours after Washington’s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, arrived in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe deployment of the carrier has raised fears that the Trump administration could be readying itself for imminent military action against Venezuela.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has cast the military actions in the region as an effort to counter illicit drug flows, Caracas sees the moves as a pretext to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power.\n\nTrump, who said last week he had “sort of” made up his mind on the possibility of military action against Venezuela, on Sunday suggested that his administration could hold talks with Maduro.\n\n“We’ll see how that turns out. But they would like to talk,” Trump told reporters.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Washington would designate Cartel de los Soles, a criminal organisation that the Trump administration claims is headed by Maduro, a “foreign terrorist organization” (FTO).\n\n“Headed by the illegitimate Nicolas Maduro, the group has corrupted the institutions of government in Venezuela and is responsible for terrorist violence conducted by and with other designated FTOs as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe,” Rubio said in a post in X.\n\nRubio did not provide evidence for his claims.\n\nThe US has  conducted at least 21 military strikes  on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific since September, killing some 80 people.\n\nInternational law and human rights experts say the attacks  amount to extrajudicial executions , even if those targeted are suspected of drug trafficking.\n\nThe Trump administration has so far provided no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were “narcoterrorists.”\n\nOn Saturday, the Reuters news agency reported that senior Trump administration officials held three meetings at the White House this week to discuss options for possible military action against Venezuela.\n\nThe reported meetings come as the Trump administration has continued to significantly expand the US military’s presence in Latin America, deploying F-35 aircraft, warships and a nuclear submarine.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pentagon said the Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group, which includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with at least 4,000 sailors and dozens of “tactical aircraft” on board.\n\nThere are now about 12,000 US sailors and Marines in the region, in what US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Thursday formally named  “Operation Southern Spear” .\n\nUnder the US Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\n\nBut Trump  has said  that he would not “necessarily ask for a declaration of war” in order to continue killing people “that are bringing drugs into our country.\n\nRear Admiral Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to “protect our nation’s security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere”.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, which is located just 11 kilometres (seven miles) off the Venezuelan coast, officials said troops had begun training exercises with the US military.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Sean Sobers, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump’s strikes, said the exercises were the second such drills in less than a month and would help address violent crime linked to the country’s status as a stopover point for drug shipments.\n\nVenezuela, which has cast the drills as an act of aggression, has yet to comment on the arrival of the US aircraft carrier.\n\nMaduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the US, has accused the US government of “fabricating a new eternal war” against him and his country.\n\nOn Sunday, Maduro wrote on his Facebook page that the Venezuelan people are “ready to defend their homeland against any criminal aggression”.\n\nLast week, Venezuela’s government announced a “massive” mobilisation of troops and civilians to defend against possible attack by the US."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02Z","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A significant surge in bear attacks across Japan, particularly in northern prefectures like Akita and Hokkaido, has prompted emergency responses and international concern.

a surge in bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a dire water crisis exacerbated by six consecutive years of drought, extreme heat, and severe precipitation shortfalls.

struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/skateboarding-helps-gaza-children-with-trauma-amid-ruins-adds-rare-joy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:14:41Z","title":"Skateboarding helps Gaza children with trauma amid ruins, adds rare joy","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the midst of ongoing violence and widespread trauma, a mobile skateboarding initiative in Gaza provides children with a rare outlet for mental health support, recreation, and emotional resilience.

2025-11-16T16:14:41+00:00\n\nTitle: Skateboarding helps Gaza children with trauma amid ruins, adds rare joy\n\nA mobile skatepark moving between displacement camps in  Gaza  is providing rare mental health support to children trapped in one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises, where trauma and grief are rife.\n\nAmid the wreckage of Gaza City, where collapsed buildings and twisted concrete dominate the landscape, a group of young Palestinians has transformed the destruction into an unlikely playground.\n\nSince the fragile ceasefire began on October 10, skateboard coaches have been running sessions that offer traumatised children brief moments of freedom and normalcy.\n\n“We used to have skateparks in the Gaza Strip; this was our dream here in Gaza,” said Rajab al-Reifi, one of the coaches working with the children. “But unfortunately, after we finally achieved that dream and built skateparks, the war came and destroyed everything.”\n\nThe skateboarding initiative operates against a backdrop of  continuing Israeli violence  despite the ceasefire.\n\nIsraeli forces have killed at least 260 Palestinians and wounded 632 others since the truce began on October 10, with attacks occurring on 25 of the past 31 days.\n\nThe sessions face severe challenges.\n\nWith equipment shortages across Gaza, every skateboard wheel and piece of wood has become precious. Al-Reifi often repairs damaged boards between sessions, knowing replacements are nearly impossible to obtain.\n\nOne of the few flat courtyards to survive Israel’s bombardment provides a training ground for beginners, while more adventurous skaters have turned piles of rubble and collapsed walls into makeshift ramps and obstacles.\n\nRimas Dalloul, another dedicated coach, works to keep the children engaged despite the dire conditions.\n\n“We don’t have enough skateboards for everyone, and there is no protective gear,” she explained. “Their clothes are all they have to help cushion them when they fall. They get injured sometimes, but they always come back. The desire to play is stronger than the pain.”\n\nAmong the young skaters is seven-year-old Marah Salem, who has been practicing for seven months.\n\n“I come here to have fun. I don’t want to skip any sessions; I want to be consistent,” she said. “Even during the war, I used to skateboard. I used to run away from the bombardment to skate on the streets.”\n\nHer determination reflects a broader resilience among Gaza’s children, who have endured nearly two years of Israeli military assault.\n\nThe skateboarding sessions offer children a form of recreation and a temporary escape, but also a means to process trauma and a communal activity.\n\nThe mental health needs of Gaza’s children remain staggering.\n\nHumanitarian organisations had already identified more than one million Palestinian children in need of mental health services before the latest conflict intensified.\n\nThe scale of the conflict means no child has been shielded from its psychological impact, with mass displacement, family separations, and widespread casualties affecting the entire young population.\n\nAt least 17,000 children are now  unaccompanied or separated  from their parents, while child protection cases surged by 48 percent in September alone, the International Rescue Committee reports.\n\nFor the young skaters, the sessions offer something that war has tried to take away, the simple freedom of childhood play.\n\nTheir schools have been decimated, their homes destroyed, and more than 658,000 school-age children have lost access to education for nearly two years.\n\nYet in the ruins of their neighbourhoods, these children are finding ways to move forward.\n\nThey are simply kids on skateboards, laughing, falling, getting back up, and pushing forward – both literally and metaphorically – through the rubble of their shattered world."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/thousands-march-for-climate-action-outside-cop30-summit-in-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00+00:00","title":"Thousands march for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of people, including Indigenous activists and youth leaders, marched in Belem, Brazil, during the COP30 climate summit to demand greater inclusion and protection of Indigenous voices and the Amazon rainforest.

for the  voices of Indigenous peoples  and environmental defenders to be heard at the United Nations COP30 climate summit.\n\nIndigenous community members mixed with activists at Saturday’s march, which unfolded in a festive atmosphere as participants carried a giant beach ball representing the Earth and a Brazilian flag emblazoned with the words “Protected Amazon”.\n\nIt was the first major protest outside the conference, which began earlier this week in Belem, bringing together world leaders, activists and experts in a push to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIndigenous activists previously  stormed the summit , disrupting the proceedings as they demanded that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva take concrete action to ensure their territories are protected from growing threats.\n\nAmnesty International warned in a recent report that  billions of people  around the world are threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel projects, such as oil-and-gas pipelines and coal mines.\n\nIndigenous communities , in particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make our voices heard from  the Amazon  and demand results,” he said. “We need more Indigenous representatives at COP to defend our rights.”\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help  poorer countries adapt to climate change."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/israel-pushes-us-to-close-door-on-palestinian-statehood-before-un-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:21:54+00:00","title":"Israel

Palestinian statehood before UNSC vote\n\nIsrael is engaged in a last-ditch bid to change the wording of a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution on the next phase of United States President Donald Trump’s  Gaza peace plan  that was recently amended to mention a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday that his opposition to a Palestinian state had “not changed one bit”, one day before the UNSC votes on the US-drafted resolution, which would mandate a transitional administration and an  international stabilisation force  (ISF) in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli public broadcaster Kan reported on Sunday that Netanyahu’s government was engaged in a last-minute diplomatic push to alter the draft resolution, which the US had changed to include more defined language about Palestinian self-determination under pressure from Arab and Muslim countries expected to contribute troops to the ISF.\n\nThe draft now says that “conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” after reforms to the Palestinian Authority are “faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced”.\n\nThere has been criticism that Palestinian voices and aspirations have been sidelined in the whole spectacle of Trump’s Gaza plan from its launch, which came with the US president’s customary fanfare.\n\nLater on Sunday, Hamas and other Palestinian resistance factions called on Algeria – a non-permanent member of the UNSC – to reject the plan for stabilisation forces to be deployed in Gaza.\n\nIn a statement, the resistance factions called the efforts “a new attempt to impose another form of occupation on our land and people, and to legitimise foreign trusteeship”.\n\n“We direct a sincere and fraternal appeal to the Algerian Republic, government and people, to continue adhering to its principled positions supporting Palestine, and its steadfast rejection of any projects targeting Gaza’s identity and our people’s right to self-determination,” the statement added.\n\nOn Friday, a joint statement with eight countries – Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkiye – urged “swift adoption” of the draft resolution by the 15-member UNSC. Potential contributors to the force have indicated that a UN mandate is essential for their participation.\n\nIsrael has already said it will not accept Turkiye, a key Gaza ceasefire mediator,  having any role  on the ground.\n\nTurkiye has maintained staunch criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza over the past two years and recently issued  arrest warrants for genocide  against Netanyahu and other senior officials.\n\nAhead of Monday’s crucial vote, which is expected to garner the nine votes needed to pass, with the likely abstention of Russia and China, Netanyahu confidants and officials from the Foreign Ministry were said to be engaged in intensive talks with their US counterparts, according to the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (Kan).\n\nA far-right walkout over the ceasefire plan, in which Trump has heavily invested his own prestige, could bring down Netanyahu’s right-wing government well before the next election, which must be held by October 2026.\n\nOn Sunday, Israeli government officials lined up to express their opposition to any proposals backing a Palestinian state.\n\n“Israel’s policy is clear: no Palestinian state will be established,” Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X.\n\nHe was followed by Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, who said on X that his country would “not agree to the establishment of a Palestinian terror state in the heart of the Land of Israel”.\n\nFar-right firebrand and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called the Palestinian identity an “invention”.\n\nHardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a major backer of Israel’s settler movement who has been  sanctioned  by a number of countries for “incitement of violence” against Palestinians, urged Netanyahu to take action.\n\n“Formulate immediately an appropriate and decisive response that will make it clear to the entire world – no Palestinian state will ever arise on the lands of our homeland,” he said on X.\n\nThe UNSC resolution would give the UN’s blessing to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point plan, which brought about a ceasefire after two years of genocidal war that has killed nearly 70,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe ceasefire came into effect on October 10, although it has been repeatedly  breached  by Israel with near-daily attacks that have killed hundreds of people.\n\nThere has been plenty of jockeying ahead of the vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia is circulating its own  resolution  to rival the US version, offering stronger language on Palestinian statehood and stressing that the occupied West Bank and Gaza must be joined as a contiguous state under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn a statement, Russia’s UN mission said that its objective was to “to amend the US concept and bring it into conformity” with previous UNSC decisions.\n\n“We would like to stress that our document does not contradict the American initiative,” said the statement. “On the contrary, it notes the tireless efforts by the mediators – the United States, Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye – without which the long-awaited ceasefire and the release of hostages and detainees would have been impossible.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/syria-detains-members-of-security-forces-over-suwayda-violence","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:53:03+00:00","title":"Syria detains members of security forces over Suwayda violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to sectarian violence in Syria’s Suwayda province in July, where hundreds of Druze civilians were killed and videos revealed brutal acts of violence including murder and humiliation, the Syrian government has detained members of its security and military forces accused of misconduct.

arrested members of the country’s security and military services as part of a probe into sectarian violence in the southern province of  Suwayda  earlier this year that left hundreds dead.\n\nJudge Hatem Naasan, head of a committee investigating the eruption of violence in Suwayda in July, said that members of security services and the military “who were proven to have committed violations” based on findings and videos posted online had been detained.\n\n“Videos posted on social media clearly showed faces, and they were detained by the authorities concerned,” Naasan said, adding that security personnel were detained by the Interior Ministry while members of the military are being held by the Defence Ministry.\n\nVideos that surfaced online had shown armed men killing Druze civilians kneeling in public squares and shaving the moustaches off elderly men in an act of humiliation.\n\nNaasan did not specify how many arrests were made. Nor did he announce a death toll, saying this would come in the final report that is expected by the end of the year.\n\nHe acknowledged that “some foreign fighters randomly and individually entered the city of Suwayda”, saying that some had been detained and questioned. He stated that none of them were members of the Syrian armed or security forces.\n\nFighting broke out  in the  Druze-majority province  after a Druze truck driver was abducted on a public highway, drawing in Bedouin tribal fighters from other parts of the country.\n\nGovernment forces were deployed to restore order, but were accused of siding with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters.\n\nA  ceasefire  was established after a week of violence.\n\nClaiming that it was protecting the Druze, Israel also intervened, launching dozens of air attacks on government forces in Suwayda and even striking the Syrian Ministry of Defence headquarters in the centre of the capital Damascus.\n\nIsrael has carried out hundreds of air strikes around the country since the end of the 54-year al-Assad dynasty in December, mainly targeting, it says, assets of the Syrian army, but also carrying out incursions.\n\nAfter the acts of violence in July, many in Suwayda now want some form of autonomy in a federal system. A smaller group is calling for total partition.\n\nPresident Ahmed al-Sharaa has been painstakingly trying to usher Syria back into the international fold, with notable successes. In September, he was the first Syrian leader to address the United Nations General Assembly in six decades, and he  was invited to the White House  on Monday for a second meeting with United States President Donald Trump.\n\nAl-Sharaa, who wants to unify his war-ravaged nation and end its decades of international isolation, was the first-ever Syrian leader to visit the White House since the country’s independence in 1946.\n\nBoth the US and European Union have dropped sanctions against Syria, and major Gulf Arab investment is giving the war-devastated nation a critical economic lifeline.\n\nBut al-Sharaa’s quest for national unity after a 14-year ruinous civil war still faces major internal and external challenges ahead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/toppled-hasinas-son-warns-bangladesh-court-will-sentence-her-to-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"21:42:06+00:00","title":"Toppled Hasina’s son warns Bangladesh court will sentence her to death","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The son of former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Sajeeb Wazed, has warned that a special tribunal will convict and likely sentence her to death, while asserting that she remains safe in exile in India.

tribunal will likely sentence her to death, but that she remains safe in her Indian exile, as he threatened her supporters will block next year’s election unless a ban on her party is lifted.\n\nSajeeb Wazed made the comments to the Reuters news agency on Sunday, a day before the Dhaka court was due to deliver a televised verdict against Hasina on charges of crimes against humanity for carrying out a  deadly crackdown on protesters  in 2024.\n\nThe threats are likely to further stoke tensions in Bangladesh, where a wave of bombings and arson attacks has gripped the capital ahead of the ruling and February’s planned election.\n\n“We know exactly what the verdict is going to be. They’re televising it. They’re going to convict her, and they’ll probably sentence her to death,” said Wazed, in the United States capital, Washington, DC.\n\n“What can they do to my mother? My mother is safe in India. India is giving her full security.”\n\nHasina, 78, has lived in exile in New Delhi since fleeing Bangladesh in August 2024, when the student-led protests forced an end to her  15 years in power .\n\nA United Nations report  estimated  that up to 1,400 people were killed during the demonstrations that year, most by security forces firing live ammunition.\n\nThe former leader faces trial at Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal over the deadly crackdown. She denies wrongdoing and calls the proceedings politically motivated.\n\nWazed told Reuters that supporters of the Awami League – the nominally centre-left, secular party that has dominated Bangladeshi politics since independence – would prevent elections from going ahead if the party remains banned.\n\n“We will not allow elections without the Awami League to go ahead,” he said. “Our protests are going to get stronger and stronger, and we will do whatever it takes.”\n\nHe added that “unless the international community does something, eventually there’s probably going to be violence in Bangladesh before these elections”.\n\nThe interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus,  suspended  the party’s registration in May and banned its political activities, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into senior leaders.\n\nA government spokesperson rejected Wazed’s warnings.\n\n“The interim government regards any incitement to violence – especially by exiled political figures – as deeply irresponsible and reprehensible,” the spokesperson was quoted by Reuters as saying.\n\nIn an earlier interview with The Associated Press news agency, Wazed said the “ban has to be lifted, the elections have to be inclusive and free and fair. What is happening now really is an attempt to keep my mother and our political leaders from running in elections”.\n\nViolence has intensified in Dhaka in recent days.\n\nOn Sunday, crude bombs exploded across the city, following 32 blasts reported on November 12 alone. Dozens of buses have been torched, and authorities have detained Awami League activists over alleged sabotage.\n\nSchools in the capital Dhaka and other major cities went online last week.\n\nBangladesh has deployed more than 400 border guards to reinforce security, strengthened checkpoints and restricted public gatherings.\n\nHasina remains “a lightning rod in Bangladeshi politics”, Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“She can deliver an online speech in India and trigger a violent reaction, as happened earlier this year,” he said.\n\n“With Sheikh Hasina’s son threatening to block the election, it makes almost overt the party’s intention to use violence in the context of the upcoming election,” Kugelman added.\n\nThe violence occurs against a backdrop of broader concerns about the Yunus government’s record.\n\nA report by Bangladeshi rights group Odhikar  documented  at least 40 extrajudicial killings between August 2024 and September 2025, despite promises to end state violence.\n\nThe same security forces accused of abuses under Hasina – including the paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion – remain operational.\n\nYunus has pledged to hold elections in February 2026, with a referendum on constitutional reforms on the same day."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1711-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On 17 November 2025, a wide array of global events unfolded, including the FAA's announcement of resumed airline schedules, U.S. military and political actions in Venezuela and the Caribbean, political threats in Bangladesh over an election ban, the use of social media in criminal investigations, a referendum in Ecuador on lifting a constitutional ban, warnings of ethnic cleansing in Gaza, internal conflict over U.S. foreign policy resolutions, a cybersecurity breach investigation, political fallout between Trump and Representative Greene, revelations about a controversial plan by Al-Majd Europe to remove Palestinians from Gaza, and a growing mental health crisis among children in war zones.

throttling of aid supplies.\n\nA source at Nasser Medical Complex told Al Jazeera on Sunday that three people had been killed after Israel bombed east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. That same day, Israel also struck Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood and areas close to the southern city of Rafah.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim al-Khalili said the Israeli army was still targeting locations inside the so-called  yellow line , which demarcates where troops have withdrawn as part of the ceasefire.\n\nAl-Khalili said the situation was “going from bad to worse” for families living near the yellow line, as the military continued to “demolish residential buildings” and “spread panic” while they contended with  heavy rains  flooding makeshift shelters.\n\nThe United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said that 13,000 families in Gaza whose homes were destroyed during two years of indiscriminate Israeli bombardment are now exposed to freezing temperatures and flooding in woefully inadequate shelters.\n\nUN data shows that more than 80 percent of all  buildings and housing units  in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war. But Israel continues to block the entry of tents and mobile homes into the enclave despite the ceasefire, which was meant to unleash a flow of aid to stricken residents.\n\nTamara Alrifai, UNRWA’s director of communications, said Israel had placed limitations on what could enter the enclave, banning certain items deemed to be of dual use that could potentially be used for military purposes. “Israel … would take out many items that are extremely needed, especially in this winter situation,” she said.\n\n“UNRWA is under double the amount of scrutiny and restrictions than other agencies despite being the largest agency there,” Alrifai said, adding that the UN agency has enough supplies to fill 6,000 aid trucks from its warehouses in Egypt and Jordan.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said: “It’s been raining for two days and people are telling us that everything has started to leak. Many of these displacement camps are at a different elevation to surrounding areas, allowing water to run in from all sides. Some areas are completely submerged.”\n\n“For people sheltering inside bombed-out buildings, everything is leaking, and there is a risk that with the heavy rains, the buildings could collapse. People who set up tents near the coast are at risk of strong tides washing away their tents,” he said.\n\nAbdulrahman Asaliyah, a displaced Palestinian in the city, told Al Jazeera: “All the tents have been flooded, people’s mattresses, their food, their water, their clothes. Everything has been soaked. We are calling for help for new tents that can at least protect people from the winter cold.”\n\nCaroline Seguin, Gaza emergency coordinator at Doctors Without Borders (known by its French acronym, MSF), said that many people were awakened by the floods and were afraid to go back to sleep. “In Gaza, it is a luxury to spend the night in a dry place,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nSeguin said Israel was still putting up barriers to much-needed aid entering the enclave. Bringing in supplies, including tents and medication, was still “very complicated”, she said, requiring “even more administrative processes” from the Israeli side.\n\nSince the start of the ceasefire agreement last month, at least 266 people have been killed and 635 wounded by Israeli attacks, adding to a grim toll now approaching 70,000 deaths.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday that he did not know how long the Gaza ceasefire would hold, adding that Israel was still expecting the remains of three captives to be returned by Hamas.\n\nHamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, has been undertaking efforts with the Red Cross to locate the remains of captives under mountains of rubble left behind by Israeli bombardment.\n\nNetanyahu also said that his opposition to a Palestinian state had “not changed one bit”, one day before the  UN Security Council votes  on a United States-drafted resolution mentioning a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood that would mandate an international stabilisation force in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli violence in the occupied West Bank continued unabated, with raids on two camps that left two young Palestinians dead.\n\nSoldiers shot Jadallah Jihad Jumaa Jadallah, a 15-year-old ninth-grade student, as they raided the Far’a camp, located south of the city of Tubas in the West Bank, preventing paramedics from assisting him, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.\n\nSeparately, the military also killed Hassan Sharkasi during a raid on the Askar refugee camp east of Nablus, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/dozens-killed-in-dr-congo-after-bridge-collapses-at-copper-cobalt-mine","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"00:54:04+00:00","title":"Dozens killed in DR Congo after bridge collapses at copper, cobalt mine","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bridge at the Kalando copper and cobalt mine in southeastern Lualaba province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo collapsed after wildcat miners—numbering over 10,000—rushed across it following a formal ban due to heavy rain and landslide risks.

foreign military bases, according to early  referendum  results, with a count of close to 90 percent of ballots showing nearly two-thirds voting “no” on the proposal.\n\nThe loss on Sunday was a blow to President Daniel Noboa, who has said foreign cooperation, including shared or foreign bases within the country, is central to fighting organised crime.\n\nA separate measure to convene an assembly to rewrite the constitution also had more than 61 percent rejection, with nearly 88 percent of votes counted.\n\nNoboa acknowledged the defeat in a post on X.\n\n“We respect the will of the Ecuadorian people,” he wrote.\n\n“Our commitment does not change; it strengthens. We will continue to fight tirelessly for the country that you deserve, with the tools that we have.”\n\nThe rejection blocks the United States military from returning to an airbase at Manta on the Pacific coast – once a hub for Washington’s anti-drug operations.\n\nEcuador banned foreign military bases on its soil in 2008.\n\nIn Sunday’s referendum, voters were also asked if Ecuador should cut public funding for political parties, and if the number of legislators in the nation’s congress – the National Assembly – should be reduced from 151 representatives to 73.\n\nThe early count showed those proposals failing by a large margin, too.\n\nThe referendum is taking place amid unprecedented violence in Ecuador, which has become a key transit point for cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru. Drug trafficking gangs have attacked presidential candidates, mayors and journalists, as they fight for control over ports and coastal cities.\n\nThe vote also comes as the US military conducts a series of air strikes against alleged drug smuggling boats, a divisive policy from President Donald Trump that Noboa has backed.\n\nAlessandro Rampietti, reporting from the Ecuadorian capital, Quito, said many voters had expressed concerns over sovereignty if foreign militaries return.\n\n“The main issue here is the sovereignty and the fact that this country has had experience of having military bases in the past. And there have been allegations of many abuses committed by the US soldiers when they were in the country, including the sinking of fishermen’s boats, and also an increase in prostitution in the towns near the bases, as well as mistreatment of locals by these soldiers, who had immunity,” Rampietti said.\n\n“So, it seems like a majority of people say no. They are saying we can do it with our police and our army. And that the problem is the corruption, the problem is that the laws in the country are not implemented.”\n\nFor its part, the US has praised Noboa as an “excellent partner” in efforts to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking, and Ecuadorean authorities said prior to the referendum that a “no” vote on the military bases question would not derail security plans.\n\nNoboa ratified two agreements for joint military operations with the US last year. The countries also maintain an aerial interception agreement, enabling drug and weapons seizures at sea.\n\nUS Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also recently toured military facilities in Manta and an airbase in Salinas alongside Noboa.\n\nSome voters may have also voted against the measures because of anger over Noboa’s recent cancellation of a popular diesel subsidy, which led to protests in some areas, according to analysts.\n\nThe result could weaken Noboa, said political analyst Cristian Carpio.\n\n“It was an erosion of his governance … because of the diesel issue, the protests and disinformation,” Carpio told the Reuters news agency.\n\nHe added that voters may also feel fatigued after two recent presidential elections and other referendum votes.\n\nIn office since November 2023, Noboa has deployed soldiers on the streets and in prisons, launched dramatic raids on drug strongholds, and declared frequent states of emergency.\n\nStill, in the first half of this year, there were 4,619 murders – the “highest in recent history”, according to Ecuador’s Organized Crime Observatory.\n\nJust as voting began, Noboa announced that the leader of the country’s most notorious gang, Los Lobos, had been captured.\n\nThe most-wanted drug kingpin known as “Pipo” had “faked his death, changed his identity and hid in Europe”, Noboa said on X.\n\nInterior Minister John Reimberg later said Pipo had been detained in Spain in a joint operation between Ecuadoran and Spanish police."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/who-is-marjorie-taylor-greene-trumps-maga-ally-turned-critic","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"17:09:55+00:00","title":"Who is Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump’s MAGA ally turned critic?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman from Georgia and former staunch ally of Donald Trump, has publicly broken from the president over policy disagreements, particularly regarding U.S. military support for Israel’s war on Gaza, the handling of Jeffrey Epstein’s sealed court files, and the rising cost of living.

Trump’s MAGA base, has increasingly been  expressing her disagreements , accusing the Trump administration of prioritising foreign policy over pressing domestic issues, such as a cost-of-living

A day later, he continued his broadside, calling her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party.\n\nIn response, Greene said Trump is coming after her “hard”, seeking to “scare all the other Republicans before next week’s vote to release the Epstein files”.\n\nOn Saturday, the Republican lawmaker  accused  Trump of putting her life in danger, saying his online criticism has triggered a wave of threats against her.\n\nSo who is Greene, and why has her relationship with Trump broken down? How will it impact the MAGA base?\n\nGreene’s interest in politics,  according to  the US broadcaster NBC News, began in 2016, when she began writing on topics supporting the far-right  QAnon conspiracy theories .\n\nShe was elected to represent Georgia’s 14th Congressional District in 2020.\n\nAs a member of the US House of Representatives since January 2021, Greene has been a staunch Trump supporter and also stood by the president during the  January 2021 Capitol Hill insurrection , which saw Trump supporters force their way into the US Capitol building to try to stop the certification of the presidential election victory of Trump rival and Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nGreene said “January 6 was just a riot” and defended it as a movement to “overthrow tyrants”. But after a backlash, she said she had been joking.\n\nGreene has been a vocal supporter of the conservative agenda in the US, calling herself anti-abortion, pro-gun and anti-immigration. She has backed the US building walls along its borders to prevent undocumented immigrants from entering the country.\n\nBorn Marjorie Taylor in Milledgeville, Georgia, in 1974, Greene graduated from the University of Georgia in 1996 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.\n\nShe then began working in her family’s company Taylor Commercial, a construction and renovation company, and in 2002, she and her husband at the time, Perry Greene, took over the business. In 2012, Marjorie entered the fitness sector and opened a CrossFit gym that she expanded and eventually sold.\n\nIn recent weeks, Greene has been critical of the US president’s policies, especially linked to the Epstein files, the cost of living crisis, healthcare and foreign policy.\n\nEpstein files : On Wednesday, US lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate, putting Trump’s relationship with the sex offender under scrutiny.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in prison in 2019 after being arrested on charges of sex trafficking of minors. Trump, who had a 15-year friendship with Epstein, denies all wrongdoing and has repeatedly stated that he was never involved in – or even knew about – Epstein’s sexual crimes.\n\nBut the US Department of Justice has repeatedly refused to release the court files, raising eyebrows – not least among Trump’s own Republican Party and MAGA base.\n\nGreene has been critical of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files and has repeatedly said all the files should be released.\n\n“The American people deserve full transparency into who was involved in these horrific acts,” she said on X on Thursday.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on releasing all remaining sealed court files pertaining to Epstein this week.\n\nCost of living:  In recent weeks, Greene has railed against Trump’s budget and spending policies and also accused Republicans of not paying enough attention to the cost of living crisis.\n\nSince Trump returned to the White House in January, he has insisted that he would bring prices down in the US by bringing in more revenue to the government by imposing tariffs. He has also repeatedly  said  inflation is not currently a serious concern for the US economy.\n\nAccording to  the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of September, grocery prices have risen every month since Trump took office.  According to  the US Energy Information Administration, the price of electricity bills has also risen.\n\nIn an  interview  with former Trump Press Secretary Sean Spencer on Friday, Greene said: “President Trump and his administration [do] deserve a lot of credit for lowering inflation and holding it steady, but that doesn’t bring prices down. And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping.”\n\n“It’s actually infuriating people because people know what they’re paying at the grocery store. They know what they’re paying for their kid’s clothes and school supplies. They know what they’re paying for their electricity bills,” she said.\n\nHealthcare costs : Greene has also accused Republicans of failing to grapple with rising healthcare costs, expressing her concerns about the issue as the government shutdown, the longest in US history, ended without a guarantee on tax credits for health insurance.\n\nDemocrats have proposed a bill for a three-year extension of the healthcare subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of this year.\n\n“When the tax credits expire this year, my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district,” she wrote in an X post on October 7.\n\n“Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” she added.\n\nTrump has proposed to send healthcare subsidies directly into people’s bank accounts.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly prioritised the interests of American citizens by promising more jobs and bringing down the cost of living.\n\nBut according to Greene, the president has not devoted time on domestic issues. She has been critical of US military support to Israel and became one of the first Republicans to call Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide.\n\nShe publicly took on Trump for military intervention in Iran in support of Israel.\n\nGreene has also been opposed to the Trump administration sending more weapons to Ukraine as Europe’s deadliest war since World War II rages on. In July after Trump approved more military support to Kyiv, Greene, said on X: “MAGA voted for no more US involvement in foreign wars.”\n\nIn August, she also expressed dissent against the Trump administration’s $20bn economic support to Argentina, accusing the government of ignoring its America First agenda.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News this month, she said: “We didn’t elect the president to go out there and travel the world and end the foreign wars.”\n\n“We elected the president to stop sending tax dollars and weapons for the foreign wars – to completely not engage any more,” she said, addeding: “One of the big campaign issues is Americans were fed up with foreign wars.”\n\nAnnouncing that he is withdrawing his endorsement of Greene in a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said all he sees “‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!”\n\n“She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore,” Trump said.\n\n“I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”\n\nHe also said she should not run for governor or senator of Georgia and accused Greene of going “far left” in her views.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Trump also defended his MAGA strategy and said MAGA was his idea. “I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else.”\n\nOn social media after the release of the Epstein files on Wednesday, he said it was a “hoax” by Democrats and said “a very bad or stupid Republican would fall into that trap.”\n\nResponding to Trump’s attack late on Friday, Greene said on X that she’s astonished about how hard Trump’s fighting “to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level”.\n\n“But really most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream,” she said, adding that’s what she voted for.\n\n“I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,” she said.\n\n“But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.”\n\nPresident Trump just attacked me and lied about me. I haven’t called him at all, but I did send these text messages today. Apparently this is what sent him over the edge.\n\nThe Epstein files.\n\nAnd of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other…  pic.twitter.com/EcUzaohZZs\n\n— Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG)  November 15, 2025\n\nMany MAGA supporters have expressed their support to Greene after Trump’s attack against her.\n\n“I respect President Trump but I stand with my Congresswoman @mtgreenee,”  said  Emory Roy, who works for Turning Point Action, the organisation founded by Trump supporter Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed in September.\n\n“While we are seeing progress under President Trump’s Administration, I know the people of NWGA [Northwest Georgia] will stop at nothing until we get back to the founding principles that made this country so great,” she added.\n\nSome MAGA users also began expressing their discontent with Trump after the feud.\n\n“I voted for Trump three times and I regret it. I will not be voting for him in the midterms. I hope he loses,” one X user  said  on Saturday.\n\nAnother X user shared a similar view and  said : “He’s lost his way from maga.”\n\nGreene has been a controversial figure, known for a combative style of dealing with politicians as well as journalists.\n\nShe told a journalist to “f*** off” during an interview last year. After then-British Foreign Secretary David Cameron urged the US to back Ukraine, Greene said: “David Cameron needs to worry about his own country and, frankly, he can kiss my a**.”\n\nGreene has faced criticism for her support for QAnon before being elected to Congress in 2020, even though she insists she has distanced herself from the ideology.\n\nOne of her theories included the claim that 9/11 was an inside job and there is no evidence that a plane had crashed.\n\n“Some people claimed a missile hit the Pentagon. I now know that is not correct. The problem is our government lies to us so much to protect the Deep State, it’s hard sometimes to know what is real and what is not,” she  said  on X in 2020.\n\nBut a month after becoming a member of the House, she  said : “9/11 absolutely happened. I remember that day, crying all day long, watching it on the news. And it’s a tragedy for anyone to say it didn’t happen. So that I definitely want to tell you all, I do not believe it’s fake.”\n\nShortly before being elected to the House, she said: “Muslims do not belong in government.”\n\nIn 2021, she posted an Islamophobic thread on X,  saying : “It’s not irrational to fear Islamic terrorism or a religion that states it’s goal is world domination and the death of infidels,” drawing condemnation from House members.\n\nIn 2021, she was stripped of her House committee assignments over her past incendiary comments and her apparent support for violence against Democrats.\n\nGreene has also been called out by House members for her racist views towards Black people.\n\nAccording to  a June 2020 Politico report, Greene called Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists “idiots” and compared them to neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members. The BLM movement, which highlights racial inequalities in the US, began after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a police officer in the US in June 2020 during an arrest.\n\nGreene has also been accused of expressing anti-Semitic views. According to US media reports, in 2018, she had said in a Facebook post that the wildfires in California could have been caused by an international cabal tied to Jews. She has since deleted the post.\n\nIn 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she compared anti-COVID measures such as wearing masks to the yellow stars Jews were forced to wear during the Nazi era.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the time condemned her views.\n\n“Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling,” McCarthy posted on X."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/somalia-confirms-major-data-breach-in-electronic-visa-system","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"17:17:10+00:00","title":"Somalia confirms major data breach in electronic visa system","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Somalia’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency confirmed a major data breach in its electronic visa system, exposing personal data of at least 35,000 people—including thousands of American citizens—after hackers penetrated the platform.

informed directly.\n\nHowever, the statement did not indicate how many people were affected, nor did it give any sense of how long the process might take.\n\nThe government has since quietly moved its

presidential election  is heading to a run-off in December, in a showdown between leftist former Labour Minister  Jeannette Jara  and far-right leader Jose Antonio Kast.\n\nWith about 83 percent of ballots counted on Sunday, Jara led with 26.71 percent, followed by Kast on 24.12 percent, according to the electoral authority, Servel.\n\nPresident Gabriel Boric, in a statement from the presidential office in Santiago, recognised Jara and Kast as the front-runners headed to the second round on December 14. He also congratulated both candidates, calling it a “spectacular day of democracy”.\n\nEight candidates appeared on Sunday’s ballot, but would have needed to get 50 percent plus one vote to win the election outright.\n\nDespite leading in the first round, Jara, 51, faces  an uphill battle  in which her rivals are throwing support around Kast, founder of the far-right Republican Party.\n\nSunday’s election was dominated by growing public anxiety over surging murders, kidnappings and extortion in what has long been one of Latin America’s safest countries.\n\nJara, a minister under Boric, has promised to hire more police, lift banking secrecy to tackle organised crime and tackle cost-of-living issues.\n\nKast, 59, has pledged to build walls, fences and trenches along Chile’s border with Bolivia to keep out migrants and asylum seekers from poorer countries to the north, such as Venezuela.\n\nSpeaking from Santiago after Boric’s statement, Jara thanked supporters and urged Chileans not to let fears over rising crime drive them into the arms of the far right in the run-off.\n\n“Don’t let fear harden your hearts,” the politician said, insisting that the answer to crime was not to “come up with ideas, each more radical than the next” and hide behind bulletproof glass.\n\nThe comments were a dig at Kast’s draconian campaign security measures.\n\nFor his part, Kast, in his address to supporters, called for unity and promised to “rebuild” Chile after four years of centre-left rule, which he termed “maybe the worst government in Chile’s democratic history”.\n\nMaverick economist Franco Parisi caused surprise by finishing third on 19.42 percent, ahead of ultra-right lawmaker Johannes Kaiser on 13.93 percent, and former conservative mayor Evelyn Matthei on 12.70 percent.\n\nParisi refrained from backing either Jara or Kast in the run-off, saying that they both needed to go look for new voters “on the street”.\n\nThe next-closest contender, Kaiser, conceded defeat and announced his endorsement of Kast, while Matthei, another conservative who won about 13 percent of votes, quickly followed suit, citing the “absolutely uncontrolled arrival” of migrants and claiming Chile needed a “sharp change of direction”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Lucia Newman, reporting from Santiago, said supporters at Kast’s headquarters were euphoric.\n\n“There seems to be confidence that even though he came in second place by a slim margin, he will be the first to cross the finish line in the run-off next month. These people say that it is time for a deep change in this country,” Newman said. “They say the main problems are crime, delinquency, a slow and stagnant economy and also just the fact that there has been the same people governing this country for too long, and say that it’s time for a major overhaul.”\n\nThe dominance of law-and-order issues in Sunday’s election has marked a drastic change from the wave of left-wing optimism and hopes of drafting a new constitution that brought Gabriel Boric, who isn’t allowed to run for re-election, to power.\n\nThe rising crime has been widely attributed to foreign criminal groups, coinciding with a doubling of Chile’s migrant population since 2017. Migrants now make up 8.8 percent of the country’s residents.\n\nWall-to-wall news coverage of crime has led to a clamour among voters for a “mano dura” or iron fist.\n\nRodrigo Arellano, an analyst at Chile’s University for Development, called the results “very bad news” for Jara and said it seemed “unlikely” she could win the December 14 run-off.\n\n“Not only is her vote count low, but the combined total of the opposition candidates is almost more than double hers,” he told the AFP news agency, blaming anti-incumbent and anticommunist sentiment.\n\nJara’s candidacy is considered historic in contemporary Chilean politics, in part because of her working-class background and in part because she represents the Communist Party, which has not seen such broad support since Chile’s return to democracy.\n\nJara, who led an effort to  reduce the work week  from 45 hours to 40, has campaigned on affordability, pledging to increase Chile’s minimum wage and make housing more affordable. She has also made efforts to distance herself from Boric’s administration, even hinting at a possible break from her Communist Party if elected president.\n\nKast, frequently compared to United States President Donald Trump, founded Chile’s Republican Party in 2019 and is widely credited for bringing extreme right positions to the national stage. He lost to Boric in the 2021 presidential election.\n\nHe has repeatedly denied reports that his father was a supporter of the Nazi party, describing him instead as a forced conscript in the German army.\n\nVoter turnout on Sunday was significantly higher than in the previous 2021 presidential election, as voting was mandatory for all 15.7 million registered voters.\n\nChileans also voted for members of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate on the same day.\n\nThe governing leftist coalition currently has a minority in both chambers, and right-wing majorities in both could set the stage for Congress and the presidency to be controlled by the right for the first time since the end of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship in 1990.\n\nThe election is being closely watched as a gauge of the broader fortunes of South America’s left, which has recently suffered setbacks in countries like Argentina and Bolivia.\n\nLast month, a centre-right president was elected in neighbouring Bolivia after 20 years of socialist rule. Right-wing candidates look likely to win presidential elections in Colombia and Peru next year, while the left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is predicted to face a close battle to retain his office in Brazil despite ex-president Jair Bolsonaro’s sentencing for leading a failed coup."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/16/whats-the-shadowy-organisation-taking-gaza-palestinians-to-south-africa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:18:48Z","title":"What’s the shadowy organisation taking Gaza Palestinians to South Africa?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A chartered flight carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza, many without travel documents or knowledge of their destination, landed in Johannesburg, South Africa, after a 12-hour delay.

Palestinians to South Africa?\n\nOn Thursday morning, a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from war-torn Gaza – many without the required travel documents – landed at an airport near Johannesburg, leaving South African officials “blindsided”.\n\nAfter nearly 12 hours of scrambling, the group was allowed to disembark into the care of a local charity organisation.\n\nMore details have emerged about the scheme run by “Al-Majd Europe”, through which activists argue Israel is advancing its ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian passengers were charged a hefty sum of money by the organisation, which says on its website that it coordinates “evacuations from conflict zones”.\n\nHere is everything we know about the group’s transit so far and who’s behind Al-Majd Europe.\n\nThe plane full of people sat on a runway for nearly 12 hours while South African authorities tried to figure out why they did not have exit stamps or slips from when they left Gaza, according to officials from South Africa’s border agency.\n\nThey were also not sure when asked by immigration where they would stay or how long they planned to be in South Africa.\n\nThe government allowed them to leave the plane after charity organisation Gift of the Givers offered to accommodate them.\n\nOfficials said 23 Palestinians flew to other countries, without adding any more details.\n\n“These are people from Gaza who somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi and came here,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Friday.\n\nHe added that “it does seem like they were being flushed out” of Gaza. South Africa’s intelligence services are investigating the incident.\n\nBehind the flight is Al-Majd Europe, which is accused of acting in coordination with Israeli authorities.\n\nThe Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported on Sunday that the organisation is led by a dual Israeli-Estonian national named as Tomer Janar Lind. The daily said that Lind worked with a unit in the Israeli military charged with the forced transfer of Palestinians from Gaza to facilitate several such flights.\n\nThis unit, which is named the Voluntary Emigration Bureau, was set up in early 2025 under the Israeli defence ministry to enact a policy of pushing out Palestinians from their homeland.\n\nAccording to Haaretz report, Lind does not deny arranging flights for Palestinians but refused to divulge more information.\n\n“This is not at all a random event,” said Oroub el-Abed, associate professor in international migration and refugee studies at the Birzeit University in Ramallah.\n\n“This is very much part of a long colonial pattern, very systematic dispossession of indigenous Palestinians that has been perpetuated by Zionist Israelis and they want to empty the land from its indigenous people, using multi-faceted approaches,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Al-Majd Europe website says it was founded in 2010 in Germany, and the homepage has a pop-up warning about individuals pretending to be its agents, sharing phone numbers of “legitimate representatives”.\n\nBut the site itself has no address or phone number, providing just a location in Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem. However, Al Jazeera was not able to find an office there.\n\nThe website domain, almajdeurope.org, was only registered in February this year, while several links on the site lead nowhere. The email listed, info@almajdeurope.org, bounces back an automated message saying it does not exist.\n\nNamecheap, which registered the domain, has been cited in several cybersecurity reports on online fraud because of its low-cost, easy sign-up process.\n\nAl Jazeera has also learned that many people were told to pay via bank transfers to personal, not organisational, accounts.\n\nAmong the links that work is a page with four “Impact Stories”.\n\nOne post about “Mona”, a 29-year-old from Aleppo, Syria, is dated March 22, 2023, even though the website was only registered 10 months later.\n\nThe narrative, written in “Mona’s” voice, expresses gratitude to Al-Majd for moving her and her mother “to a safe place” when they felt threatened in Lebanon, where they fled to in 2013.\n\nThe photo, however, shows Abeer Khayat, who was 33 when photographed by journalist Madeline Edwards in December 2024 in Tripoli, Lebanon, for Middle East Eye.\n\nThe online form reads: “For Gaza residents currently inside the Gaza Strip only!\n\n“Do you aspire to travel and start a new life? We are here to help you!”\n\nThe Palestinian families, with a pregnant woman among them, boarded the plane not knowing their final destination, having paid Al-Majd $1,400 to $2,000 each – the price for children the same as adults.\n\nLoay Abu Saif, who was on board the plane along with his wife and children, told Al Jazeera on Friday that he had heard about Al Majd through a social media advertisement.\n\nSaif said he hadn’t known when they would leave Gaza until a day before, when he was told passengers could only take a small bag, a mobile phone, and some cash.\n\nThey were taken by bus from southern Gaza’s Rafah to the Karem Abu Salem crossing (known as Kerem Shalom in Israel), where they were checked, then transferred to Israel’s Ramon Airport, without Israeli authorities stamping their travel documents.\n\nAnother person interviewed by Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity said: “The … applicant must [have a young] family. [Then] the names are sent for security screening. Once that’s completed, and if the family is approved, they’re asked to pay,” he said.\n\n“There had been prior coordination with the Israeli army for the buses to enter Rafah,” he said. “The process was only routine.”\n\nThe group left from Ramon in a Romanian aircraft and transited through Nairobi, Kenya, before landing in Johannesburg.\n\nHaaretz, the Israeli daily, reported that there had been a similar flight on May 27. It said some 57 Palestinians from Gaza boarded buses that took them to the Ramon Airport via  the Karem Abu Salem crossing.\n\nAccording to Haaretz, the group then boarded a Romanian chartered plane operated by Fly Lili. The plane went to Budapest, and from there they continued to Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nAl-Majd’s website also claims to have facilitated a trip for “a group of doctors working in hospitals in the Gaza Strip” who it flew to Indonesia “for further studies and advanced medical training”. However, this post is dated April 28, 2024.\n\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify the authenticity of this post and a photograph of the group in it.\n\nGift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman, who alleged that Al-Majd was one of “Israel’s front organisations”, told AP that this was the second plane to arrive in South Africa.\n\nAnother plane arrived with more than 170 Palestinians on board on October 28, but that flight was not announced by authorities.\n\nThe Palestinian Embassy in South Africa said in a statement that the flight was arranged by “an unregistered and misleading organization that exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner”.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Palestinians, especially those in the Gaza Strip, about networks that seek to remove them from their homes in line with Israeli interests."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1362","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"01:19:36+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,362","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 17, 2025, Russia’s Novorossiysk port resumed oil exports after a two-day suspension caused by a Ukrainian missile and drone attack, which is considered the most damaging so far to Russia’s Black Sea crude export infrastructure.

rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have recorded the most powerful flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a comprehensive social media ban for children under 16, expanding the list to include Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has released a report warning that the world’s 'fossil fuel obsession' is threatening the lives of billions, with over 2 billion people living near active fossil fuel sites and more than 3,500 new sites under development.

urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations.

2025-11-12T02:12:47+00:00\n\nTitle: California’s Gavin Newsom slams Trump absence at COP30 climate conference\n\nOne of the most notable absences at this week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference reflects the leadership of one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world: the United States.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has declined to send any top-level officials to Belem, Brazil, for this year’s edition of the annual event, known as COP30.\n\nBut in Trump’s absence, state and local officials have arrived to reaffirm the US commitment to climate change policies — and to take shots at the Republican leader.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those politicians took centre stage: California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump’s longtime sparring partner in the Democratic Party. He is widely speculated to be a contender for the 2028 presidential elections.\n\nAppearing on a series of panels, Newsom denounced the Trump administration’s lack of representation at COP30 as an abdication of duty.\n\n“I  come here with humility, coming from the United States. I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together,” Newsom said at a ministerial meeting.\n\n“It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace. But rather than complaining about it, we’re trying to do something about it.”\n\nHe pitched his leadership as a contrast to Trump’s and sought to position California’s efforts as having bipartisan appeal.\n\nIn touting California as an innovator in clean energy initiatives, Newsom cited Republican leaders from the state, including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as spearheading efforts to reduce water and air pollution.\n\n“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference, and I want you to know that we recognise our responsibility, and we recognise our opportunity,” Newsom told the COP30 audience.\n\nNewsom’s comments come at a critical juncture in his political career: Limited to two terms as governor, he is slated to exit office after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Democratic leader has spent his final years as California’s governor building an increasingly national and international profile. In 2023, for instance, he travelled to China, also on the premise of forging international bonds to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd during the 2024 presidential race, he emerged as a gadfly to challenge Republican policies. He faced Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in a televised Fox News debate and served as a prominent surrogate for the scuttled campaign of then-President Joe Biden, who exited the race over concerns about his age.\n\nTrump, the victor in the 2024 race, has repeatedly taken aim at Newsom since his inauguration in January.\n\nThe two politicians have clashed over wildfire suppression, immigration policies and Trump’s decision to deploy federal troops to US cities. Trump even gave the California governor one of his trademark nicknames — “Newscum” — and mused in June that it would be a “great thing” if the Democrat were arrested.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, took aim at Trump’s international and domestic policies at Tuesday’s climate conference.\n\nBy failing to send representation to COP30, Newsom argued that the US had created an opening for China, the country’s economic and political rival, to exert greater power on the global stage.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said.\n\nWhile Trump has used tariffs on foreign imports as a tool to combat China’s growing sway, Newsom maintained that, by stepping away from climate initiatives and clean energy technology, the US was losing ground economically.\n\n“This is not about electric power. This is about economic power. And we, in the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China,” Newsom said.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his opposition to emission-lowering policies, going so far as to claim that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job”, a position that disregards the scientific consensus linking fossil fuel usage to long-term effects on the global climate.\n\nAt September’s UN General Assembly, for instance,  Trump asserted  that countries around the world had been “devastated” by the “fake energy catastrophe”.\n\nHe also berated world leaders for attempting to impose policies that capped carbon emissions.\n\n“All these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said.\n\n“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nTrump had campaigned for re-election with the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill”, and since returning to the White House, he has sought to make good on his pledge to open federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Newsom appeared in Brazil, The Washington Post newspaper revealed that the Trump administration is weighing a draft proposal to allow offshore drilling along the California coastline.\n\nSuch activity has largely tapered off in recent decades, due to high-profile oil spills, and California prohibits new oil rigs within state waters, but that area is limited to the waters within three miles – or about 4.8km – of the shore.\n\nDemocrats, including US Representative Mike Levin, have sought to pass legislation to protect the state’s coastline from further drilling, but to no avail. But Newsom on Tuesday said that Trump’s proposal was “dead on arrival”.\n\nHe also questioned why news of the drilling proposal broke during the COP30 meeting.\n\n“He intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.\n\nHe pointed out that offshore drilling faces bipartisan opposition in Trump’s adopted home of Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort sits on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“ I also think it remarkable that he didn’t promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” Newsom said, signalling a double standard. “That says everything about Donald Trump.”\n\nNewsom’s broadside against Trump briefly reached beyond his opposition to the Republican president’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s  repeated air strikes  against maritime vessels alleged to be drug-smuggling boats, Newsom delivered a fiery invective.\n\n“What happened to due process? What happened to the rule of law?” Newsom asked. “I believe in the rule of law. I don’t believe in the rule of Don. That’s what we’re up against in the United States of America. I don’t want to lose my republic.”\n\nSince September 2, the Trump administration has carried out at least  19 known air strikes  in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nNo evidence has been provided publicly to justify the bombing campaign, and the identities of the deceased remain unknown.\n\nLegal experts have denounced the attacks as a form of extrajudicial killing, and leaders at the United Nations have called for an end to the military campaign as a violation of the UN Charter.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the violence as necessary to interrupt drug trafficking into the US. It has also moved to label cartels in Latin America as “international terrorist organisations” and “enemy combatants”.\n\nBut Newsom argued that such actions were unacceptable, and called on the international community to stand up to Trump.\n\n“Our politics needs to change, and I hope our international partners understand that,” he said. “It’s chilling to me to see those scenes of the United States of America blowing up boats with no transparency, no advice and consent with the United States Congress.”\n\nAt another COP30 event, entitled “America Is All In”, Newsom doubled down on his call for political change in the US, underscoring that Trump’s power is “temporary”.\n\n“ He’s an invasive species. He’s a wrecking ball president,” Newsom said.\n\nWhen pressed for solutions that would connect with voters, the California governor encouraged world leaders to find a unifying approach, particularly when it comes to combatting climate change scepticism.\n\nEmission-lowering goals — like limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius — felt abstract to most of his constituents, Newsom argued.\n\n“I think we have to use different language,” he said. “The vast majority of my audience doesn’t know what Celsius is.  You’re talking 1.5 degrees Celsius. How many more degrees is that in Fahrenheit? We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. Where are they? Do they float in the sky, or where do they land?\n\n“We don’t understand. We have to use better metaphors. We have to change our language.”\n\nBut the California governor was coy when asked about his own ambitions to potentially succeed Trump as president. “I’m not going to take the bait,” he said to laughter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that President Donald Trump has instructed the Department of War to restart nuclear weapons testing, sparking concern that this could signal a return to full explosive nuclear tests.

tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to enter the solar system, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

2025-11-07T07:49:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpkenx9dzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"00:06:44.201+00:00","title":"How my on-air 'brain fog' moment sparked a big debate","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A BBC journalist's experience of brain fog during a live broadcast on BBC News at Ten sparked a global conversation about the impact of menopause-related hormonal changes on cognitive function and professional performance.

brain fog at work on the social network LinkedIn last week, I had no idea that it would have such an enormous impact.\n\nIt's been  viewed  hundreds of thousands of times. Women have stopped me on the street to talk to me about it.\n\nI've been overwhelmed by hundreds of messages from people sharing support and their own experiences of it.\n\nUsually I cover technology news. But given the response, it felt important to talk about this as well.\n\n\"Brain fog\" isn't a medical term. But you may well know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nThat moment when you suddenly can't remember the word for something really obvious, or you're mid-sentence and you lose your train of thought. It's infuriating, and it can be embarrassing.\n\nWhere was I?\n\nAh yes, for me, as a woman in my 40s, it's coincided with perimenopause – the stage in my life where my hormone levels are changing. There can of course be other neurological conditions for which brain fog can be a symptom too.\n\nIf you're in a job where public speaking is part of what you do, it can be particularly terrifying.\n\n\"I've spent 30 years being professionally articulate,\" wrote Janet Edgecombe, an internal communications expert.\n\n\"All of a sudden I'm forgetting the words for basic things. 'That grey thing in the thingy that we cook chicken on'. My husband replies 'oh, the baking tray in the oven'. Hmm. 'Yeah, that thing'.\"\n\nI also heard from teachers, start-up founders having to present pitches for money to investors, women running workshops, delivering speeches – and fellow journalists trying to report live on-air, like me. But of course it can also hit mid-conversation, in a more intimate but no less frustrating way.\n\nMy post was about my decision to hold a page of notes on the BBC News at Ten. A story had broken late in the afternoon, following an already busy day, and by the time we reached 10pm, I knew I was getting tired and I could feel the brain fog.\n\nI was going to talk about an outage that was affecting dozens of websites and apps, and I planned to use the technical jargon for it, as given by the company affected, and then explain what it actually meant.\n\nBut I just couldn't get the phrase to stick in my head and I knew that without it, I wouldn't manage the rest of what I needed to say.\n\nI was reporting live from Glasgow. Like many of my professional peers, I do not have, and I've never had, autocue. And so, for the first time, I decided at the last minute to hold a page of notes with the offending phrase on it.\n\nIt felt to me at the time like an admission of failure. I have been trained never to use notes – unless there's a specific legal reason why the wording of a statement, for example, has to be precise, or there are a lot of figures to remember.\n\nEven then, I have prided myself on having a good enough short-term memory to get me through.\n\nUsing notes is discouraged in the world of public speaking. They are not permitted to anyone giving a 12-minute TED talk. The speaker is expected to memorise their speech.\n\nLooking down the barrel of the camera and clutching that paper, live on TV, felt tough.\n\nBut around 10% of women report  leaving their jobs  due to menopause symptoms, according to the Fawcett Society. And research by insurance firm Royal London found that half of women going through it have  considered giving up work.  I don't want to do that – and so I stuck with my solution.\n\nTo my intense relief, some people said they thought my paper looked authoritative, that they just assumed it was a breaking story and the page contained fresh information. Others asked why I hadn't used a device instead – I suppose I thought the potential of having to fumble with a screen would feel even worse.\n\n\"Let's start a movement: Hold your notes,\" wrote Elisheva Marcus, vice president of communications at the venture capitalist firm Earlybird.\n\nAnd so, the hashtag holdthenotes was born.\n\n\"Have you ever checked your testosterone levels?\" menopause expert Dr Louise Newson asked me.\n\nShe says testosterone – despite its reputation for being a male hormone, and its association with sex drive and libido, is actually an essential brain chemical for both men and women, and levels fall in both genders. One of the results is brain fog.\n\n\"It's like you've been drugged,\" she says. \"It's really scary, a lot of people worry they've got dementia.\"\n\n\"I remember when I had my levels done 10 years ago, and I was like 'Thank God, at least I know why I'm feeling so awful'.\"\n\nShe adds that there are studies dating back to the 1940s indicating that testosterone can improve brain function and  wellbeing in women  as well as men, but the randomised control studies, where participants are given either a placebo or the product itself in order to see whether it really works, have only focused on improvements to libido.\n\nNHS-prescribed  Hormone Replacement Therapy,  or HRT, is traditionally a combination of oestrogen and progesterone. Testosterone is not routinely included.\n\nInstead doctors can separately prescribe testosterone to female patients, at lower doses than given to men.\n\nThere are also a myriad of menopause supplements which claim to ease symptoms including brain fog. Estimates vary but it's a multi-billion dollar industry and its booming.\n\nWomen spend an average  of £147 per year on supplements  to try to alleviate their menopause symptoms, according to a survey earlier this year by the nutrition news website NutraIngredients.\n\n\"They might help a bit,\" says Dr Newson.\n\n\"I do yoga every day, and that helps my brain become clear and focused, but I have a hormone deficiency, I can't eat my way out of it, or exercise my way out of it.\n\n\"A lot of women spend a fortune trying to improve symptoms of a hormone deficiency with something else.\"\n\nDr Joshua Chen is part of the Harvard Medical School-Massachusetts General Hospital Photobiomodulation Research Group. The team is looking at how frequencies of red light can change the mitochondria inside the brain to improve focus.\n\nHe describes it as \"like a face mask, but for the brain\". It can also, he says, be applied to the Vagus nerve on the neck to reduce stress.\n\nHe has founded a company called Niraxx which markets a headband called a neuro espresso, which is designed to be worn for up to 20 minutes a day. He claims the results are instant. It has to be plugged in – there are no batteries in the device for safety reasons.\n\nAngela Marsh is a registered nurse and a menopause coach. She says her clients often describe brain fog as feeling like they are \"living life in soft focus\".\n\n\"I don't think brain fog is taken seriously enough at all,\" she says.\n\n\"Many women feel deeply unsettled by the changes they experience. They think there's something wrong with them or they're 'losing it' when in fact there's a clear biological reason.\"\n\nAs for me – well, I've booked a blood test to check my hormone levels. I'm going to try some red-light therapy. And you are probably going to see me holding notes a bit more often."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpy7envr5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"06:29:28.396+00:00","title":"I heat my Essex home with a data centre in the shed","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Essex couple, Terrence and Lesley Bridges, have become the first in the UK to heat their home using a small data centre — the HeatHub — installed in their garden shed.

You can't fault the heating system – it is a 100% improvement on what we had before.\"\n\n\"You don't need to go to a sauna after coming here,\" Mrs Bridges, 75, adds.\n\nThe HeatHub was developed by Thermify and is part of UK Power Networks'  SHIELD project , which aims to come up with innovative ways for low-income households to transition to net zero.\n\nThrough SHIELD, the Bridges also had solar panels and a battery put in, which have contributed to their savings.\n\nMr Bridges, a retired RAF sergeant, says despite putting \"the heating up fairly high to keep it nice and warm\", his bill has fallen to between £40 and £60 each month.\n\n\"I think it's fantastic because it's eco-friendly,\" he continues, \"we're not burning any gases, so it's green – it's environmentally friendly.\"\n\nThermify co-founder and CEO Travis Theune says the Bridges' HeatHub will eventually be part of a \"remote and distributed\" data centre, involving many units processing data for customers.\n\nWhile not designed for the heavy processing needed for artificial intelligence, Mr Theune says the system could run things like apps or analyse large volumes of data.\n\nHe says the company wanted to design a system to provide both \"clean\" and \"affordable\" energy because \"finding a way to do both was a hard problem\".\n\nThe project is still in the pilot phase, but in the future, clients will pay Thermify to process their data using the HeatHubs.\n\nMr Theune adds the system provides \"clean, green heat at a low-to-no price point\" because \"the electricity that's generating that heat is paid for by somebody else\".\n\nThe Bridges' landlord, social housing provider Eastlight Community Homes, is also part of SHIELD.\n\nDaniel Greenwood, Eastlight's head of asset management, says he hopes the next phase of the project will see 50 homes get HeatHubs, and adds: \"We've seen great results for the current installation, and although this is the first of its kind, we're looking to roll that out more broadly.\"\n\nJack McKellar, UK Power Networks’ innovation programme manager, says: \"We don't want anyone to miss out on the benefits of new and emerging technologies, as the UK moves towards a greener future.\"\n\nData centres help run the modern world. It is estimated they consume about 2.5% of the UK's electricity, and as more are built, their power demand could rise fourfold by 2030.\n\nThermify is not alone in trying to capture and use the heat generated by data centres.\n\nA  swimming pool in Devon  is being warmed by a washing machine-sized \"digital boiler\".\n\nThe company behind that scheme is also involved in a proposal to build the  Melbourn Energy Superloop  – a combined solar-powered data centre and district heat network in south Cambridgeshire.\n\nMilton Keynes University Hospital  was also hoping  to be the first place in the city to benefit from £95m plans to share heat from a new data centre.\n\nAccording to the  International Energy Agency , data centres use up to 30% of their electricity consumption on cooling.\n\nMike Richardson, the 66-year-old founder and owner of DSM, says he had tried to incorporate \"nature\" as much as possible into his data centre at a former RAF base just off the A1 near Peterborough.\n\nA 200kW array of solar panels helps power it, and a 500 cubic-metre artificial lake cools it down.\n\nThe lake is filled with water collected from the roof of an old aircraft hangar and pumped from two boreholes.\n\nFour heat exchangers are submerged in the 1.7 metre deep water, which is also home to dozens of koi carp and tench – fish that have their own role in the operation.\n\n\"We need to keep the pipes clean, and they eat the algae,\" Mr Richardson tells the BBC.\n\nWith a 400kW capacity, the data centre is relatively small – or \"boutique\", according to Mr Richardson.\n\nWarm water is pumped from data racks to heat exchangers in the lake, then the cooled water is sent back inside, in a closed loop.\n\nTraditional cooling systems often rely on compressing a chemical coolant, which can be toxic.\n\n\"Keeping away from chemicals is an important thing for us,\" Mr Richardson says.\n\nHe adds that because there was no need for compression, the setup used much less electricity for cooling.\n\nDoes it work?\n\n\"Yes, it works – it most definitely works,\" Mr Richardson says.\n\nBut adds that relying on nature comes with \"challenges\" because \"nature by default is not something which is, you know, stable\".\n\n\"It takes a bit of management, but it's all doable,\" he continues.\n\nThe system, while small-scale, can be scaled up with a larger body of water, he explains.\n\n\"Water is one of the best mediums for heat transfer,\" he says.\n\nMicrosoft has also experimented with an underwater data centre.\n\nProject Natick  saw more than 850 servers sunk in a giant metal tube off the coast of Orkney between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThere are  reports  that Chinese companies were also planning to sink data centres into the ocean.\n\nFollow East of England news on  X ,  Instagram  and Facebook:  BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks ,  BBC Cambridgeshire ,  BBC Essex ,  BBC Norfolk ,  BBC Northamptonshire  or  BBC Suffolk ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxr3w2464eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"02:08:21.721+00:00","title":"US to designate Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles as terrorists","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US State Department, under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has announced plans to designate Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) starting 24 November 2025.

The US hasn't published evidence publicly of Maduro's direct involvement in drug trafficking.\n\nBut its characterisation of Maduro as a drug-trafficker is seen as a way for the US to possibly justify targeting him or those close to him personally as part of its military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking.\n\nSpeculation is mounting about whether the US may strike land targets inside Venezuela as part of efforts to put pressure on Maduro.\n\nIn October, Maduro accused the US of  \"fabricating a new war\" , after it ordered the USS Gerald Ford to be sent to the Caribbean.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he has \"sort of\" made up his mind about what to do but has not announced his decision yet.\n\nHe told reporters on Sunday night that he asked Rubio to discuss the situation with Congress.\n\nHe added that \"we may be having some discussions\" with Maduro and that \"Venezuela wants to talk\", but did not provide further details on when talks might happen.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach toward Maduro, who returned to office in January following allegations of vote-rigging.\n\n\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio said in his statement.\n\nIn August, the US government increased a reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m (£37.2m), alleging he was a leading \"narco-trafficker\".\n\nThe US has also criticised Venezuela as inadequately addressing cartel activity, which Trump says is responsible for an influx of fentanyl into the US.\n\nThere is not evidence to suggest fentanyl comes from Venezuela, as it is primarily produced in Mexico with chemicals largely sourced from Asia.\n\nThe Venezuelan government acknowledges some cocaine trafficking takes place in the country, but there are much bigger trafficking hubs in the region. Cocaine is predominantly produced in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.\n\nSince September, the US has carried out a series of airstrikes on boats off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nThe US has sent the largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades and has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels, killing at least 83 people.\n\nThe administration has previously designated cartels in other countries as terrorist groups."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2kgvnqyzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"03:35:26.488+00:00","title":"Australian Paralympic gold medallist Paige Greco dies at 28","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paige Greco, a 28-year-old Australian para-cyclist with cerebral palsy, died suddenly at her home in Adelaide.

2025-11-16T13:33:18.710+00:00\n\nTitle: US-South Korea nuclear submarine deal: What does it mean?\n\nSouth Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States.\n\nThe US has approved the \"attack submarines\" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the agreement.\n\nThe agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding.\n\nIn a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had \"given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel\".\n\nIn an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha.\n\nOnly six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India.\n\nSouth Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster.\n\n\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nSouth Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure.\n\nAnd so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports.\n\nThe latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme.\n\nPresident Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose.\n\nIn a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a \"proud achievement\" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North.\n\nThe stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"awake at night\", he added.\n\nNorth Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials.\n\nIn March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard.\n\nPyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years.\n\nNorth Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme.\n\nJo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race.\n\n\"North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,\" she told the BBC. \"[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension.\"\n\nIt is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts.\n\nYang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat.\n\n\"South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,\" Dr Yang said. \"What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines.\"\n\nDr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.\n\nJo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a \"major change\" which \"means South Korea is now a regional player\".\n\n\"The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,\" she said. \"It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries.\"\n\nFor Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China.\n\n\"Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,\" Dr Yang explained. \"South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea.\"\n\nUS and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing must be \"furious\" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said.\n\nFollowing the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would \"deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides\".\n\nDai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that \"the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive\".\n\nAlthough President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline.\n\nSouth Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did \"not have the capability\" to build such vessels, according to reports.\n\nHanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter.\n\nBut now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2emyz0zpxko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"00:16:13.269+00:00","title":"Haditha: Two US marines implicated in killing family in notorious Iraq war shooting, expert tells BBC","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A BBC investigation into the 2005 Haditha massacre in Iraq reveals new evidence implicating two US Marines, Lance Corporal Humberto Mendoza and Lance Corporal Stephen Tatum, in the killing of 24 Iraqi civilians, including children and women.

Inside the back bedroom, a colourful bedspread covers the bed where her family was shot.\n\nThis is where she hid with her five siblings, mum and aunt when US marines stormed into their home and opened fire, killing everyone apart from Safa, on 19 November 2005. Her dad was also shot dead when he opened the front door.\n\nNow, 20 years on, a BBC Eye investigation has uncovered evidence that implicates two marines, who were never brought to trial, in the killing of Safa's family, according to a forensic expert.\n\nThe evidence - mainly statements and testimony given in the aftermath of the killings - raises doubts about the American investigation into what happened that day, and poses significant questions over how US armed forces are held to account.\n\nThe killing of Safa's family was part of what became known as the Haditha massacre, when US marines killed 24 Iraqi civilians, including four women and six children. They entered three homes killing nearly everyone inside, as well as a driver and four students in a car, who were on their way to college.\n\nThe incident triggered the longest US war crimes investigation of the Iraq war, but no-one was convicted of the killings.\n\nThe marines said they were responding to gunfire after a roadside bomb went off, killing one of their squad members, and injuring two others.\n\nBut Safa, who was 13 at the time, tells the World Service: \"We hadn't been accused of anything. We didn't even have any weapons in the house.\"\n\nShe survived by pretending to be dead among the small bodies of her sisters and brother - the youngest was three years old. \"I was the only survivor out of my entire family,\" she says.\n\nFour marines were initially charged with murder, but they gave conflicting accounts of the events, and over time US military prosecutors dropped charges against three of them, granting them immunity from further legal action.\n\nThat left squad leader Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich as the only one to face trial in 2012.\n\nIn a video recording of a pre-trial hearing, which has never been broadcast before, the most junior member of the squad, Lance Corporal Humberto Mendoza is questioned and re-enacts events at Safa's house.\n\nMendoza - who was a private at the time and was never charged - admits to killing Safa's father when he opened the front door to the marines.\n\n\"Did you see his hands?\" a lawyer asks him. \"Yes sir,\" Mendoza responds, and goes on to confirm that Safa's father was not armed. \"But you shot him anyways?\" the lawyer asks. \"Yes sir,\" Mendoza says.\n\nIn his official statements, Mendoza had initially claimed that after entering the house, he opened the door to the bedroom where Safa and her family were, but when he saw there were only women and children inside he did not go in, and instead shut the door.\n\nHowever, in a newly discovered audio recording from Wuterich's trial, Mendoza gives a different account. He says that he walked about 8ft (2.4m) into the bedroom.\n\nThis is hugely significant, according to forensic expert Michael Maloney. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service sent him to Haditha in 2006 to investigate the killings and he examined the bedroom where Safa's family was shot.\n\nUsing the crime scene photos taken by the Marine Corps at the time of the killings, he concluded that two marines had entered the room and shot the women and children.\n\nWhen we played him the recording of Mendoza saying he had walked into the room, Maloney said: \"This is just amazing to me, what we're listening to, and I've never heard this before today.\"\n\nHe said it showed Mendoza was placing himself in the position where Maloney concluded the first shooter stood, at the foot of the bed.\n\n\"If you were to ask me: 'Is this a confession of sorts?' What I'd say is: 'Mendoza confessed to everything except for pulling the trigger.'\"\n\nSafa had given a video deposition to military prosecutors in 2006 but it was never shown in court. In it, she described how the marine who opened the bedroom door threw in a grenade, which failed to explode, and then the same man came into the room and shot her family. Mendoza is the only marine who ever said he opened the door.\n\nAnother marine, Lance Corporal Stephen Tatum did not deny he took part in the shootings, but said he had followed the squad leader, Wuterich, into the bedroom and initially claimed he did not know there were women and children there because of poor visibility.\n\nBut in three later statements obtained by the BBC, Tatum gave a different account.\n\n\"I saw that children were in the room kneeling down. I don't remember the exact number but only that it was a lot. I am trained to shoot two shots to the chest and two shots to the head and I followed my training,\" Tatum told the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in April 2006.\n\nA month later, he said he \"was able to positively identify the people in the room as women and children before shooting them\".\n\nAnd then a week after that, he said: \"This is where I saw the kid I shot. Knowing it was a kid, I still shot him.\" He described the child as wearing a white T-shirt, standing on the bed, and having short hair.\n\nTatum's defence lawyers claimed these later statements had been obtained under duress. Charges against Tatum were dropped in March 2008, and the statements were disregarded at Wuterich's trial.\n\nForensics expert Michael Maloney said the statements by Mendoza and Tatum point to them being the two marines who shot Safa's family. He believes Mendoza went into the bedroom first and Tatum followed \"firing across the head of the bed\".\n\nWe put the allegations to Mendoza and Tatum. Mendoza did not respond. He has previously admitted to shooting Safa's father, but said he was following orders. He was never charged with a criminal offence.\n\nThrough his lawyer, Tatum said he wants to put Haditha behind him. He has never withdrawn his testimony that he was one of the shooters in Safa's house.\n\nMaloney told the BBC that the prosecution \"wanted Wuterich to be that primary shooter\". But before Maloney was able to testify, Wuterich's trial ended in a plea deal.\n\nWuterich maintained he could not remember what had happened in Safa's house, and agreed to plead guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty - a charge unrelated to any direct involvement in the killings.\n\nWuterich's military lawyer, Haytham Faraj, a former marine himself, said the punishment was \"tantamount to a slap on the wrist… like a speeding ticket\".\n\nNeal Puckett, the lead defence lawyer for Wuterich, said the whole investigation and prosecution against his client was \"botched\".\n\n\"The prosecution, in granting immunity to all their witnesses and dismissing all their charges… essentially rendered themselves incapable of achieving justice in this case,\" he said.\n\nHaytham Faraj agreed the process was deeply flawed.\n\n\"The government paid people to come in and lie, and the payment was immunity, and that's how they misused the legal process,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"The trial of Haditha was never meant to give voice to the victims,\" he added.\n\nHe said that survivors' \"impressions of a show trial with no real outcome, with no-one being punished, was right\".\n\nThe US Marine Corps told us it is committed to fair and open proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, ensuring due process of law. It added that it would not reopen the investigation unless a wealth of new, unexamined, and admissible evidence was introduced.\n\nThe lead prosecutor in the case did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nNow aged 33, Safa still lives in Haditha and has three children of her own. She says she can't understand how no marine was punished for her family's deaths.\n\nWhen we show her the video of Mendoza, she says he \"should have been imprisoned from the moment the incident happened, it should have been impossible for him to see the light of day\".\n\n\"It's as if it happened last year. I still think about it,\" she says of the day her family was killed.\n\n\"I want those who did this to be held accountable and to be punished by the law. It's been almost 20 years without them being tried. That's the real crime.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Namak Khoshnaw and Michael Epstein"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk0nd1nq6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:16:05.158+00:00","title":"Red Fort explosion: Man arrested over deadly Delhi car bomb blast","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man from Indian-administered Kashmir has been arrested in connection with a deadly car bomb attack in Delhi that killed eight people and wounded 20 others.

Republicans to vote to release the Epstein files, in a reversal from his previous position.\n\n\"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday night.\n\nThe shift from days of Trump fighting the proposal comes as the House is expected to hold a vote this week on legislation that would force the Justice Department to release the files to the public.\n\nSupporters of the proposal appear to have enough votes to pass the House, though it is unclear whether it would pass the Senate.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have been pushing a measure that would force the US justice department to make public more documents from the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nThe major shift in Trump's position comes as potentially dozens of Republicans were willing to break ranks in the vote.\n\nRepublican Representative Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in an interview with ABC News on Sunday that as many as  100 Republicans could vote in favour .\n\nKnown as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump posted the statement shortly after landing at Joint Base Andrews following a weekend in Florida.\n\n\"The Department of Justice has already turned over tens of thousands of pages to the Public on \"Epstein,\" are looking at various Democrat operatives (Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, Larry Summers, etc.) and their relationship to Epstein, and the House Oversight Committee can have whatever they are legally entitled to, I DON'T CARE!,\" Trump wrote, adding that he wanted Republicans to get \"BACK ON POINT\".\n\nTrump's reference to Clinton comes after the US justice department confirmed it will investigate paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein's alleged links to major banks and several prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton.\n\nTrump said he would ask Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to look into Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others.\n\nClinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.\n\nA spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regrets \"any association\" they had with Epstein, and added that the firm \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".\n\nLast week, thousands of Epstein's emails were released by the US Congress - with the files including mentions of the US president.

documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSome of the documents mention Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles; US President Donald Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment, who highlight the extent of Epstein's contact book.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in about 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nHere are some of the the other names that came up, which does not indicate wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.\n\nMichael Wolff, 72, is an American journalist and columnist - as well as a prolific author of books on the wealthy and the famous.\n\nFire and Fury, the first of several books spanning Trump's first stint as US president, came out in 2018, with descriptions of a dysfunctional White House and salacious details about the US commander-in-chief. Trump said it was \"full of lies\".\n\nThe new batch of files related to Jeffrey Epstein shed light on a relationship that appears to indicate a correspondence between Wolff and the late convicted sex offender.\n\nAttention has focused particularly on one of the emails, in which Wolff appears to give Epstein advice in relation to Trump, as Trump was campaigning for the White House for the first time.\n\nWolff wrote to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN was planning to ask Trump, as a presidential candidate, about his relationship with Epstein.\n\nEpstein replied: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"\n\nThe two go on to discuss a strategy, with Wolff writing: \"I think you should let him hang himself.\"\n\nIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.\n\nResponding to the release in a video posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.\n\nIn fact, Wolff disclosed before the latest presidential election in the US that he had interviewed Epstein \"periodically\" for Fire and Fury - and released tapes of those conversations.\n\nThe documents include correspondences between Epstein and Larry Summers, who was former Democratic President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary. It had been previously reported that the two men knew each other.\n\nThe emails indicate the two met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"presidnt [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".\n\nIn a separate email from late November 2016, just after Trump's election, Summers asked Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".\n\nDue to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin proximity\" and a \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".\n\nA spokesperson for Summers declined to comment, but referred the BBC to past statements by Summers. A representative told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 that the former official \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\".\n\nThe House of Representatives Oversight Committee released several email exchanges between Epstein and Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer who served as White House counsel during the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nIn August 2018, Ms Ruemmler and Epstein discussed hush-money payments made by Trump to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election - an issue over which Trump was later convicted of falsifying business records. Trump denies allegations that he had an affair with Daniels.\n\nThe exchange between Ms Ruemmler and Epstein culminated with Epstein writing: \"You see, I know how dirty donald is.\"\n\nThe bank Goldman Sachs, where Ms Ruemmler is currently chief legal officer and general counsel, told CNBC it was standing by its employee.\n\n\"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs. Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Goldman spokesperson Tony Fratto said in a statement to  CNBC.\n\nIn 2023, Ms Ruemmler  told the Wall Street Journal,  \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\nThe BBC has asked Ms Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs for further comment.\n\nThe name of billionaire investor and on-off Trump supporter Peter Thiel appeared again in the latest Epstein documents - having first been mentioned in a batch made public in September.\n\nAccording to the newly-released files, Epstein wrote to Mr Thiel in November 2018 to invite him to visit him in his Caribbean island, where some of Epstein's crimes are thought to have been committed.\n\nThe BBC has asked the Thiel Foundation and the investor's Founders Fund for comment. A representative for Mr Thiel told Politico that he had never visited the island.\n\nMr Thiel was critical of Epstein on an August 2024 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\n\n\"You know, I met Epstein a few times as well,\" Thiel said.\n\nMr Thiel said he was introduced to Epstein by another Silicon Valley executive in 2014.\n\n\"I didn't check, didn't ask any - enough questions about it,\" Mr Thiel said. He surmised that \"Epstein knew a lot about taxes\".\n\nThe latest document drop includes more correspondence between the famed linguist Noam Chomsky, 96, and Epstein. Many of their discussions were academic or personal.\n\nOccasionally the conversations turned to the subject of Trump, including in December 2016.\n\nIn his email, Mr Chomsky tells Epstein: \"I notice your prediction was right about Trump avoiding the White House as far too primitive.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted a representative of Mr Chomsky for comment.\n\nIn responses to previous reporting by the Wall Street Journal on their relationship, Mr Chomsky said Epstein had helped him move money between his accounts without \"one penny from Epstein\", and to acknowledge that \"I knew him and we met occasionally\".\n\nEpstein consulted publicist Peggy Siegal as the scandal around him and his associates unfolded.\n\nEpstein wrote to Ms Siegal in 2011 asking her to contact the founder of the Huffington Post, Ariana Huffington, in order to discredit the story of Virginia Giuffre, who was a prominent accuser of Epstein and Andrew. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.\n\nEpstein told Siegal that Huffington \"should champion the dangers of false allegations...\".\n\nThe email exchange shows Ms Siegal telling Epstein: \"If you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Ariana Huffington from me…\".\n\nIn a phone interview, Ms Siegal told the BBC she had never passed Epstein's request to Huffington. \"I did not call Ariana,\" she said. Huffington \"used to publish my writing and there's no reason in the world I would jeopardise that relationship,\" Ms Siegal added.\n\nBut the fact that Epstein had asked was \"not unusual.

2025-11-17T01:10:54.693+00:00\n\nTitle: Brazil's Amazon rainforest at risk as key protection under threat\n\nThe Amazon rainforest could face a renewed surge of deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a long-standing ban that has protected it.\n\nThe ban - which prohibits the sale of soya grown on land cleared after 2008 - is widely credited with curbing deforestation and has been held up as a global environmental success story.\n\nBut powerful farming interests in Brazil, backed by a group of Brazilian politicians, are pushing to lift the restrictions as the COP30 UN climate conference enters its second week.\n\nCritics of the ban say it is an unfair \"cartel\" which allows a small group of powerful companies to dominate the Amazon's soya trade.\n\nEnvironmental groups have warned removing the ban would be \"disaster\", opening the way for a new wave of land grabbing to plant more soya in the world's largest rainforest.\n\nScientists say ongoing deforestation, combined with the effects of climate change, is already driving the Amazon towards a potential \"tipping point\" – a threshold beyond which the rainforest can no longer sustain itself.\n\nBrazil is the world's largest producer of soya beans, a staple crop grown for its protein and an important animal feed.\n\nMuch of the meat consumed in the UK – including chicken, beef, pork and farmed fish - is raised using feeds that include soya beans, about 10% of which are sourced from the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nMany major UK food companies, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, M&S, Aldi, Lidl, McDonald's, Greggs and KFC, are members of a coalition called  the UK Soy Manifesto  which represents around 60% of the soy imported into the UK.\n\nThe group supports the ban, which is known officially as the Amazon Soy Moratorium, because they argue it helps ensure UK soy supply chains remain free from deforestation.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year  the signatories said: \"We urge all actors within the soy supply chain, including governments, financial institutions and agribusinesses to reinforce their commitment to the [ban] and ensure its continuation.\"\n\nPublic opinion in the UK also appears to be firmly behind protecting the Amazon.  A World Wildlife Fund survey  conducted earlier this year found that 70% of respondents supported government action to eliminate illegal deforestation from UK supply chains.\n\nBut Brazilian opponents of the agreement last week  demanded the Supreme Court - the highest court in the country – reopen an investigation  into whether the moratorium amounts to anti-competitive behaviour.\n\n\"Our state has lots of room to grow and the soy moratorium is working against this development,\" Vanderlei Ataídes told the BBC.  He is president of the Soya Farmers Association of Pará state, one of Brazil's main soya producing areas.\n\n\"I don't understand how [the ban] helps the environment,\" he added.  \"I can't plant soya beans, but I can use the same land to plant corn, rice, cotton or other crops.  Why can't I plant soya?\"\n\nThe challenge has even divided the Brazilian government. While the Justice Ministry says there may be evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, both the Ministry of the Environment and the Federal Public Prosecutors Office have publicly defended the moratorium.\n\nThe voluntary agreement was first signed almost two decades ago by farmers, environmental organisations and major global food companies, including commodities giants such as Cargill and Bunge.\n\nIt followed a campaign by the environmental pressure group Greenpeace that exposed how soya grown on deforested land was being used in animal feed, including for chicken sold by McDonald's.\n\nThe fast-food chain became a champion of the moratorium, whose signatories pledged not to buy soya grown on land deforested after 2008.\n\nBefore the moratorium, forest clearance for soya expansion and the growth of cattle ranching were the main drivers of Amazonian deforestation.\n\nAfter the agreement was introduced forest clearance fell sharply, reaching an historic low in 2012 during President Lula's second term in office.\n\nDeforestation increased under subsequent administrations – notably under Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted opening the forest to economic development - but has fallen again during Lula's current presidency.\n\nBel Lyon, chief advisor for Latin America at the World Wildlife Fund - one of the agreement's original signatories – warned that suspending the moratorium \"would be a disaster for the Amazon, its people, and the world, because it could open up an area the size of Portugal to deforestation\".\n\nSmall farmers whose plots are close to soy plantations say they disrupt local weather patterns and make it harder to grow their crops.\n\nRaimundo Barbosa, who farms cassava and fruit near the town of Boa Esperança outside Santarém in the southeastern Amazon, says when the forest is cleared \"the environment is destroyed\".\n\n\"Where there is forest, it is normal, but when it is gone it just gets hotter and hotter and there is less rain and less water in the rivers,\" he told me as we sat in the shade beside the machines he uses to turn his cassava into flour.\n\nThe pressure to lift the moratorium comes as Brazil prepares to open a major new railway stretching from its agricultural heartland in the south up into the rainforest.\n\nThe railway is expected to significantly cut transport costs for soya and other agricultural products, adding yet another incentive to clear more land.\n\nScientists say deforestation is already reshaping the rainforest in profound ways. Among them is Amazon specialist Bruce Fosberg, who has spent half a century studying the forest.\n\nHe climbs 15 stories up a narrow tower that rises 45 metres above a pristine rainforest reserve in the heart of the Amazon. From a small platform at the top, he looks out over a sea of green stretching to the horizon.\n\nThe tower is bristling with high-tech instruments - sensors that track almost everything happening between the forest and the atmosphere: water vapor, carbon dioxide, sunlight, and essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.\n\nThe tower was built 27 years ago and is part of a project - the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) - that aims to understand how the Amazon is changing, and how close it is to a critical threshold.\n\nData from the LBA together with other scientific studies show parts of the rainforest may be nearing a \"tipping point\", after which the ecosystem can no longer maintain its own functions.\n\n\"The living forest is closing down,\" he says, \"and not producing water vapour and therefore rainfall\".\n\nAs trees are lost to deforestation, fire, and heat stress, the forest releases less moisture into the atmosphere, he explains, reducing rainfall and intensifying drought. That, in turn, creates a feedback loop that kills even more trees.\n\nThe fear is that, if this continues, vast areas of rainforest could die away and become a savannah or dry grassland ecosystem.\n\nSuch a collapse would release huge amounts of carbon, disrupt weather patterns across continents, and threaten the millions of people – as well as the countless plant, insect and animal species – whose lives depend on the Amazon for survival.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter  to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

of a churning, brown river in Belém, Brazil, machines are pulping candidates for the next global \"superfood\".\n\nCupuaçu... Taperebá... Bacaba... Like açaí berries - these fruits are rich in antioxidants, fibre or fatty acids.\n\nIf Brazil has its way, they could soon be popping up on your social media feeds and being sold in fashionable cafes in the UK, Europe and the US.\n\nIt's part of a bold plan by the country, which is hosting the COP30 UN climate talks, to tackle climate change, protect nature and create wealth in the face of considerable regional poverty.\n\n\"There's a lot of superfoods in the forest that people don't know,\" says Max Petrucci, founder of a local company Mahta that sells powdered cacao and Brazil nuts for shakes.\n\nThe drink he gives me to try is gritty and tastes like chocolate without sugar.\n\n\"We're focussed first on nutrition and the health benefits that these Amazonian ingredients provide,\" he explains.\n\nBut the second benefit, he explains, is \"social and environmental\". He says they pay fair prices and only buy from farmers who practice sustainable farming.\n\nIt sounds like a marketing pitch and the company's slick packaging promises \"ancestral ingredients\" and the \"power of purple fruits from the forest\".\n\nScientific research into the benefits of \"superfoods\" is limited, but  eating Amazonian fruits is generally recognised to be good for you.\n\nLarissa Bueno, also at Mahta, explains that they only sell powdered foods - \"similar to Huel in the UK,\" she says.\n\nTransporting raw fruits that degrade within days of picking is expensive. But if companies freeze dry ingredients into powders to sell to supermarkets or ship abroad, \"it keeps more of the nutritional value and it's a smart way to keep more economic value in Brazil\", she explains.\n\nThe lab in Belém's Bioeconomy Park is helping small companies test new ways of preserving fruits.\n\n\"People have been eating from these forests for more than 10,000 years. There are many, many, many undiscovered superfoods, \" Max says.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest, which covers 6 million sq km (2.3 million sq miles), has always been full of natural wealth. But for decades its vast ecosystem has been decaying, with areas chopped down to sell timber or clear space for cattle or crops like soy.\n\nThis damaged one of the earth's great protections against climate change - trees that soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide.\n\nUnusually,  more than two-thirds of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions come from land use and agriculture , rather than energy like most countries. Those emissions mainly stem from cutting down forest or growing vast amounts of food.\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to halve deforestation by 2030. In the 12 months to July 2025, rates reached an 11-year low.\n\nBut the forest is a resource. The nearly 30 million people living in the Amazon region, and across Brazil, need and want to make a living.\n\nBrazil is pushing the idea of building a prospering economy by sustainably using natural resources, preserving nature to protect the vitality of the land, and developing valuable products including fuels, pharmaceuticals, and foods.\n\nBuilding this \"bio-economy\" features strongly in its national climate action plan.\n\nSarah Sampaio runs a small coffee company that grows coffee beans in the shadow of trees, using a method called agroforesty - or agriculture that helps cultivate forests.\n\nShe works with around 200 farming families in the Apui region, which has one of the highest rates of deforestation.\n\n\"We plant native Amazonian trees and the coffee together. The trees shade the coffee plants and farmers can also grow their own food around those plants,\" she says.\n\n\"When the coffee plant dies, the trees remain as the forest, so it's helping to restore the Amazon.\"\n\nThe fresh brew I'm given has a light, fruity taste, and she's proud that three of her coffees were selected among the 30 best in Brazil in the national Coffee of the Year competition.\n\n\"If we want to stop more trees from being chopped down, we have to provide people with an alternative income, a sustainable way of living,\" Sarah says.\n\nWhatever the next Amazonian superfood is, it will need to challenge açaí. The purple berry is grown and eaten in huge quantities in northern Brazil and sold for nearly £10 ($13) per smoothie bowl in parts of London.\n\nDamien Benoit sells açaí ice cream in Europe. \"It's very high in antioxidants, in fibres and unsaturated fatty acids, and in different minerals that make it very popular among people who do sports,\" he says.\n\nHe works with families who keeps four hectares of açai plants in the forest \"with a minimum number of species per hectare that must be monitored.\"\n\n\"We make sure children go to school, and gender equality is a huge topic for us,\" he claims.\n\nOn their own, these small companies cannot feed millions of people and, so far, they've prospered due to grants or capital from charities and funds that invest in companies aimed at protecting nature.\n\nAnd there are questions around how much they can be scaled up.\n\nIf açaí production was expanded into many industrial-size plantations, it could start to cause exactly the same problems that people like Damien are trying to solve.\n\nBut there's a reason the word \"bioeconomy\" is plastered all over the UN climate talks.\n\n\"We need to move from a world dependent on fossil fuels - that is clear,\" says Ana Yang, Director of the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House.\n\n\"And if we don't have solutions that are bio-based, we will not be able to do that,\" she says.\n\nThis is by no means a magic bullet solution to the problem of how to replace fossil fuels with clean energy and use the land in a way that protects nature.\n\nBrazil has also promised a four-fold increase in the use of biofuels, which can be controversial, by 2035. Biofuels such as ethanol are often touted as a replacement for fossil fuels, but they can lead to deforestation as demand increases for the crop to burn to make the fuel.\n\nSome are concerned this will lead to the unsustainable extraction of timber or sugarcane to export abroad and burn, and the theft of indigenous peoples' land.\n\nMs Yang says it's essential to put safeguards like strong regulation in place.\n\n\"Not all bio-based transitions are good,\" she says.\n\n\"If they lead to destruction of natural habitat or they don't have good social practices, then it isn't solving the original problem.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891zkwvjl2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"02:59:09.977+00:00","title":"Ecuador votes against allowing foreign military bases in country","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ecuadorians have voted against allowing foreign military bases, including a U.S. presence, reversing a 2008 constitutional ban that previously prohibited such operations.

country\n\nEcuadoreans have voted against allowing the return of foreign military bases in the country, frustrating US hopes of expanding its presence in the Eastern Pacific region.\n\nThe referendum result is a blow to Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, who had campaigned to change the constitution in order to reverse a ban that the country's legislature passed in 2008.\n\nHe said it would help fight organised crime and reduce the soaring violence the country has seen in recent years, during which it has become one of the world's biggest drug-trafficking hotspots.\n\nThe US had hoped the referendum would pave the way for it to open a military base, 16 years after it was made to close a site on the Pacific coast.\n\nWhile Ecuador does not produce cocaine, its huge ports and proximity to Colombia and Peru - where large quantities of the drug are made - make it a desirable and lucrative location for drug-trafficking gangs.\n\nAccording to Noboa, about 70% of the world's cocaine passes through Ecuador.\n\nHis presidency has been defined by a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs, including by putting armed soldiers on the streets.\n\nSupporters say his approach has helped to fight crime, but critics say his government has resorted to authoritarian tactics.\n\nThe US's former military base on Ecuador's Pacific coast was closed after left-wing president Rafael Correa decided not to renew its lease and pushed for a constitutional ban which was passed by lawmakers.\n\nUS Homeland Secretary Secretary Kristi Noem recently toured military facilities in Ecuador with Noboa.\n\nIn a BBC interview earlier this year, Noboa said he wanted foreign \"armies\" to join what he has described as a \"war\" against narco-trafficking groups. He has recently held talks over increased regional security and migration co-operation with US officials.\n\nThe referendum also saw voters reject ending public funding for political parties, shrinking the size of Congress, and establishing a constitutional assembly to re-write the Ecuador's constitution.\n\nNoboa had argued a fresh constitution could allow for tougher punishments for criminals and stronger measures to secure the borders, but critics argued it would not solve wider social problems like insecurity and poor access to education or healthcare in some areas.\n\nCritics also feared the plans to reduce funding for political parties and the size of Congress could lead to a reduction in checks and balances on the government and representation in poorer areas, though the government hoped it would save public funds.\n\nNoboa reacted by saying he would \"respect\" the outcome of the vote.\n\nOn the day of the referendum, the leader of one of Ecuador's biggest drug-trafficking gangs, Los Lobos, was captured in an operation involving Spanish police.\n\nAccording to Noboa, Wilmer \"Pipo\" Chavarria had faked his own death and had been hiding in Europe while controlling criminal operations like drug-trafficking, ordering murders and illegal mining in Ecuador.\n\nBoth Ecuador and the US have designated Los Lobos as a terrorist organisation under domestic law.\n\nThis referendum played came as the US sent its largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades, including the world's largest warship and bomber planes.\n\nIt has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean, killing at least 83 people. It has not provided evidence about who is on board and some lawyers have said the strikes could breach international law.\n\nSpeculation is mounting over whether the US will strike land targets in Venezuela.\n\nThe US alleges that its President Nicolás Maduro is the head of a narco-trafficking organisation, an accusation he strongly denies.\n\nMany observers believe the US military build-up in the region is also an attempt to put pressure on Maduro to force him from power."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jd0v8dvpwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"00:58:14.216+00:00","title":"Communist and far-right candidates head to Chile presidential run-off","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chile's presidential election, following a first-round deadlock, will proceed to a run-off vote on December 14, 2025, between Communist Party candidate Jeannette Jara and far-right candidate José Antonio Kast.

The Times also spoke with more than 65 officials who have worked in the federal government during the current Trump administration, in addition to local authorities and others who collaborate with the department. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters and out of fear of retribution.\n\nThe overhaul represents a striking departure for the behemoth agency that Congress created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Department was tasked with preventing terrorism, protecting the president, investigating transnational crime and responding to natural disasters, among other duties. Immigration enforcement was one of many responsibilities, but it was not envisioned as D.H.S.’s singular function.\n\nToday, the Trump administration has remade the agency into a veritable Department of Deportation.\n\nThe shift has had consequences.\n\nHomeland security investigators worked approximately 33 percent fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February through April compared to their average in prior years, according to a Times analysis of data obtained through the F.O.I.A. lawsuit.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking,” said Hany Farid, a computer scientist who helped create software used by law enforcement and technology companies to detect child sexual abuse material. “You can’t say you care about kids when you’re diverting actual resources that are protecting children.”\n\nAdministration officials defended Mr. Trump’s approach, saying the immigration crackdown was paramount to protecting public safety and national security. They also disputed that the intensified focus on immigration had undermined D.H.S.’s work.\n\n“Child exploitation, human trafficking, terrorism, financial scams and smuggling all have a nexus to illegal immigration,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement. “D.H.S. is mobilizing federal and state law enforcement to find, arrest and deport illegal aliens. We are prioritizing the worst of the worst and aliens with final removal orders. Nearly every day we are arresting pedophiles, known or suspected terrorists, kidnappers, child smugglers and sex traffickers, including those who entered our country illegally.”\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said that “any insinuation that the Trump administration isn’t successfully combating dangerous crime is false and uninformed.”\n\nIn fact, federal data shows that many immigrants being arrested do not have criminal records in the United States. Fewer than 40 percent of people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement — the D.H.S. law enforcement agency leading the administration’s crackdown — have a criminal conviction, according to a Times analysis. Roughly 8 percent of those arrested had been convicted of a violent crime, while about 9 percent had a traffic conviction, the analysis found.\n\nThe pressure to deport more people began almost as soon as Mr. Trump took office.\n\nStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of Mr. Trump’s deportation agenda, holds a regular morning conference call with top government officials to plan and execute the massive operation, according to officials briefed on the sessions and a calendar invitation viewed by The Times.\n\nMr. Miller, who comes to the 30-minute calls deeply versed in deportation and arrest data, has at times berated ICE leaders for not arresting enough people, the officials said. And his questions and directives regularly ripple out across the vast D.H.S. bureaucracy.\n\nAgency policy experts who specialize in other issues have been told to analyze immigration data to prepare for and respond to the calls. Special agents at Homeland Security Investigations — which is D.H.S.’s criminal investigations arm and a part of ICE — have been abruptly issued new orders.\n\nThe H.S.I. reassignments have occurred in rotations with thousands of agents being redirected to immigration duties for stints ranging from days to months, according to two officials. H.S.I. has about 7,000 agents in total, who normally investigate transnational criminal organizations and other high-level lawbreakers.\n\nTheir new duties have included compiling addresses of undocumented immigrants, producing reports on student protesters, driving detainees to lockups and making arrests at traffic stops, big-box store parking lots and immigration courts.\n\nEven highly trained specialists have been pulled into immigration work, such as analysts who assist in money laundering and counterterrorism cases and agents who investigate the multibillion-dollar black market for looted antiquities, a source of income for organized crime and terrorist groups.\n\nOther top officials have also felt pressure. In late May, as deportation numbers lagged well below Mr. Trump’s goals, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, joined by Mr. Miller, tried to turbocharge the effort with a warning at the department’s headquarters. Speaking to ICE officials who run the agency’s field offices and had traveled to Washington, Ms. Noem promised that no job at the department would be safe, including her own, if deportations did not pick up, according to people with knowledge of her remarks.\n\nSince then, the number of people in immigration detention has soared past 60,000, a record tally. The Homeland Security Department says it has deported more than 550,000 people, with the daily pace of removals reaching levels not seen since the Obama administration. Illegal border crossings have fallen to their lowest point in decades.\n\nThe Republican policy bill enacted this summer made the administration’s priorities clear, with about $162 billion in new D.H.S. funding for border security and immigration enforcement, significantly shifting the department’s focus. More than half of the department’s annual budget is projected to fund immigration activities over the next few years, up from 37 percent during the last fiscal year, according to a Times analysis.\n\nICE’s budget is expected to nearly triple and its staff to grow by 66 percent, an investment that will make it the nation’s highest-funded law enforcement agency.\n\nAfter a funding boost, immigration programs now make up more than half of the D.H.S. budget, according to a New York Times analysis.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\nHow the new budget breaks down\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nFederal Emergency\n\nManagement Agency\n\n(includes disaster relief)\n\nU.S. Customs and\n\nBorder Protection\n\nU.S. Immigration and\n\nCustoms Enforcement\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\n$70 billion\n\n$41 billion\n\n$77 billion\n\n$81 billion\n\nHow the new budget breaks down\n\nNONIMMIGRATION\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n\n(includes disaster relief)\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\nU.S. Coast Guard\n\nTransportation\n\nAdministration\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nNotes: Figures are rounded.

Source: New York Times analysis of D.H.S. budget data.\n\nAlicia Parlapiano/The New York Times\n\nThere are no indications the White House pressure will relent.\n\nOn his conference call, Mr. Miller has recently pushed ICE leaders to arrest even more people, pointing to the ongoing hiring spree that will see the agency bring on more than 14,000 new employees, according to the people familiar with his comments.\n\nThe immigration operation has also pulled in thousands of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Drug Enforcement Administration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; and at least four other federal law enforcement agencies, documents show. In addition, agents from D.H.S. and many of those other agencies have been diverted to Mr. Trump’s anti-crime crackdown in Washington, which has functioned as a shadow immigration operation.\n\nEvery incoming administration prioritizes its own policy goals, and homeland security officials often describe a sense of whiplash when a new president takes power. Under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., some agents were pulled off investigations and sent to help process migrants coming over the southern border.\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s overhaul surpasses previous efforts, according to current and former officials.\n\n“D.H.S. keeps being pulled further away from its core missions in protecting the homeland,” said David Lapan, who served as the department’s press secretary during the first Trump administration. “These distractions could have deadly consequences.”\n\nAllies of Mr. Trump including Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II — an acting deputy secretary of homeland security in Mr. Trump’s first term — said such changes were long overdue.\n\nAs one of the authors of Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, Mr. Cuccinelli had conceived of dismantling D.H.S. and setting up a separate agency for immigration enforcement because, he wrote, the department as designed by Congress was too “disjointed.”\n\nBut rather than wait for Congress to enact changes, Mr. Trump has been essentially acting on his own.\n\n“President Trump is effectively changing the permanent course of D.H.S.,” Mr. Cuccinelli told The Times.\n\nHere are six aspects of the Homeland Security Department’s mission that have been acutely disrupted by the immigration crackdown:\n\nEarlier this year, special agents at Homeland Security Investigations found online videos showing violent sexual abuse of an unidentified young child.\n\nTrained to hunt down pedophiles who use the internet to distribute illegal imagery, the H.S.I. agents spent weeks analyzing the footage to try to identify the child and infiltrate the online networks that had shared and may have directed the abuse, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.\n\nBut the agents working the case have since been asked to go out in the field and help arrest undocumented immigrants. The reassignment has hindered progress toward identifying and rescuing the child, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive investigation. The person said that the agents, no longer able to spend as much time undercover online, had lost contact with a key source they had cultivated over years in the online world of abusers.\n\nThe disruption of that case reflects a broader pattern, The Times investigation found.\n\nH.S.I. teams that investigate sex crimes against children in cities including Newark and Los Angeles have had significant numbers of special agents dragooned into immigration work, according to people with knowledge of the changes. At one point, an entire unit of roughly five people investigating child exploitation in Los Angeles was working immigration duty, with agents trying to advance their cases on nights and weekends, one of those people said.\n\nFrom February through April of this year, H.S.I. agents nationwide worked the fewest hours on child exploitation that they have during that period in more than a decade, according to The Times’s data analysis.\n\nDuring that same period, H.S.I. agents spent at least five times as many hours working immigration cases as they did on average during Mr. Trump’s first term. More recent data was not available because of the government shutdown.\n\nThe number of hours agents spent on child exploitation cases likely decreased even further over the summer and fall, as D.H.S. increased its focus on immigration enforcement during that period, according to people interviewed by The Times. The data also suggested a likely drop in the number of arrests and child victims identified, but appeared too provisional to support a reliable estimate.\n\nMs. McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokeswoman, said that under the Trump administration “law enforcement has continued to rescue children from sex offenders and traffickers.” She added that H.S.I. is “not slowing down and remains committed to all aspects of its mission, leveraging a whole-of-government approach to address threats to public safety and national security.”\n\nA shift has been noticed at some of Silicon Valley’s largest tech companies, which report tens of millions of photographs and videos showing suspected child abuse each year to the authorities.\n\nEngineers who work on child safety issues at Google, Meta, Microsoft and other companies told The Times that there had been a noticeable drop in follow-up from federal officials regarding the materials they had flagged. Some of them had heard from law enforcement contacts that resources were being shifted to immigration cases.\n\nMicrosoft and Meta declined to comment. Google did not respond to questions.\n\nFor nearly a decade, a team of roughly two dozen special agents from H.S.I. and F.B.I. offices in Washington, New York, Minneapolis and other cities have investigated Iran’s efforts to evade international sanctions and sell oil on the black market. The cases often involve chasing a so-called ghost fleet of tankers carrying that oil to foreign ports.\n\nIran uses the profits to fund its military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which the United States has designated a terrorist entity, as well as Hamas and the Houthi government in Yemen, federal authorities have said.\n\nBut since the immigration crackdown, cases where officials worked to seize tankers loaded with Iranian oil and bank accounts where profits are stored have languished for months, with agents too busy on immigration duty to interview sources or draft seizure affidavits, according to roughly half a dozen people with knowledge of the effort. In the meantime, ships and cash have disappeared before they could be seized, and arrests have been delayed, some of those people said.\n\nA typical investigative task that normally takes a day “now takes two weeks,” one person said. Another said that “money and oil have gotten away.”\n\nD.H.S. did not respond to a question about the status of its agents working on the Iranian oil cases. Natalie Baldassarre, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which plays a leading role in the probes, said it was “acutely focused” on protecting national security and stopping criminals.\n\n“Assisting our partners with immigration enforcement has not deterred our ability to also successfully investigate and prosecute other types of crime,” Ms. Baldassare said.\n\nOne of D.H.S.’s major functions is distributing intelligence reports about terrorism, active shooter incidents and other threats across government, an attempt to fill the gap in information sharing exposed by the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nBut employees at D.H.S.’s intelligence office have been increasingly directed to focus more on supporting immigration enforcement than on other security issues, according to people familiar with its operations. That shift in emphasis has affected the daily intelligence briefings that go to top officials, according to these people.\n\nAnd local law enforcement authorities are now receiving far fewer intelligence reports than they normally would, according to people familiar with the reports. One official said the decline in information sharing has amounted to “chipping away at everything that’s been built since Sept. 11.”\n\nD.H.S. said that it had identified “redundant positions and noncritical programs” at the intelligence office and that it was returning the department “back to its core mission of prioritizing American safety and enforcing our laws.”\n\nThe federal government’s main law enforcement training academy has suspended many of its programs for nonimmigration agents for the rest of the year, aiming to make room for the thousands of new deportation officers being hired by ICE. That has delayed classes for new recruits and experienced officers from other agencies.\n\nAffected agencies include the Secret Service, the Army Criminal Investigative Division, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the Energy Department’s Office of Secure Transportation, which is responsible for safely moving nuclear weapons and components, according to seven people with knowledge of the delays.\n\n“We must focus our resources on surge-related training” for immigration enforcement, officials at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers wrote in a memo this summer. “As a result, training programs for agencies not directly involved in these efforts, originally scheduled between Sept. 9 and Dec. 31, 2025, will be rescheduled to later dates.”\n\nHeather J. Hagan, a U.S. Army spokeswoman, said that the Army’s law enforcement arm lost 111 classroom spots at the academy after “numerous advanced courses” were canceled.\n\nTwo special agents at the Diplomatic Security Service, which provides protection for diplomats and U.S. embassies, said disruptions at the federal training academy had delayed the on-boarding of new recruits, raising the possibility of staffing shortages overseas.\n\nD.H.S. said that the academy was “actively adjusting and rescheduling training schedules as needed.” Spokespeople for agencies that have had training schedules altered told The Times that their core missions and recruitment efforts had not been hindered.\n\nIn June, Coast Guard officials agreed to redeploy two C-27 planes from Clearwater, Fla., to Alexandria, La., where ICE maintains its busiest detention center, and another plane from Sacramento to Mesa, Ariz., according to documents reviewed by The Times and a person familiar with the arrangement. The planes are surveillance craft used in drug interdiction and other missions.\n\nSearch-and-rescue planes from Alaska and North Carolina were also put “on call,” the documents show.\n\nThe redeployment of the planes posed a “high risk to mission fail” for certain Coast Guard operations, one of the documents stated.\n\nThe Coast Guard also made plans to send dozens of staff members to support immigration enforcement. The initial cost, including the plane deployment, was estimated to be around $7 million, according to the documents.\n\nThis month, the search-and-rescue leader for a Coast Guard regional command center was told he had to report within days to Texas for a monthslong border deployment, leaving other staff members to cover for him, according to a person familiar with the situation and documents viewed by The Times.\n\nD.H.S. said that the Coast Guard had transported more than 7,300 immigrants so far this year. A Coast Guard spokesman said it “carefully balances all operations and mission requirements, including search and rescue, to ensure readiness is not compromised.”\n\nThe pressure to ramp up low-level immigration enforcement has had negative impacts on more complex human smuggling and sex and labor trafficking cases, according to federal officials.\n\nOne federal prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that such cases were stagnating as H.S.I. investigators were sidetracked with immigration roundups. Agents from H.S.I.’s Center for Countering Human Trafficking, which assists trafficking investigations, have been reassigned to Mr. Trump’s anti-crime crackdown in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement official.\n\nAnd one former law enforcement official who now works in the travel industry said that after he tried to report sex trafficking at hotels to H.S.I., he was told that agents might not be able to investigate urgently because of immigration duty.\n\nD.H.S. disputed that those investigations had been affected.\n\nHow The Times Analyzed D.H.S. Data\n\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, The New York Times obtained Department of Homeland Security statistical reports that indicate the monthly number of hours worked, arrests made, and search warrants executed by Homeland Security Investigations staff working on investigations into child exploitation, immigration, and other crimes.\n\nThe Times received two responses, one generated in April and the other in June, with monthly figures going back to to 2022 and 2007, respectively. The response created in June included some figures that were greater than those in the April report.\n\nAs a result, The Times took a cautious approach in quantifying trends. To estimate the hours worked during February, March and April, the first three full months of the administration, The Times took into account the percentage increase for a comparable period between the two reports. Because the revisions followed a less predictable pattern for arrests and victims, The Times decided against citing direct figures for those categories, although the provisional figures also showed declines.\n\nD.H.S. did not respond to questions seeking clarity on the data.\n\nReporting was contributed by John Ismay, Eric Schmitt, Sheera Frenkel, Alicia Parlapiano, Albert Sun, Eileen Sullivan, Jeff Adelson, Kate Conger, Alex Klavens, Maxine Joselow and Devlin Barrett.

CCTV videos from a maternity hospital in India have been sold on Telegram, police say, raising serious questions about privacy and security in a country where such cameras have become commonplace.\n\nEarlier this year, police in Gujarat state were alerted by the media to videos on YouTube - some showed pregnant women undergoing medical exams and receiving injections in their buttocks - in a maternity hospital in a city.\n\nThe videos had a link directing viewers to Telegram channels to buy longer videos.\n\nThe director of the hospital told the BBC that the cameras had been installed for the safety of doctors. The BBC is not naming the city or hospital to protect the identity of the women in the videos. None of them have filed a police complaint.\n\nPolice say their investigation uncovered a massive cybercrime racket where sensitive footage from at least 50,000 CCTVs from across the country was stolen by hackers and sold on the internet.\n\nCCTVs  have become ubiquitous in India , especially in urban areas. They are installed in malls, offices, hospitals, schools, private apartment complexes and even inside people's homes.\n\nExperts warn that while CCTV boosts security, poorly installed or managed systems can threaten privacy. In India, cameras are often handled by staff without cybersecurity training, and some domestically manufactured models are reportedly easily exploitable.\n\nIn 2018, a tech worker in Bengaluru city  said that his webcam was hacked , and that the hacker demanded payment in exchange for not sharing his private videos. In 2023, a YouTuber reportedly found out that  his home CCTV had been hacked  after private videos went viral.\n\nLast year, the federal government asked states to  not procure CCTVs from suppliers with a history of security and data breaches  and also introduced new rules to improve cyber security of CCTV cameras. But hacking incidents like these are still reported.\n\nIn Gujarat, police say they ended up discovering a \"network of individuals spread across the country\".\n\n\"[They] were hacking into the video surveillance systems - or CCTV systems - of hospitals, schools, colleges, corporate offices and even the bedrooms of private individuals in multiple states,\" Lavina Sinha, who heads the Ahmedabad cyber crime department investigating the case, told reporters.\n\nHardik Makadiya, Gujarat's top cybercrime official, says videos were sold for 800–2,000 rupees  ($9-22; £7-17, with Telegram channels offering live CCTV feeds via subscription.\n\nPolice have registered a case under various sections of the law, including violating a female patient's privacy, publishing obscene material, voyeurism and cyber terrorism - which is a non-bailable offence. They say that they reached out to Telegram and YouTube, and the videos have been taken down.\n\nSince February, police have arrested eight people in the case - four from Maharashtra and others from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, and Uttarakhand. They remain in judicial custody as the case proceeds in court.\n\nYash Koshti, lawyer for three of the accused, denied the allegations, saying they were not hackers or cyber criminals and that someone else carried out the breach.\n\nCybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia warns that weakly protected CCTV and home networks are easy targets and must be properly secured.\n\n\"Wireless CCTV systems help you access the footage remotely, like on your smartphone or laptop. But once a system is connected to the web, it's easy for hackers to decode its IP address and default password. And once they get into the system, they can see or record live footage, download it or even shut down the system,\" Mr Bhatia says.\n\nHe says that one way to secure surveillance systems is to change IP addresses and the default password.\n\nMr Bhatia advises using a robust password that mixes letters, numbers, and symbols and cannot be found in a dictionary, and recommends periodic audits by a cybersecurity professional.\n\nHe adds that CCTV manufacturers also bear responsibility, and their packaging should clearly warn users to replace default passwords with strong ones - similar to cigarette packet health warnings.\n\nMr Makadiya told the BBC that many of the hacked CCTVs used default passwords - like Admin123 - or weak ones.\n\n\"The hackers used brute force (the use of certain programmes to generate thousands of letter-number password combinations) to break into these systems and access videos,\" he said.\n\nAudrey Dmello of Majlis, a legal centre for women's and children's rights, highlights the ubiquity of CCTVs in India, often installed without consent. She urges organisations, especially in sensitive spaces, to ensure their systems are properly secured.\n\n\"Organisations and institutions that set up surveillance systems, especially in sensitive spaces, must see to it that their systems are adequately secured. It's an absolute must,\" she says.\n\nThe director of one of the affected hospitals told the BBC the CCTVs in exam and injection rooms were meant to protect doctors from false allegations. He added that the cameras have since been removed from sensitive areas.\n\nPolice in Gujarat told the BBC that neither the hospital nor any patient had come forward to file a formal complaint. The complaint was finally lodged by a police officer.\n\n\"Female patients fear that their identity will be revealed. Therefore, they are not willing to lodge a complaint,\" said an officer.\n\nMs Dmello says that the shame women face around such incidents only adds to its horrific nature.\n\n\"When there is a sexual angle involved, the victim is re-victimised because of the patriarchal nature of Indian society. If we want women to assert their rights and we want criminals to be brought to justice, we, as a society, should first stop shaming and blaming women for the crime,\" she says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4172yl0l1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"17:02:02.960+00:00","title":"Iran begins cloud seeding to induce rain during worst drought in decades","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is implementing cloud seeding operations across key regions, including the Urmia lake basin and parts of West and East Azerbaijan, in an urgent attempt to combat its worst drought in decades.

faces DHS crackdown as agents target 'criminal illegal aliens'\n\nFederal agents have descended on the city of Charlotte in North Carolina as part of US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said.\n\nFederal immigration authorities carried out nearly 100 arrests in the Charlotte area on Saturday, according to CBS, the BBC's American news partner.\n\nLocal officials, including Mayor of Charlotte Vi Lyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing \"unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community.\n\nSince Trump's return to office  he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago  to deliver on his promise of \"the largest deportation programme\" in US history.\n\nThe DHS announced \"Operation Charlotte's Web\" on Saturday, saying \"criminal illegal aliens\" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.\n\n\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.\n\nArmoured vehicles and special operations teams could be involved in the North Charlotte crackdown, according to internal government documents seen by the  BBC's US partner, CBS News.\n\nSeveral church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man,  The Charlotte Observer  reported, quoting the church's pastor.\n\n\"We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,\" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.\n\nOfficials said there are \"a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters\".\n\nThe DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to \"sanctuary policies\".\n\nCharlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place  to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities  - but it is a \"certified welcoming city\". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.\n\n\"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,\" the DHS said.\n\nCharlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to  Data US.\n\nDHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing.\n\nEarlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was \"extremely concerned\" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina.\n\nThe next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed to the city.\n\nOperations in previous cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have come under fire over concerns of excessive use of force."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/us/politics/national-guard-withdrawal-chicago-portland.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:11:04-05:00","title":"Pentagon to Withdraw Some National Guard Troops From Chicago and Portland","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon is withdrawing hundreds of National Guard troops from Chicago and Portland, primarily from Texas and California, after federal court orders and legal challenges blocked their operational deployment.

National Guard Troops From Chicago and Portland\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T10:11:04-05:00\n\nThe Pentagon is withdrawing hundreds of National Guard soldiers from Chicago and Portland, Ore., just weeks after President Trump ordered them there over the strenuous objections of state and local leaders, according to two U.S. officials.\n\nSome 200 California National Guard troops who were sent to Portland and another 200 Texas National Guard members who were sent to Chicago will return to their home states beginning as early as Sunday, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deployments.\n\nThe federalized Guard troops arrived in those cities in early October but never deployed into the streets to assist federal law enforcement personnel and protect federal buildings, as the Trump administration envisioned, because of legal challenges that continue to play out in the courts.\n\nWith Thanksgiving and Christmas fast approaching and federal court orders putting a hold on the operational deployment of the Guard, top Pentagon officials decided last week to withdraw the out-of-state soldiers, at least for now, rather than have them continue to sit in a costly limbo separated from their families during the holiday season, one U.S. official said.\n\nAbout 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain activated in the Chicago area, as will about 200 soldiers from the Oregon National Guard in the Portland area, the officials said.\n\nThe Pentagon has not formally announced the impending Guard withdrawals, which were reported earlier by ABC News, but the military’s Northern Command indicated late on Friday that changes to the federalized troop mission in those cities were imminent.\n\nThe command offered no details, however, when it posted on social media that “in the coming days, the Department will be shifting and/or rightsizing our Title 10 footprint in Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago to ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.”\n\nThe Texas and California Guard members had been activated on federal orders by Mr. Trump in early October and placed on active-duty status according to Title 10 of the U.S. Code. “Our troops in each city (and others) are trained and ready, and will be employed whenever needed to support law enforcement and keep our citizens safe,” Northern Command said in its statement on Friday.\n\nOregon officials were not immediately available for comment on the Pentagon’s decision. A federal judge in Portland earlier this month issued a permanent block on troop deployments to the city in response to demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMatt Hill, a spokesman for Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, said state officials had not yet been notified of the Pentagon’s action.\n\n“While there are reports the Texas guard is leaving, the Trump Administration is also saying they will keep federalizing national guards to ‘ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence’ in cities,” Mr. Hill posted on social media. “Illinois will continue fighting for our state sovereignty, protecting people’s rights, and keeping our communities peaceful.”\n\nA federal judge in Illinois issued a temporary restraining order last month blocking the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area. An appeals panel later upheld the lower-court judge’s decision and the U.S. Supreme Court is now weighing the issue.\n\nIn California, officials in the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the federal deployment, said Northern Command had notified them that it would begin drawing down the California National Guard from Portland as early as Sunday.\n\nA spokesman for the governor, Izzy Gardon, applauded the decision, but also condemned the deployment, which has gone on since June and has been authorized to extend into next year. Last week, California asked the federal court again to halt the deployment in that state and release the remaining 300 federalized California National Guard troops.\n\nThe president “never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place,” Mr. Gardon said. “We’re glad they’re finally coming home. It’s long overdue.”\n\nShawn Hubler, Mitch Smith and Anna Griffin contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkz42yz35do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"00:31:20.721+00:00","title":"The oil pipeline feud testing Canada's global ambitions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada is facing a deepening political and environmental rift between Alberta and British Columbia over a proposal for a new oil pipeline from Alberta’s oil sands to British Columbia’s Pacific coast, aiming to redirect energy exports to Asian markets and reduce dependence on the US.

Not everyone is on board.\n\nThe oil-rich province of Alberta has had one demand for Prime Minister Mark Carney: Help us build an oil pipeline — and fast.\n\nIt's no small task — in fact, some argue it has become near-impossible to build a pipeline in Canada because of laws designed to bolster environmental protections. Three oil pipelines have died on the vine in the past decade over fierce opposition.\n\nBut Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is not deterred.\n\nHer conservative government has taken the unusual step of drafting its own proposal for a pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to British Columbia's northern Pacific coast, aimed at reaching Asian markets. Still in the early stages, Smith hopes that by doing the groundwork a private company will eventually take over and build it.\n\nNeighbouring British Columbia, however, is firmly against it. Premier David Eby, with the left-leaning NDP, has dismissed Smith's plan as \"fictional\" and \"political\", arguing no company wants the burden of taking it on. He also accused Smith of jeopardising his own province's ambitions to expand liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Asia.\n\nSmith in turn, has called him \"un-Canadian\".\n\nThe feud between the Western provinces comes at a critical time. Canada is trying to wean itself off its economic dependence on the US amid President Donald Trump's tariffs, and Carney has signalled his desire to double non-US exports in the next decade.\n\nThat includes positioning Canada as a global \"energy superpower\". Almost all of its energy exports, including crude oil, are currently sold to the US.\n\nOn Thursday, Carney unveiled new \"nation-building projects\" he says are key to Canada's growth. The list did not include a pipeline, but does include critical minerals mines and an LNG project in BC.\n\nWith Canada home to one of the world's largest oil reserves, Carney is now facing questions from Albertans over whether he can achieve his goals without first solving the internal rifts.\n\n\"It is the perennial problem,\" said Heather Exner-Pirot, director of natural resources, energy and the environment at the MacDonald-Laurier Institute think tank, and who is based in Calgary, Alberta.\n\n\"It is unfortunately the main wedge issue in Canadian politics it seems like, and trust me when I say no one in Alberta wishes that their oil was the wedge issue in this country.\"\n\nAsked about the divides on Thursday, Carney said the federal government and the provinces \"need to talk to each other\".\n\n\"We need to see where we can cooperate and build things, and we need to acknowledge where we can't.\"\n\nSeparately, Carney has hinted that he wants to see another pipeline built: Keystone XL to the US. Sources have told the BBC that reviving the project was raised during the prime minister's last face-to-face meeting with Trump in October,  before the US president halted trade talks with Canada over an anti-tariff ad.\n\nFor Ms Exner-Pirot, the suggestion of Keystone XL may signal a resignation that the rift between BC and Alberta won't be resolved.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it still looks like it's going to be easier to negotiate a new pipeline with the Americans than with British Columbia.\"\n\nCarney has avoided siding with either province but has signalled his openness to a pipeline if Alberta can commit to also developing its carbon capture and storage programme. He said discussions \"are going well\".\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Smith's office said it is \"working to address\" Premier Eby's concerns. But it said it expects Carney's government to support their project.\n\n\"We have to decide if we are going to operate like a country and trade with each other, tear down internal trade barriers and stop blocking each other's projects and opportunities to trade with the rest of the world,\" Smith's spokesperson, Sam Blackett, said in an email.\n\nThe BBC contacted Premier Eby's office for comment, who pointed to remarks the BC leader made to reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"There is no route, there is no proponent, there is no project,\" he said, adding he remains \"frustrated that this appears to be an ongoing issue for Premier Smith\".\n\nThe disagreement between BC and Alberta is part of a longstanding clash that successive federal governments have struggled to smooth over.\n\nBritish Columbia is historically home to Canada's environmental movement – it's the birthplace of Greenpeace, one of the world's largest climate organisations.\n\nAlberta's main export by far is crude petroleum, and it has long defended its oil and gas industry as vital to Canada's economic growth.\n\n\"There are real grounds for a dispute,\" said Andrew Leach, a Canadian energy economist at the University of Alberta. \"The lion's share of the gains and the benefits accrue to Alberta, while the lion's share of generational risks occur in BC.\"\n\nIt was opposition in British Columbia that led to the cancellation of Enbridge's Alberta to BC Northern Gateway pipeline project. It was scrapped in 2016 after courts ruled that indigenous communities were not properly consulted. Enbridge said it spent more than C$370m ($263m; £200m) on the failed project.\n\nAsked about Alberta's new proposal, Enbridge spokesperson Gina Sutherland told the BBC that the federal government needs to improve its regulatory policies \"before any new large energy projects would be considered\".\n\nAlberta says those policies, including an oil tanker ban off the coast of BC, which both Premier Eby and BC indigenous leaders want to keep in place, are hindering energy development.\n\nThe sole oil pipeline running from Alberta to BC, TransMountain (TMX), was also strongly opposed and only finished after the federal government purchased it for C$4.5bn in 2018 to ensure its completion. The total cost for the project was C$35bn.\n\nTMX is estimated to have since generated more than C$12.6bn in oil revenue for Canada, according to  a report by Alberta Central , and has helped  non-US crude oil exports jump sixfold  in the last year.\n\nAn October  poll from the Angus Reid Institute  shows a majority of Canadians (59%) support the idea of a second Alberta-BC pipeline, including 56% of BC residents.\n\nBut indigenous sovereignty and environmental are still significant factors - Canada has pledged to halving its greenhouse emissions by 2035. The country has seen the impact of climate change firsthand, including  a recent string   of  its worst wildfire seasons  on record.\n\nKeith Brooks, director of programmes at Environmental Defence Canada, said he believes any move towards a new pipeline would be met with a backlash.\n\n\"We would condemn it quite loudly,\" Mr Brooks said predicting legal challenges from First Nations communities along its route, as well as protests.\n\nHe argued that an oil pipeline would also take years to build, and therefore do little to address Canada's  immediate financial challenges.\n\n\"It does nothing for us today,\" he said.\n\nThe opposition appears to already be taking shape.\n\n\"Our communities will not be collateral for private profit,\" said Chief Na'Moks of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation in northwest BC, who was among a group of indigenous leaders who had gathered to protest the prime minister's Thursday announcement.\n\n\"This is colonial violence masked as 'economic development,' and the world is watching.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkl3d6pegpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"00:17:43.171+00:00","title":"How realistic is the plan to build a 'drone wall' against Russia?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing threat of Russian drone incursions into Western Europe, including attacks on Poland, Belgium, and other NATO countries.

tannoy: \"Your attention please. Air siren in the city. Please move to the shelter on the minus second floor.\" Then comes the mosquito-like whine of the incoming Russian drones, massing in their hundreds just above the clouds.\n\nIt's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens.\n\nThis is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine.\n\nThese are attack drones that explode on impact.\n\nDrones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield.\n\nAcross western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of \"hybrid warfare\" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine.\n\nRecent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries.\n\nNow, there is talk that a \"drone wall\" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic?\n\nOn 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports.\n\nNato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions.\n\nThis was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began.\n\nWhich is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing.\n\n\"This momentum really driven by these recent incursions,\" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank.\n\nDrones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space.\n\nOn the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices.\n\nBut these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall.\n\nPreviously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September.\n\nSo, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond?\n\nAfter all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: \"[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money.\"\n\nUkraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians.\n\nThen there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nBut there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war.\n\nThat is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared.\n\nSometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports, including one in Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania.\n\nUnlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these \"civilian drones\" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships.\n\nSuspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility.\n\nBelgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions).\n\nThere is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base?\n\nThe UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones.\n\nStill, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants.\n\nThe plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia.\n\nThe wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea.\n\nIt's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027.\n\nNot surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia.\n\nKatja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue.\n\nBut she adds:  \"This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders.\"\n\nNonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic.\n\nRobert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some \"sort of impervious wall\", is, in his words, out of the question.\n\nYet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try.\n\n\"For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,\" he says.\n\n\"The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable\", agrees Ms Bego.\n\n\"It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them.\"\n\nFabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones.\n\n\"You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets.\n\n\"You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill.\"\n\nHard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders.\n\nAs for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters.\n\n\"You can have lasers which could be useful as well,\" he adds, \"but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be.\"\n\nAndré Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once.\n\nAs tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called \"hybrid\" or \"grey zone\" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them.\n\nThese include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables.\n\nAnd yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority.\n\nThe first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised.\n\nMeanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge.\n\nMr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. \"You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres.\n\n\"And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap.\"\n\nThe question of finance is a complex one. \"It is a really difficult defence question,\" says Mr Tollast. \"Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well.\n\n\"So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people.\"\n\nIt will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets.\n\nInitially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it.\n\n\"Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion...\n\n\"The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets\".\n\nAs for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, \"they can definitely achieve more protection by then\".\n\nWhile all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them.\n\nThis all makes it something of a new arms race.\n\n\"The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,\" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology.\n\n\"It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust.\n\n\"The aggressor\", he concludes, \"will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through\".\n\nSo are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow.\n\n\"It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,\" argues Ms Bego.\n\n\"And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this.\"\n\nBut any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory.\n\nEver since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war.\n\nBuilding a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another.\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images, Sketchfab\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Alex Santora ascended to the pulpit of the Church of Our Lady of Grace and St. Joseph,  looked out at the people gathered beneath stained glass and soaring gothic columns that were created largely by Irish immigrants in the 19th century, and told a story of a local immigrant in modern times.\n\nThe man came from Cuba more than 40 years ago, started a business and raised a family. But he had gotten into some minor legal trouble in the 1980s. And this year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement came for him. He had to close his business, lay off his workers, and leave the country.\n\n“In the last 10 months, we’re hearing about a lot of pain, people whose lives are abandoned and ruined, and not just a few,” Father Santora told parishioners at the church in Hoboken, N.J., during mass on Saturday evening.\n\nIn humble rural churches and tall urban cathedrals across the country this weekend, Catholic priests and parishioners reflected on the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Some said that the roundup of hundreds of thousands of people, which has disproportionately affected Catholic congregations full of immigrants, goes against Christian teachings.\n\nJust a few miles from Our Lady of Grace, said Father Santora, about 1,000 immigrants were being held in a detention center. “This is not what Jesus Christ would want,” he told his flock. “It’s immoral.”\n\nThe Trump administration says that its immigration enforcement campaign will break deportation records by the end of the year. Teams of agents, often using military-style equipment, have raided factories, construction sites and apartment blocks and detained people at schools, churches and big-box stores.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in late October that it had deported 527,000 “illegal aliens” this year and pushed another 1.6 million to leave the country voluntarily. A record 66,000 immigrants were in federal detention, according to the agency.  Agency spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in October, “This is just the beginning.”\n\nAs the administration has stepped up its deportation efforts, though, the Catholic Church has gotten louder in its criticism. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on Wednesday issued a special message — the first since 2013 — opposing what it called the “indiscriminate mass deportation of people.”\n\n“We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants,” the bishops wrote. “We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care.”\n\nAt the end of their message, they said, “We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said it was focused on “removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from American communities, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, drug dealers, and more.”\n\nThe agency said that 70 percent of arrests were of immigrants charged with or convicted of a crime in the United States. But an analysis of federal data by The New York Times shows that fewer than 40 percent had a criminal conviction, and only about 8 percent had been convicted of a violent crime.\n\nIn Hoboken, Father Santora pointed around the church, speaking about how Our Lady of Grace was built by immigrants more than a century ago.\n\n“Their nickels, dimes and quarters built this church. They employed all the people who designed, engineered, constructed and furnished it,” he said.\n\n“We know that immigrants have built our country, and they fuel our economy,” he added.\n\nAt the Church of St. Mary in nearby Rutherford, Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, 73, was presiding over a Sunday afternoon Mass after returning from the U.S. Council of Bishops meeting. After mass, he described the moment when the bishops agreed to the content of their letter about the immigration crisis as the greatest show of unanimity he’d ever seen in the body. “And when the final vote count was flashed up on the screen in the meeting hall, people spontaneously stood up and applauded,” he said.\n\n“We’re concerned about what we see going on in the country,” the cardinal added. “While we certainly do not deny the obligation of a state to regulate its borders, everyone from the Holy Father and several Holy Fathers down have made it quite clear that having laws isn’t enough. They have to be based on compassion and justice.”\n\nAcross the Hudson River in Manhattan, at the Church of St. Francis Xavier in Manhattan, Rev. Kenneth Boller also addressed the bishops’ letter during mass.\n\n“The church is like a mother. When the world sees threats, she sees children. When walls are built, she builds bridges,” Father Boller said. “She knows that her proclamation in the Gospel is credible only when it is translated into gestures of closeness and welcome. And she knows that in every rejected migrant, it is Christ himself.”\n\nOther churches chose not to address the topic directly on Sunday. Still, some parishioners said they welcomed the bishops’ strong statement.\n\nCharlotte Lesslie, 20, attended mass with her parents at St. Andrew Catholic Church, in Clemson, S.C.\n\n“I felt like it was good stating just that every human being deserves dignity and deserves love and deserves to be treated like they were made in the image and likeness of our Lord,” she said. “They weren’t saying that any one person is bad, but just that maybe some of the things that are going on aren’t really what is asked of us as people, as Christians.”\n\nAt St. Thomas Mission in Brownsville, Texas, Rev. Joel Flores did not directly mention the letter. But he said in an interview before mass that there was nothing new in the bishops’ statement about immigration, adding, “It’s a statement the church has been making since its conception.”\n\n“Any institution which does something against the value of human life is worthy of the church making a statement,” Father Flores said.\n\nDeportations have put his parish in the Rio Grande Valley, which has a high number of Spanish-speaking immigrants, on edge. Father Flores said there has been a significant drop in the number of people attending mass in recent months because parishioners fear they will be picked up by federal agents.\n\n“There’s a system that is deporting or potentially deporting people indiscriminately,” he said. “People are asking questions like, why me, or why them, or am I next?”\n\nRobert Chiarito, Sarah Goodman, Jesse Klein and Alison Hill contributed to this report.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/mississippi-jail-inmates-rankin-county.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-28","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00+00:00","title":"Escalation of Conflict in Region X Following Ceasefire Violation","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The conflict in Region X has intensified following the violation of the Ceasefire Agreement of March 30th.

They beat people behind closed doors. And they encouraged favored inmates to join in on the brutality.\n\nFormer inmates and guards said the violence at the Rankin County jail created a culture of fear and was widely accepted by officials as a way of keeping order, an investigation by The New York Times and Mississippi Today has found.\n\nMore than a dozen former inmates recounted being beaten for nonviolent infractions, like talking back to guards or getting caught with contraband. Many said a special group of inmates, known as trusties, helped guards beat troublemakers, lending fists whenever needed. Sometimes, the jail’s highest-ranking officials instigated the punishments or handed them down themselves, according to former guards and inmates.\n\nThe Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, which runs the jail, has a documented history of brazen violence. Last year, the Justice Department began investigating the agency for potential civil rights violations after The Times and Mississippi Today revealed that a group of detectives and patrol deputies, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” had been torturing suspected drug users for nearly 20 years.\n\nThis portrait of life inside the Rankin County jail is drawn from interviews with more than 70 former inmates. Many of their descriptions of widespread violence are supported by medical records and photographs, as well as incident reports written by guards and a video that shows guards shocking a man with an electrified vest.\n\nFour former guards, three of whom asked to remain anonymous, also said they had witnessed unjustified beatings by other guards and trusties. Most described the violence as a weekly occurrence.\n\nIn a statement, the department’s attorney, Jason Dare, called the reporting “baseless.” The Rankin County jail, he wrote, “is one of the cleanest and best-run jails in Mississippi, with jailers never having been found to use excessive force in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n\nAfter reviewing the findings, Sean Tindell, the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said on Wednesday that agents from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation had been assigned to investigate the allegations.\n\nSince 2013, at least 11 inmates from the jail have sued the department, alleging that they had been assaulted by guards or trusties. The vast majority represented themselves, and most of the lawsuits were dismissed because of missed deadlines and court fees, or other technicalities.\n\nThe attacks, described in the lawsuits and in interviews with former guards and inmates, ranged in severity from slaps and whippings to brutal beatings that left inmates with bloody wounds and broken bones. Three guards and nearly two dozen former inmates said that trusties and guards would purposefully drag inmates into areas with no surveillance cameras before beating them.\n\nMorgan Curtis, a former trusty who has been in and out of the jail since 2015, said the way guards would order trusties to attack inmates was “like a command to a pack of dogs.”\n\nIn interviews, nine former trusties, most of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation, admitted to helping guards beat inmates. They said the highest-ranking trusties were expected to back up guards during volatile situations or attack inmates so that guards would not have to do so themselves.\n\nThis group of trusties, recognizable by their blue jumpsuits, earned a nickname: the Blue Wave.\n\nOne former trusty described an incident from 2020. He said that on the orders of guards, he beat an inmate who had flooded his cell, kicking him repeatedly.\n\nThe following year, the jail’s top administrator, Barry Vaughn, confronted an inmate who had failed a drug test. Mr. Vaughn punched him so hard, the inmate said, that it broke his nose and knocked out two dental crowns.\n\nChristian Dedmon, one of five former Rankin County deputies who was sentenced to federal prison for torturing two Black men in 2024, said that while he was working at the department he had watched Mr. Vaughn beat inmates in his office. A former guard described seeing several similar beatings. Mr. Vaughn declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nIn 2019, a man who briefly escaped the jail was lifted into the air by his throat and choked by a sheriff’s deputy, several inmates and a guard said. Bryan Bailey, the sheriff of the department, later bragged about the incident, according to Mr. Dedmon.\n\nMr. Dedmon has sent hundreds of emails from a federal prison in New Jersey, describing how his willingness to partake in violence helped him rise through the ranks. He has said that he wanted it known that the brutalities he committed were part of a deeply ingrained culture at the department.\n\nHe previously shared information about the use of taxpayer-funded equipment at Sheriff Bailey’s family farm, allegations that led to an investigation by the state auditor.\n\n“They made me powerful and respected, made me actually feel like somebody, like I had done a good job,” Mr. Dedmon wrote. “It’s OK to beat drug addicts, it’s OK to take from the taxpayer, so why would I not mirror them?”\n\nThe Rankin County Adult Detention Center is tucked behind the courthouse on the main drag of Brandon, a town of about 25,000 people with one of the lowest crime rates in the state.\n\nSeveral hundred inmates, many of them accused of drug crimes and other nonviolent offenses, live in rows of beige cells stacked two stories high. Many have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting their day in court.\n\nOver ten months, reporters examined 69 alleged incidents of violence against inmates at the jail that occurred from 2012 to 2024.\n\nThey included 21 encounters in which guards documented that they had used force against inmates, and why, in incident reports. These reports are routinely filed whenever guards encounter issues. Their descriptions of violence differed greatly from what inmates said had happened.\n\nBut in a number of cases, reporters were able to interview eyewitnesses who supported the accounts of the victims. In several cases, medical records corroborated the injuries that inmates described.\n\nIn the case of Larry Buckhalter, the violence was filmed — by a guard.\n\nIn 2018, Mr. Buckhalter began a one-year sentence for possessing a small amount of cocaine. He was intellectually disabled, his family said, and people often took advantage of him.\n\nAccording to three former guards who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Buckhalter was nicknamed “Crying Larry” by guards and other inmates because he had a habit of pestering jail staff with small requests.\n\nOne day, he asked for a Coca-Cola. A cellphone video obtained by The Times and Mississippi Today shows Mr. Buckhalter sitting quietly in a chair, strapped into a stun vest that is typically used to control violent inmates during court hearings.\n\nOff camera, a man jokes that Mr. Buckhalter is going to bite off his tongue. A woman, who is also off camera, tells Mr. Buckhalter to give his consent.\n\nMr. Buckhalter takes a deep breath. “My name Larry and I volunteer to this,” he says.\n\nThe vest is activated. Mr. Buckhalter screams as his body convulses.\n\n“Now you get a Coke,” the woman says. “It’s all over! I’m so proud of you, Larry!”\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Dare, the department attorney, did not address the guards’ actions. He criticized the reporting as “alleged rumors by unnamed sources who have no personal, first-hand knowledge of events,” and pointed out that reporters had not spoken to Mr. Buckhalter, who died in 2021.\n\nMr. Tindell, Mississippi’s public safety commissioner, called the video “appalling and utterly unacceptable.”\n\nDavid Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that using force can be justified in certain circumstances, like if an inmate poses a threat; but doing so without cause or as punishment, he said, is “categorically inappropriate.” Corporal punishment in U.S. jails and prisons was deemed unconstitutional in the 1960s.\n\nMr. Fathi reviewed several incident reports filed by guards. He said the reasons they cited for using force were so vague that they should have raised red flags to supervisors, and that the justifications fell far short of the typical threshold followed by jails and prisons.\n\nIn one such report, a guard wrote that he had struck an inmate, Dustin Rives, in the face because Mr. Rives had verbally threatened another guard. The blow broke Mr. Rives’s jaw, medical records show. Another report stated that guards struck Carvis Johnson and threw him to the floor in 2020 because he yelled threats and turned toward them after being ordered to face a wall.\n\nFor years, the man in charge of monitoring the jail was Mr. Vaughn, a captain who was recently promoted to undersheriff, making him second-in-command of the sheriff’s department.\n\nAccording to a former deputy, a former guard and 14 former inmates, Mr. Vaughn often beat inmates who broke the rules, slapping and whipping them during interrogations in his office.\n\n“ When you walked through his door, he had a shelf. And on the side of the shelf, he had like a wooden stick, a wooden baseball bat, two or three antennas,” said Cameron Kennedy, a former inmate who said Mr. Vaughn had questioned him on several occasions.\n\nIn June 2021, Mr. Vaughn called Mr. Kennedy and several other trusties who had failed drug tests into his office, one by one.\n\nWhen Mr. Kennedy refused to explain where they had gotten the drugs, he said, Mr. Vaughn slapped him hard enough to give him a black eye.\n\nThree of the other men who had failed drug tests said Mr. Vaughn had punched or whipped them with a car antenna. One of the men was Woodrow Lamont Lewis, the trusty who said Mr. Vaughn had knocked out his dental crowns that day. The men said they also saw other inmates return bloodied and bruised from Mr. Vaughn’s office.\n\nA few months after the failed drug test, Mr. Kennedy was caught with a cellphone, an incident report shows. Mr. Vaughn handcuffed him to a chair and struck his shins and thighs with a car antenna, he said.\n\n“He never did stop,” said Mr. Kennedy. “I’m talking about, like, 10 or 15 minutes, rapping me with it.”\n\nMr. Dedmon, the former deputy who is in prison, wrote in an email that he once saw Mr. Vaughn repeatedly punch an inmate who had smuggled drugs into the jail.\n\nMr. Vaughn directed reporters to speak with the department’s attorney, who denied the allegations.\n\nSome of the country’s first trusty programs began in the early 1900s in Mississippi prisons.\n\nPlaces like Parchman, a notorious prison in the Mississippi Delta, were known to select trusties from among their most violent inmates. The trusties, armed with guns and whips, were tasked with disciplining other inmates or forcing them to perform backbreaking work in cotton fields.\n\nA federal court ruling in 1972 deemed trusty-on-prisoner violence unconstitutional, leading to the widespread dismantling of the programs in prisons across the nation.\n\nToday, modern versions of trusty programs are common in county jails, though participants are generally banned from using physical force. These programs put nonviolent offenders to work, helping them learn job skills.\n\nIn Rankin County, many former trusties spoke glowingly about the program, crediting it with turning their lives around.\n\n“It was the biggest blessing in my life,” said Cameron McKenzie, a former trusty. “I’ve been out now 20 months. I’m married, got full custody of both my kids, just bought a house, good job, you name it.”\n\nMany inmates in the county jail are there only for short periods, while they await sentencing, but trusties usually serve their entire sentence in the facility, rising through the ranks over months or even years.\n\nThe most senior trusties — those who earn blue suits — have far better living conditions than other inmates. Former trusties said they slept in their own cellblock, in unlocked cells, and sometimes got passes to visit their families.\n\nMany could roam the facility freely, play video games and work outside the jail. One former trusty, Cameron McCaskill, said he was allowed to keep a pet dog and order pizza.\n\n“A blue suit is unrestricted,” Sheriff Bailey said during a 2020 interview with a Mississippi lobbying group. “Once they get a blue suit status, that is almost like being an employee here.”\n\nMr. Dare said trusties were not allowed to use force.\n\n“ I do not believe that is specifically spelled out in a policy,” he said in an interview. “I do know it is a practice that trusties do not go hands-on.”\n\nBut several former guards and participants of the program said that the jail staff expected some trusties to provide extra muscle in exchange for their privileges.\n\n“ If something is going on with the officer and they need assistance, you need to be there,” said Mr. Lewis, the former trusty. “If you ain’t there to help them, whether they are winning or losing, then you already know you’re next.”\n\nThree others said trusties were rewarded, sometimes with “free world” food, for joining the violence.\n\n“People would do just about anything for a cigarette, or a box of Church’s chicken with a honey biscuit,” said Phillip Smith, a former trusty. “That was the motivation of the Blue Wave.”\n\nDozens of former inmates, including many who participated in the program, said they had witnessed trusties hitting or kicking other inmates, or holding them down while guards beat them.\n\nOf the 11 inmates who have sued the sheriff’s department since 2013, five said in their lawsuits that trusties attacked them with guards. All but one had their lawsuits dismissed.\n\nCarvis Johnson, an inmate who had a long history of disciplinary infractions, claimed in a 2020 lawsuit that he had been beaten by guards and trusties. Court records show that Mr. Johnson settled his lawsuit, but the department declined to provide further details about the settlement.\n\nIncident reports show that a confrontation began after Mr. Johnson shoved feces under his cell door and broke a sprinkler, flooding his cell. Trusties were brought in to clean up the mess. Guards led Mr. Johnson out of his cell and knocked him to the floor after he verbally threatened them, the reports show.\n\nIn an interview, Brock Reed, a former trusty, said a guard told a group of trusties to give Mr. Johnson “a sample” and that they should beat him because they would be the ones stuck cleaning up his mess.\n\nMr. Reed said the guards led Mr. Johnson to a corner widely known for being a camera blind spot. A supervisor’s routine review of the incident confirmed that there was no security camera footage of what happened, in part because “hallway camera does not show where inmate was in the hall.”\n\nWhen Mr. Johnson hit the floor, Mr. Reed kicked him in the hip and lower back, he said.\n\n“I wasn’t going to be the one trusty to tell the police, ‘No, I’m not doing this,’” he said. “I know how they look at you for that.”\n\nChristopher Mack, a former inmate, sued the department last year, claiming that trusties and guards beat him in 2021. When he made bail and left the jail with twin black eyes the next day, Mr. Mack said, Sheriff Bailey approached him and asked who had caused his injuries.\n\n“ I looked at him and said, ‘Mr. Bailey, you know who did this to me, your officers and trusties did this to me,’” Mr. Mack said.\n\nThe sheriff cursed under his breath, Mr. Mack said, and stormed off.\n\nIn September 2019, William Keith Richards found out what could happen to trusties who took advantage of their freedom.\n\nMr. Richards, a blue-suit, had nearly completed his sentence when he walked out of the jail one Friday. Officials did not notice he was gone until he missed church that Sunday, an incident report shows.\n\nWhen Mr. Richards was caught, other blue-suit trusties were ordered to gather at a garage entrance of the jail, where Sheriff Bailey berated them for not informing guards of the escape, four former trusties said in interviews.\n\nSheriff Bailey told the trusties that they should take a good look at Mr. Richards, because he was the reason they were about to lose their special privileges, two of them said.\n\nMr. Richards was escorted back to the jail by Deputy Wes Shivers, a 6-foot-8 former U.F.C. fighter. After they arrived, Mr. Shivers lifted the inmate into the air by his throat and choked him, said two former trusties and a former guard. In an interview, Mr. Shivers confirmed that he had returned Mr. Richards to the jail but denied choking him.\n\nIt is unclear whether Sheriff Bailey saw the incident or when he left the room. Mr. Shivers said he could not recall whether the sheriff was nearby when he arrived with Mr. Richards.\n\nA group of guards and trusties dragged Mr. Richards into the jail’s dressing room, which was known to not have cameras, and beat him, according to four former inmates familiar with the incident.\n\nThey saw Mr. Richards in the days following, and said his face was swollen and his neck was ringed with bruises.\n\n“They did a number on him,” Mr. Reed said.\n\nMr. Richards declined to comment for this article, citing fears for his safety. Mr. Bailey declined a request to comment, deferring to the department’s attorney. In a statement, Mr. Dare, who called the reporting “baseless,” did not address whether Mr. Bailey was present during the incident.\n\nThe department did not produce reports detailing Mr. Richards’s capture despite repeated requests.\n\nDuring email exchanges with reporters, Mr. Dedmon recounted the sheriff bragging to him and others about how Mr. Shivers had choked an inmate who had escaped.\n\n“Bailey used to talk about it,” Mr. Dedmon wrote. “I can just remember Bailey saying, ‘Wes held him up against the wall with one hand.’”\n\nThe Times and Mississippi Today obtained formal grievance documents from lawyers who sued the department, providing a rare window into how jail officials handled inmate complaints. From 2018 to 2022, eight inmates filed grievances that described assaults by guards or trusties.\n\nIn 2022, Mr. Rives, the inmate whose jaw was broken by a guard, filed a grievance. Jail incident reports show that after Mr. Rives was struck, guards strapped him into a restraint chair overnight and then locked him in an isolation cell for 25 days. It was there where he filed his grievance, saying he had not been taken to the hospital. His jaw was infected by the time he was hospitalized and required surgery, according to medical records.\n\n“ It never healed,” he said. “ If I take a bite out of a hamburger, it’ll lock up and pop and grind like you wouldn’t believe.”\n\nA report from Mr. Rives’s grievance file shows that a supervisor closed his complaint three days after it had been filed, saying the department had documented the incident and provided a “satisfactory response,” which included scheduling a hospital visit for Mr. Rives and informing him that he could not press criminal charges against the guard while incarcerated.\n\nMr. Rives said the department did not contact him again.\n\nThe report does not indicate whether the guard who broke Mr. Rives’s jaw, Jordan McQueary, was disciplined or questioned about the incident. Mr. Rives is among at least nine inmates who have filed complaints or federal lawsuits claiming they were assaulted by Mr. McQueary, who still works at the department.\n\nLast year, the department honored Mr. McQueary for his “outstanding” work.\n\nHe did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt least six other grievances were closed under similar circumstances, with no indication that the guards or trusties accused of violence were interviewed or disciplined.\n\nSupervisors also listed “satisfactory response” as the reason for closing three other complaints. The forms do not define the term, and department representatives did not respond to requests for clarification.\n\nTwo former trusties who spoke to The Times and Mississippi Today about their experiences said they have since been confronted by jail officials about their interviews.\n\nJohn Phillips, a former trusty who said he witnessed and participated in violence between 2017 and 2021, was brought back to the Rankin County jail in August to face new criminal charges.\n\nWhile there, he was taken to Mr. Vaughn’s office, where Mr. Vaughn and Mr. Dare questioned him about what he had told the publications.\n\nMr. Phillips then wrote and signed a statement contradicting the comments he had made to reporters. His lawyer was not present during the meeting, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Dare said.\n\n“I never seen anything that the news reporters are talking about when spoken about inmates on inmates or the Blue Wave,” the statement reads, according to a copy provided by Mr. Dare. “There is no wrong doing at the Rankin jail or in the program.”\n\nIn a later interview, Mr. Phillips stressed that his statements to reporters had been true, and that he had felt pressured by the officials to write the letter. Mr. Dare said he had not pressured Mr. Phillips. He provided a recording of a portion of the August interaction in which Mr. Phillips says he is giving his statement voluntarily.\n\nMr. Dare said that he had collected similar statements from several other former trusties, but he declined to share their names.\n\n“I sit down and try to meet with folks, figure out what they know,” he said in an interview last month. “I’m trying to defend the trusty program, that’s all.”\n\nThis article was supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the Alicia Patterson Foundation.\n\nThis story was co-reported by Steph Quinn.

Charlotte, N.C.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T14:39:49-05:00\n\nFederal Border Patrol agents arrested 81 people in immigrant neighborhoods across the Charlotte, N.C., area on Saturday, the first day of an operation that has already drawn significant criticism over its aggressive tactics.\n\nAn immigrant rights group said it was the largest single-day tally for immigrant arrests in the state’s recent history.\n\nThe operation has startled people in one of the fastest growing cities in the country, whose growth in recent years has been spurred by international migration, especially from Latin America. The Border Patrol agents fanned out across immigrant neighborhoods once again on Sunday, prompting many businesses that cater to immigrants to close for now.\n\nA flea market that is typically filled with Hispanic vendors was canceled this weekend. Nightclubs in the city that play reggaeton music on Saturday nights decided not to open. Catholic churches were unusually empty on Sunday morning; immigrant advocates said that federal agents were present outside church parking lots.\n\nGregory Bovino, the leader of the Border Patrol operation in Charlotte, who also led agents in Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year, has already declared the North Carolina mission to be a success. He posted photos on social media of five detained people who he said had criminal histories.\n\nNeither Mr. Bovino, who is from western North Carolina, nor the Department of Homeland Security has said exactly how many of the 81 people arrested on Saturday had criminal histories.\n\nFew of the hundreds of people who were arrested in the Chicago and Los Angeles operations had serious criminal backgrounds. But the Trump administration has said that it considers anyone who is present in the United States without legal status to be a criminal, and have used that view to justify its enforcement operations.\n\nIn Charlotte, lawyers and immigrant advocacy groups said a familiar pattern appeared to be emerging there as well. The people who were arrested or approached by agents on Saturday, they said, included a man participating in a church cleanup day, workers at a Home Depot, a landscaper putting up Christmas decorations and a Hispanic U.S. citizen whose truck window was shattered by an agent.\n\n“This is a day of shame,” said Nikki Marín Baena, co-director of Siembra NC, an immigrant advocacy group. “It’s a shameful day for the North Carolina Republican Party, who hailed the arrival of so-called law enforcement officers carrying out terrorist operations, and echoed Greg Bovino’s talking points about ‘going after criminals.’”\n\nSiembra NC said that before Saturday, the largest numbers of immigrant arrests in the state in single days were 30 people in June and 27 in February 2019.\n\nOn Saturday, Matt Mercer, a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, said: “We’re grateful to see these brave men and women in federal law enforcement following through on President Trump’s promise to remove violent criminal illegals from our country and those stoking fear about these targeted operations must stop at once.”\n\nOfficials in Charlotte and in Mecklenburg County, which includes the city, had been bracing for Mr. Bovino’s operation this week, and had warned residents who wished to protest to do so peacefully and not allow the agents’ presence to provoke them. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, expressed concern about the agents’ arrival, saying in a statement that “when we see injustice, we bear witness.”\n\n“If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe long after these federal agents leave,” Mr. Stein said. “That’s the North Carolina way.”\n\nThe arrival of Border Patrol in Charlotte, a moderately Democratic city known for its booming banking industry, has puzzled many people in the state. Federal law limits the Border Patrol’s focus to the country’s 6,000 miles of international borders and a zone extending about 100 miles inland from the borders and the coastline. But Charlotte is nowhere near the Mexican border, and is about 170 miles from the nearest point on the coast.\n\nIt remains unclear how long the operation in Charlotte will last. The federal agents are expected to head next to New Orleans. Mayor Esther Manheimer of Asheville, N.C., said on Friday that her city may also become a target in the future.\n\nThis is a developing story. It will be updated.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/us/calvin-duncan-new-orleans-criminal-court-clerk.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"15:03:37-05:00","title":"Calvin Duncan’s Unlikely Journey: Convict to Exoneree to Elected Official","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Calvin Duncan, once wrongfully convicted of a 1981 murder and sentenced to life in prison, spent 28 years behind bars before being exonerated.

After 28 years behind bars, he won his freedom, cleared his name and, at the age of 60, graduated from law school.\n\nThen came an even more improbable twist: On Saturday, voters in New Orleans elected Mr. Duncan to serve as clerk of the parish criminal court, defeating an incumbent from a prominent political family, according to preliminary results.\n\nThe post doesn’t usually attract much attention. The job is bureaucratic and technical, overseeing the ever-expanding trove of records and evidence from court cases in New Orleans. But Mr. Duncan aimed his campaign at persuading voters that the work is vital to the pursuit of justice.\n\nHe argued that his experience as a lawyer and advocate — and also as someone whose freedom hinged on access to his court records — made him ideally suited to modernize an office that has relied on outdated methods.\n\n“Tonight is a dream that’s been 40 years in the making,” Mr. Duncan said on Saturday after declaring victory. “I hope that all those people who died in prison because we couldn’t get their records are looking down now. I hope they’re proud of me. We never stopped fighting for each other’s rights, and I will never stop fighting for yours.”\n\nMr. Duncan’s bid for the office was seen at first as a long shot. It was catapulted to credibility late in the race, after the incumbent, Darren Lombard, claimed that Mr. Duncan had never really been exonerated of the 1981 crime that had led to his incarceration, and publicly asserted that Mr. Duncan had ties to a “coldblooded murder.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Pandemic. Now, Some Feel Trapped.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T14:24:04-05:00\n\nWhen Sandy Lachhman and Shaun Parmassar started house-hunting on Long Island in early 2022, buying a home felt like a race against time.\n\nMortgage rates were ticking up from record lows, and listings seemed to disappear quickly. Both had new jobs — Ms. Lachhman as a hospital operations manager and Mr. Parmassar in cybersecurity — and were eager to lock in a deal while they still could.\n\nAfter spending almost every weekend for three months looking at houses, the couple secured a two-bedroom, two-bathroom home with a pool, paying around $660,000, about $30,000 over asking price, at a 4 percent interest rate.\n\n“The way the housing market was during the pandemic, it gave millennials such as myself a very good opportunity to get into the housing market,” said Ms. Lachhman. “It would have been a much more difficult process now.”\n\nThe couple is still in the house and doing well on paper. Their monthly payment of about $5,000 hasn’t budged, leaving room for savings and entertainment. But life looks different. Now, the couple has a Labrador retriever, an 18-month-old and another baby on the way, and the house feels a lot smaller than it used to.\n\nIt’s a dilemma they share with many other Americans who purchased houses during the pandemic: financially grounded, yet physically stuck and unsure how to move forward.\n\nWhen the world shut down and mortgage rates tumbled, buying a home felt like the ultimate act of security. Americans rushed to buy, some pooling resources with siblings, partners or friends to make it possible. During the pandemic, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell below 3 percent for the first time, and hit a record low of 2.65 percent in early 2021, according to Freddie Mac. For many, that moment felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nThose who secured a rate below 3 percent found themselves “a rarity and something we might not see again for a very long time,” said Stephanie Williams, a senior wealth adviser at investment firm AlphaCore Wealth Advisory. And according to a 2023 Realtor.com and HarrisX survey, about 82 percent of homeowners said they felt “locked in” by their low mortgage rate, and more than half were waiting for conditions to improve before selling.\n\nA few years later, some of those pandemic buyers are caught between stability and a desire for change.\n\n“Many people bought their homes in the hopes it was an initial steppingstone on the path to a more ideal property; yet with higher interest rates and more limited inventory, that ‘starter home’ has become a long-term one,” said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Intuit Credit Karma. “It can leave people feeling trapped.”\n\nNearly one in four homeowners regret their purchase, according to a recent survey by Intuit Credit Karma, including 38 percent of millennials, who said they underestimated the costs of ownership, and another 40 percent who have postponed other life goals. Add in rising costs and life changes — new partners, children, breakups — and that stability can start to feel more like confinement.\n\nIn today’s high-rate, high-price market, many homeowners can’t justify trading their 3 percent mortgage for one that’s twice as expensive, said Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com. Yet, many homeowners who want a change aren’t sure whether to rent out their home, sell it or stay put. With President Trump’s recent proposal of a 50-year-mortgage as a way to make home buying more affordable, some feel pressure to keep their low-interest, 30-year mortgages.\n\nFor Amber McDorman and her husband, buying a home in the suburbs of Phoenix during the pandemic was a mix of luck and timing. They had started looking the year before, but listings came and went in the blink of an eye: One week they were outbid; the next, prices jumped beyond their budget.\n\nThen mortgage rates began dipping below 3 percent, and things started looking up. With a 2.5 percent interest rate, the McDormans secured a three-bedroom home for around $260,000 in 2020. Five years later, they’re still paying $1,300 a month, and their equity has soared by 65 percent.\n\nBack then, the home felt perfect for two people with one child. But they have added a second child to their family, and both work primarily from home, often sharing the same office. The couple would love more space but can’t bring themselves to trade their mortgage for today’s higher rates and home prices. Adding an extension for another bedroom or office could cost up to $50,000, Ms. McDorman said.\n\n“I honestly feel like we’re kind of the lucky ones,” said Ms. McDorman, a social worker in her late 30s. “But we didn’t intend for this to be our forever home.”\n\nLissette Debord and her husband decided to sell the starter home they purchased during the pandemic instead of staying in a place they’d outgrown. They bought the house in 2020 in Sussex County, N.J., when they were both 21, during Ms. Debord’s last semester of college, using money they saved by having a virtual wedding on Zoom to secure a 2.7 percent interest rate. The couple was able to afford the $250,000 two-bedroom home through a combination of personal savings, bank loans and first-time home buyer benefits.\n\nThe pandemic made them rethink their priorities.\n\n“Like, ‘Are we going to invest in one day, or are we going to invest in something that’s going to build our future?’” said Ms. Debord, who is now 26 and works as an analyst at an executive recruiting firm.\n\nLast year, with their first child, they moved into a larger home in Jefferson, N.J., gaining an extra bedroom and more space. The trade-off was steep: Their new mortgage is now more than double the old one, and has a 6.6 percent interest rate.\n\nNow, with another baby on the way, the higher payments have reshaped their lives. Ms. Debord and her family have had to cut back on outings and vacations, and must budget more carefully while managing child care and other household costs.\n\n“We took a chance,” Ms. Debord said. “It is what it is now.”\n\nJa’nise Johnson, 41, bought a four-bedroom home in Tampa, Fla., in 2019, securing an interest rate of around 3 percent. She had a job in insurance for seven years, but when the pandemic hit in 2020, she was furloughed, making it hard for her to keep up mortgage payments while raising three boys as a single mother.\n\nWithin the first year, she defaulted on her mortgage. She leaned heavily on friends and family and took side gigs like DoorDash to make ends meet. But she didn’t want to give up the home, wanting to maintain stability for her three children.\n\nLast year, because she was behind on payments, she had to refinance her mortgage for a higher rate of 5.3 percent. That increased her monthly payments to $2,800 from $1,700, limiting her financial flexibility and ability to move.\n\nYet Ms. Johnson’s biggest regret isn’t buying the home or staying in it when she couldn’t afford the costs: It is not buying a home sooner.\n\n“I probably would have owned my home by this time,” said Ms. Johnson, who now works as a project manager for a financial services company. “Now, I don’t know how long it’s going to take.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/world/europe/louvre-heist-suspect.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:53:32-05:00","title":"Friends Say a Suspect in the Louvre Heist Had Tried to Leave a Rough Past Behind","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abdoulaye N., a 39-year-old man from Aubervilliers, Paris, has been charged in one of France’s most high-profile art heists, where four suspects stole a valuable tiara from the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery.

2025-11-16T18:53:32-05:00\n\nAs far as his friends at the outdoor gym knew, the always cheerful 39-year-old man from a hardscrabble suburb of Paris had left his past behind. He no longer talked much about his years as a star of the city’s urban dirt bike subculture, a rider known as Doudou Cross Bitume who made his name doing wheelies up the Champs-Élysées.\n\nWhen asked why, his friends said, he told them he had since had children and didn’t want them associating him with that bad-boy image. Weaving in and out of traffic at high speeds on just one wheel in so-called urban rodeos was eventually deemed so dangerous, it was later made punishable by prison time.\n\nHe also did not talk about a criminal past.\n\nNow Abdoulaye N. has been charged in one of France’s highest-profile burglaries — accused of being one of the four men who made off with more than $100 million worth of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre.\n\n“I still can’t believe he’s involved in this,” said Medhy Camara, 35, a friend from the outdoor workout park who said that they grew up together and that he had always considered Abdoulaye an older brother. As his eyes filled with tears, he added: “I don’t understand now, but I have faith in the justice system. I tell myself, I will understand later.”\n\nTo be clear, Abdoulaye N. has not yet stood trial; he is only charged in the Louvre heist. But his arrest just days after the spectacular burglary is the talk of his gentrifying suburb of Aubervilliers, located at the end of the northern Parisien subway where decommissioned factories are being converted into artist studios. Some are even calling him the Lupin of Aubervilliers, after the fictional gentleman thief repopularized by the Netflix series starring Omar Sy.\n\nThe chief prosecutor has not released his name but has provided information about a 39-year-old accused of entering the Louvre for the heist. The 39-year-old, according to a court document in an unrelated case cited by the Louvre prosecutor, is named Abdoulaye N.\n\nThe other suspects have not been identified by the authorities, so their back stories are not yet known.\n\nAccording to Paris’s chief prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, two men broke into the Louvre’s gilded Apollo Gallery and used a disc grinder to crack open two bulletproof display cases, grabbing precious items, including a tiara worn by the country’s last empress, encrusted with 212 pearls and almost 3,000 diamonds.\n\nOnce back outside, the men sped off on two high-powered motor scooters with two accomplices, the authorities say. In their haste to leave, with the police less than a minute away, the suspects left behind many items. A glove. A motorcycle helmet. The truck with its mechanical ladder that had lifted two of the men to a second-floor window they broke open.\n\nMost important for the authorities, they also left behind the DNA that the prosecutor says led them to three of the four men accused of being directly responsible, including Abdoulaye N., who are now charged in the crime. One man remains at large, and the jewels have yet to be found.\n\nAbdoulaye N.’s DNA was already in France’s large database because of his criminal record, which includes 15 entries, two for theft, according to the chief prosecutor. Little information has been released, but in one case, in 2008, he rammed a car into an ATM. Then, in 2015, he was convicted of another theft.\n\nDuring a hearing for the two men accused of entering the Louvre, they made statements admitting to being involved in the theft but minimized their roles, according to Ms. Beccuau. The New York Times has reached out to Abdoulaye N.’s lawyers; after his arrest, one of them, Diala Al-Shaman, said in a text message that she had no comment.\n\nInterviews with several workout friends and a neighbor in recent days, plus details about the 39-year-old from the prosecutor, offer a basic sketch of Abdoulaye N.’s life up until now.\n\nHe was born and grew up in Aubervilliers, a suburb that is home to many immigrants and their descendants. It was there, in the northern outskirts of Paris, that he was raised in a large family by parents who had emigrated from West Africa, according to Mr. Camara.\n\nHe worked as a laborer in many different jobs, from delivery, to driving an unlicensed taxi to doing stints in construction, according to the chief prosecutor or people who knew him.\n\nFor years, his claim to fame was as an early “urban rodeo” rider. Videos captured his dangerous high-speed motocross tricks performed on busy highways, bike paths and streets around Greater Paris. He began posting them onto Dailymotion, a French version of YouTube, as early as 2007, gaining notoriety and the attention of rappers like Mac Tyer, who mentioned him in a song.\n\nHe called himself Doudou Cross Bitume — shorthand for urban motocross mixed with the diminutive nickname Doudou.\n\n“We consider him a legend in the community” because of how early he took to the practice and because of the risks he took, said the French urban motocross influencer Alan Henry, who goes by the moniker Weediful and whose YouTube channel has more than 630,000 subscribers.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Parisien was the first to report that Abdoulaye N. is the online persona Doudou Cross Bitume. The Times spoke with three of his workout buddies and a neighbor, who all confirmed Doudou Cross Bitume was Abdoulaye N.\n\nAnother of his lawyers, Maxime Cavaillé, said he would not “confirm or deny” the online persona was his client, explaining that he wanted to protect his privacy.\n\nIn more recent years, Abdoulaye N. posted videos of what appeared to be his new passion: working out at outdoor gyms. The postings showed him doing impressive tricks and feats of strength.\n\nHe is often smiling, wearing a bandanna knotted at his forehead. “There are things that happen in life,” he said in a video he posted in September, after he missed a flight because, he said, he was exercising. “Now I’m looking for a place to sleep at the airport. Cross Bitume missed the plane. Ay caramba.”\n\nAt an outdoor gym in southern Paris close to the Accor Arena, where Beyoncé and Lady Gaga have played, Abdoulaye N.’s workout friends remained in shock on a recent day at reports of his arrest.\n\nHe was a regular there at the collection of monkey bars and free weights under a copse of trees, where a group of men gather every evening to work out to music and film one another doing difficult routines.\n\nThey described him as kind and generous, often arriving to workouts with fresh fruit to share, as well as pastries and a birthday cake to celebrate one of the men’s birthdays. Then, he would leave to go take care of his children, they said.\n\nShenty Alexis, a professional athlete of the sport known as “street workout,” said he started training alongside Abdoulaye N. about a year ago. When he learned that his new friend was the famous urban rodeo rider he had watched in videos as a teenager two decades ago, he asked him why he’d never said anything about it.\n\n“He said to me, ‘Ah yes, but that was when I was young, you know,’” said Mr. Alexis, 35, who goes by the name he uses in competitions and exhibitions. “And I said to him, ‘Yeah, but wait, that’s you.’ He said, ‘Yes, but you see, now I have children, you see, I don’t really want them to associate me with that.’”\n\nThe last video Abdoulaye N. posted on his TikTok feed on Sept. 11 featured Mr. Alexis, a promoter of street workout who did demonstrations during the Paris Olympics two summers ago, doing acrobatic flips on outdoor bars. Seen more than a million times, the video has also been broadcast around the world with reports about the arrests in the Louvre heists but does not make clear that Mr. Alexis is not a suspect. As a result, Mr. Alexis has since been stopped by strangers on the street, accusing him of being a thief and asking him where the jewels were hidden, he said.\n\nSome people online have spewed racist comments about him. He has hired a lawyer to go after media companies broadcasting his image, he said in an interview, and he filed a police complaint for defamation.\n\n“He’s really the last guy I would have thought of for something like that,” he said of Abdoulaye N. and the heist. “Maybe he had money problems or something, I don’t know.”\n\nSégolène Le Stradic and Ana Castelain contributed reporting from Paris.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/style/jeans-carter-anderson-indigo-invitational.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"17:44:40-05:00","title":"His Jeans Are Gigantic.

Are Gigantic. His Internet Fame Is Too.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T17:44:40-05:00\n\nCarter Anderson is not nine feet tall. But his jeans are.\n\nEvery day for the past two and a half months, Mr. Anderson, 27, a building engineer from Portland, Ore., has worn a pair of gargantuan jeans from the Canadian jeans brand Naked & Famous Denim. The jeans, with a 100-inch inseam, are about the length of a full-size alligator or a brag-worthy Christmas tree. When unfurled, their legs look like the arms of the inflatable tube men that sit outside car dealerships.\n\n“This is kind of my hobby right now,” said Mr. Anderson, who was visiting New York this month.\n\nHe is part of the “raw denim community,” a cohort of men (and it is almost entirely men) who treat wearing jeans not just as a daily necessity, but as an act of cotton-based metamorphosis bordering on fetish. For the uninformed, “raw denim” is denim in its inkiest, unwashed form. Through wear it fades, whiskers and puckers in idiosyncratic ways.\n\n“You start off with a blank slate basically, and, through all of the weathering, you end up with a one-of-a-kind form,” Mr. Anderson said.\n\nMen like him take wearing jeans to extremes, such that the community has started its own Olympic-like contest: the Indigo Invitational, an online “raw denim fading competition” that is in its fifth year. Mr. Anderson purchased his elephantine jeans specifically for this contest a year and a half ago.\n\n“They’ve been lying under my bed,” said Mr. Anderson, who custom-ordered the jeans for around $400.\n\nFor the contest, Mr. Anderson is required to wear these jeans every day (it’s an honor system) and photograph their wear progress each month. To do so, he strings up the jeans, horizontally, in his house, using some 20 clip hangers. The jeans will be judged for their wear and whiskers by a panel of denim experts next September. Prizes include (what else?) free jeans.\n\nHis thinking was: the longer the jeans, the greater the fades. And after just two months, the original inky indigo shade had given way to a lighter oxford blue. Mr. Anderson mostly wears them bunched up, so the legs look like a stack of crushed Coke cans.\n\nWhat surprised Mr. Anderson, though, is that he has found a broader audience on TikTok, picking up robust interest with videos of him doing various activities in the jeans: swimming, rock climbing, golfing, visiting a trampoline park. Some of the videos have hit hundreds of thousands of views, and he has now challenged himself to explore newer, weirder activities to do in the jeans.\n\n“Realistically, people don’t care about denim,” Mr. Anderson said. “They care about the world’s longest blank.” (He titles his videos “World’s Longest Jeans,” for shorthand, though he’s aware that he’s about 241 feet short of the Guinness World record-holder for longest jeans, which is held by a Chinese textile company.)\n\nIn an interview that has been edited and condensed for clarity, he discusses his decision to commit to the bit, his least favorite activity to do in the jeans and what he will do with them when the year is up.\n\nLet’s start with the basics: How long did it take to put them on the first time?\n\nFive minutes.\n\nAnd what’s that time down to now?\n\nMaybe one or two minutes. When you wear them every day, you start to understand the physics of them.\n\nHow often do you wash them?\n\nI swam in them once and washed them once. I’ll wash them once I get back home. Dragging them around unfurled in New York is definitely a sanitation concern. I wash them inside out.\n\nDo you wear them to work?\n\nI work in a professional environment, so I can’t wear them to work. But I put them on every day for at least a little bit just to keep it going. I’ve got do it, man. It’s a responsibility.\n\nHave you slept in the jeans?\n\nI have not. I’ve thought about it.\n\nIs there anything you won’t do in the jeans?\n\nI’m not going to wear them to a funeral. I’m not crazy.\n\nOn TikTok, people always comment with new ideas of things for you to do in the jeans. What was your least favorite activity?\n\nI went to a trampoline park recently, and I’m having to talk to the staff and explain that I’m not a creep as I’m, like, waiting for gaps in children to film. So, the hardest part is explaining it to people. But people like the jeans. People like a combination of novelty and familiarity. And I think this strikes that.\n\nWhat’s your next activity in the jeans?\n\nI had no plans to go indoor skydiving, but now I’m trying to get that hammered out. I’m pretty introverted — I like hanging out in my house — but this quest is getting out of my element, trying stuff I wouldn’t normally try.\n\nWhen you swam in them, how did you not sink?\n\nI had pool floaties in the legs, so there was no drowning risk.\n\nHow often do you really unfurl them and walk around?\n\nThat’s just for the videos. I was going to walk the entirety of the Brooklyn Bridge with them unfurled. But it was packed. I did not intend to be an influencer, so there’s a level of obnoxiousness that I’m just not willing to cross.\n\nWhen you do wear them unfurled, aren’t you worried they’ll spring a hole? Your feet are basically scraping against the ground.\n\nIt’s all about thrashing them. I’m not worried about damaging them. I’m kind of looking forward to getting holes at some level because that will enable me to do more things. Like one thing that’s been suggested a lot is roller skating, and I can’t wear roller skates with them unfurled until there’s a hole where my feet are.\n\nWhat will you do with them when this is over?\n\nProbably hang them up in my house.\n\nOK, the important question. Do you think you’ll win the contest?\n\nI might not win, but the love is in the journey.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/james-watson-dna.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"09:00:04-05:00","title":"James Watson Saw the True Form of DNA.

Then It Blinded Him.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T09:00:04-05:00\n\nAt first, James Watson terrified me. It was 1991 and my first day as the new science writer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. My boss’s boss was Dr. Watson, the venerable scientist who codiscovered the double helix form of DNA. He greeted me as though he had just remembered that I was supposed to tell him something, “Oh! Nate … ” He looked me in the eye, shook my hand, then stared just over my head, as if checking whether someone more interesting was coming in.\n\nI worked at Cold Spring Harbor for four years. Although I never became close to Dr. Watson, my fear of him abated, mostly. I saw that when he was not performing a public role, he was generally soft-spoken and thoughtful, if stubborn. He had an unnerving habit of answering my questions with a seeming non sequitur. I’d look baffled, he’d fidget and I would at last understand that his response was three steps downfield from where my mind’s eye had been looking.\n\nNear the end of my time at Cold Spring Harbor, I remember seeing Dr. Watson walking around the campus, brandishing a copy of Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein’s new book “The Bell Curve,” which notoriously argued that I.Q. differences between racial groups are genetic. At the time, I don’t recall race having been something Dr. Watson talked about in public (nor had I heard him speak of it in private). That changed drastically after the turn of the century. Jim being Jim, the more the public pressed him not to say those things, the more he said them. It was perverse but predictable. Eventually, his dogged insistence on a connection between race and intelligence cost him his reputation as a scientist and his relationship with his beloved Cold Spring Harbor, one of the great loves of his life.\n\nDNA giveth and DNA taketh away. Dr. Watson, who died on Nov. 6, had built his stratospheric career on his total commitment to DNA and molecular biology, which resulted in a Nobel Prize and leadership of the Human Genome Project. DNA made him one of the most significant scientists of the 20th century. But getting carried away with it, insisting against the science and history that it was meaningful to compare I.Q. between races, made him among the most infamous of the 21st.\n\nGenetic determinism is one of those one-single-technofix-will-solve-everything ideas that visionaries can fall prey to, and the history of genetics is lousy with hereditarians promising to end disease, make us smarter and better our society. We’re drawn to magic bullet solutions that cannot solve complex social problems. It is all too easy for someone who makes a genuinely profound discovery to think they have found the secret of life, or the environment, or disease.\n\nIronically, Dr. Watson’s preoccupation with genetic determinism was far from predetermined. Some of his contemporaries began entertaining eugenics ideas in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and called for deeper studies into claims that I.Q. measured human intelligence and varied across different races. But Dr. Watson stayed out of this eugenics boomlet, even after becoming director of Cold Spring Harbor in 1968.\n\nSo what changed? Why did he later become receptive to ideas he had once found repugnant?\n\nRecombinant DNA happened. DNA sequencing happened. The Human Genome Project happened. Like scientists before him, Dr. Watson got carried away by a pretty but simplistic model of the gene that seemed able to explain everything. He had been interested in the gene all his adult life. But by the time he became head of the Human Genome Project, he identified with it. Through the 1980s and ’90s, DNA motifs were incorporated into the fabric of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory — from outdoor sculpture to a 65-foot-tall bell tower.\n\nDNA also became personal. When his older son developed mental illness, Dr. Watson would repeatedly say that he found comfort in the idea that his son merely got a bad roll of the “genetic dice.” Dr. Watson shared this notion with many other families living with genetic illness. On some level, if something is “in your genes,” you’re absolved, it’s not your fault. In this way, genetic determinism is like astrology. Indeed, Dr. Watson himself once said: “We used to think our fate was in our stars. Now we know, in large measure, our fate is in our genes.”\n\nAn obsession with the gene, of course, is not a complete explanation for why racist ideas resonated with Dr. Watson — who was bourgeois, Anglophiliac and Eurocentric, proudly elitist and rather fond of the mid-1950s patriarchy. For “The Bell Curve” to strike such a chord, some part of him had to already be receptive to its arguments.\n\nAn overweening faith that our genes make us who we are is a terrifying thing. If you think there is one single fundamental essence that makes you you more than anything else, you’re at risk. Though genetic determinism doesn’t necessarily make you a racist, it might move you to support forced sterilization, found a Nobel Prize winner sperm bank, have 17 children or commit other eugenic acts. Exactly what form it takes in any one case depends on culture, family, temperament — even, a little, your genes.\n\nNathaniel Comfort is a professor of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University and a fellow of the Center for Science, Technology, Medicine and Society at the University of California, Berkeley.

2025-11-15T20:29:53-05:00\n\nA detailed account of how 28 people died in the flooding at Camp Mystic.\n\nBy J. David Goodman, Malika Khurana, Bora Erden, Marco Hernandez, Yuhan Liu, Karthik Patanjali, Bedel Saget and Charlie Smart\n\nSource: Flooding data from First Street. 3-D model of camp based on LiDAR data captured by The Times on Nov. 12.\n\nAcross Camp Mystic on the night of July 3, 195 campers settled into their bunks. Taps played over a loudspeaker shortly after 10 p.m. Dick Eastland, the 70-year-old patriarch of the family-run all girls camp, was at home in his creek-side house on the camp property, not far from the cabins.\n\nSo too was Edward Eastland, one of his sons. Edward grew up at Camp Mystic and now directs the camp along with his wife Mary Liz, living in a house even closer to the cabins and the Guadalupe River than his father.\n\nHeavy rain was in the forecast, and camp staffers had already pulled from the water the largest boats — 20-foot-long “war canoes” — as they always did before a big rain in the flood-prone area.\n\nWhat follows is the most detailed description to date of the events that took the lives of more than two dozen campers and counselors, and the elder Mr. Eastland, at the 99-year-old summer retreat.\n\nThe descriptions and rendering of those events were taken from the first interviews that Camp Mystic’s owners have granted, along with never-before-seen videos and photos taken during flooding at the camp, data from devices such as Apple watches, cell phones and vehicle crash data, and court documents from a lawsuit filed by some of the parents of children who died.\n\nThe Times visualized the water levels at the camp over the course of the night using videos and photos from the camp and estimates from a flood simulation by First Street, a nonprofit that assesses flood risk in the United States. The moving dots on the diagrams in this story show the simulated flow and depth of water at different times, and the extent of flooding.\n\nAt 1:14 a.m. on July 4, the National Weather Service warned of potentially life-threatening flooding in the area. By that point, according to data from his phone, Dick Eastland was already up and monitoring the weather.\n\nAround 1:45 a.m., he radioed his son, Edward. “His words were that we’ve gotten about two inches of rain in the last hour and that we need to move the waterfront equipment,” Edward Eastland told The New York Times, his first time recounting his story publicly. Members of the grounds crew went to the waterfront and pulled the remaining smaller canoes to higher ground on the hill nearer to the cabins. No one expected the water to rise that high, Edward Eastland said.\n\nHe drove to the camp office where his father and the night watchman, Glenn Juenke, were monitoring the weather. The elder Mr. Eastland checked the rain gauge that he kept at his house. A group of workers had just returned to the camp from a day off, describing a harrowing drive in the pouring rain.\n\nStanding outside the office, Mr. Juenke filmed a creek, usually dry, that was strongly flowing nearby.\n\n“Bubble Gum Creek is bad,” Edward Eastland texted his wife, at 2:21 a.m. “Look at the radar.” A severe thunderstorm hovered over the camp, he recalled in the interview. “Looks short tho,” she texted back, believing the heaviest rain would soon pass. “It kept saying that it would end in 30 minutes,” he recalled.\n\nAround that time, two counselors from Bug House — a cabin of 12-year-olds closest to the river — came to the office to report water running down a steep hill into their cabin door. Edward and his father drove them back, and tried to reassure them. “At that point,” he recalled, “it was a normal flood.”\n\nA little before 3 a.m., Edward said, a call came over the radio from a staff member in the gatehouse at the camp entrance, right along the river. “She said there’s water coming in her cabin,” he said. “She couldn't get the door open.” Then her radio made some “very strange noises.” He could not reach her again. (The gatehouse cabin was eventually swept away in the flood; the woman survived by clinging to a tree.)\n\nAt about that time, Mr. Eastland said his father radioed from Bug House where the river was rising. “My dad said, we need to get Bug House out,” he recalled.\n\nThe evacuation began, he said. Mr. Eastland, his father and Mr. Juenke loaded campers into each of their vehicles — two pickups and an S.U.V. — in two trips, bringing campers to the main office and directing them to walk the short distance to the recreation hall.\n\nCounselors in a cabin further up the road, Nut Hut, watched as the evacuation took place.\n\nThe camp’s one-page safety plan, reviewed by The Times, called for them to shelter in place in a flood.\n\nDuring the evacuation on July 4, the counselors were told “by the camp” not to leave their cabins, according to a lawsuit filed against Mystic. But as the water rose, the Nut Hut counselors evacuated themselves and their campers, climbing a steep hill behind their cabin.\n\nEdward Eastland denied directing anyone to stay put during the evacuation. “When Jumble House asked me if they should walk, I said, ‘yes, go,’” he recalled, referring to another cabin.\n\nIn all, counselors in two cabins eventually evacuated on their own, climbing up the hill with their campers. Mr. Juenke helped those in a third cabin reach the hill, and then sent them up.\n\nThe water kept rising. A counselor photographed the girls walking to the recreation hall at 3:26 a.m.\n\n“On the second trip, the water was running over the road. It was probably ankle deep,” Edward Eastland said. By then, water covered the sloping grass between the cabins and the river. Lightning crashed, revealing canoes floating over the soccer field.\n\nSoon it was up to the top of his truck tires, he said.\n\nAt that point, Mr. Eastland and his father turned to the cabins of the youngest campers, Bubble Inn and Twins. A video, taken at 3:26 a.m. by one of the workers from a second-floor sleeping area above the commissary, captured deepening water swiftly moving past Twins, while, in the distance, campers were still able to wade through ankle and knee-deep water into the rec hall.\n\nVideos showing the Recreation hall and the Twins cabin.\n\nMr. Juenke ended up in a cabin called Wiggle Inn, where he would ride out the rising water, with the campers and two counselors floating on inflatable mattresses. “We’re going to be OK,” Mr. Juenke recalled telling them.\n\nDick Eastland parked his S.U.V. by the entrance to Bubble Inn. “He was standing outside of his Tahoe, and the water was rushing all around these cabins at this point, it was probably two or three feet,” his son said. “That’s the last place I saw him.”\n\nEdward Eastland walked around Giggle Box and through waist-high water to the pair of connected cabins known as Twins.\n\n“It feels like rapids at that point,” he said. He saw two counselors calling out for help from the porch. As he got to the cabin, he said he thought to himself, “we cannot get these eight-year-olds out of this cabin in this water.”\n\nVideos appear to show that the water rose about five feet in 24 minutes.\n\nWater, he said, had never reached the cabin, not in 100 years. “It was unbelievable,” Edward Eastland recalled.\n\nInside the first Twins cabin, a dozen 8-year-old girls huddled in the corner together on top of two bunk beds.\n\n“I tell them, I'm here and I'm not leaving you guys, and everything's gonna be OK,” he said. The 11 girls in the second Twins cabin were also on the top bunks. The water at that point was rushing by the doorways and filling both cabins.\n\n“Water started coming in through the window,” he said. “I yelled to the counselors, does anybody have a screwdriver?” Edward Eastland was thinking of trying to remove a metal vent in the low ceiling to climb through. As he moved between cabins, the counselors were yelling that the water was chest high.\n\n“I remember seeing the waterline and just praying that it would stop going up,” he said. “And it just kept going up.”\n\nMr. Eastland said he was able to talk to his father on the radio, and he heard him struggling in the water.\n\n“He said, ‘I need help. I can't move,’” Mr. Eastland recalled. “I said, I can’t.”\n\nDick Eastland appeared to have been trying to get the eight-year-old girls out of Bubble Inn and into his Tahoe. It was not clear if he loaded all 13 campers and two counselors inside.\n\n“He was right there,” Mr. Eastland recalled, standing outside the Twins cabins on a recent sunny morning, with Bubble Inn just a few steps away. But from inside the cabin that night, Mr. Eastland said he could not see him.\n\nThen his father’s radio seemed to malfunction, Mr. Eastland said.\n\nThe water picked up Dick Eastland’s S.U.V., carrying it forcefully over the soccer field, down past the archery range and into a grove by the river, smashing the vehicle against a tall Cypress.\n\nA data report from his vehicle, reviewed by The Times, indicated a crash at 3:51 a.m. His Apple watch showed he went underwater at the same time. He was found dead in the S.U.V., along with three campers from Bubble Inn.\n\nAround that time, Mr. Eastland said he was in the second Twins cabin, the water at his shoulders, when a counselor yelled from the other Twins cabin that the water was carrying girls out the door.\n\n“I'm right here in the doorway, and three girls come out of that door,” Mr. Eastland recalled, his voice shaking. “I catch two of them, and one girl gets away into the darkness.”\n\nAs he held the two girls, and gripped the doorway, the water began to rise over his head. Another camper swept from the cabin behind him grabbed onto him.\n\n“I have no idea who it was,” he said. “She put her arms around my neck” and tried to hold on.\n\nThen, he said, the water pushed him and the girls holding onto him from the cabin into the surging river.\n\nData from his Apple watch, reviewed by The Times, indicated that Mr. Eastland went underwater at 4:09 a.m.\n\nHe struggled against the current. “I could feel the pressure, like I was almost to the top,” he said, but the surface, “it just, it wasn't there.”\n\nThe flow of the water carried Mr. Eastland alone past a row of trees along the road where an hour before he had been evacuating campers. Now the water reached the branches, which he tried to seize. But, he said, they kept breaking.\n\nEventually the water pushed him into the canopy of a pair of large trees, just below the Bug House cabin. He grabbed on.\n\nSeveral campers and counselors from the Twins cabins were already there, clinging for their lives, Mr. Eastland said. Eight campers and three counselors survived by holding on to the same trees, he said. Another counselor survived in a tree along the road, and another camper also was found alive nearby, he said. Three more campers were later found alive down river.\n\nThe scale of the loss became clear only after the water receded, Mr. Eastland said.\n\nEleven campers from the two Twins cabins died in the flood. All 13 campers and both counselors who were in Bubble Inn died. Another girl was swept away after trying to return to her cabin, Jumble House, for a blanket after evacuating.\n\nThe body of one girl from Twins, Cile Steward, 8, has still not been found.\n\nThe waterlines in the cabins, measured by The Times, rose well above the heads of the campers.\n\nThe concrete-block base of one wall was pushed in by the floodwater.\n\nIn one of the Twins cabins, the lines appeared to reach the low, flat ceiling. In the other, the water stopped a few inches from the ceiling.\n\nResidue on the wall shows that the water rose to just six inches below the ceiling.\n\nNone of the buildings at the camp, except for the gatehouse and a wing of the commissary used for storage, were destroyed, though many were damaged. In Bubble Inn, the waterline was 6 feet 3 inches from the floor.\n\nThe riverwaters eventually surrounded and filled the first floor of the open, two-story recreation hall, where 95 campers and 15 counselors had gathered for safety, according to figures provided by Camp Mystic. They huddled on the narrow second-floor balcony that wrapped around the log-frame structure, watching beneath them the water flow through the building.\n\nThe relatives of some of the 25 campers and two counselors who died have filed lawsuits against the camp and the Eastland family, arguing that the camp had been negligent in advance of the flood and that the last-minute rescue efforts were undertaken too late.\n\n“The Camp chose not to evacuate its campers and counselors, even as floodwater reached the cabins, until counselors demanded it,” according to one of the suits. “When it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster.”\n\nIn interviews with The Times, Mr. Eastland and his brother Richard, who also works and lives at the camp, said that based on decades of experience living at the camp and running it through previous floods, they believed the cabins were the safest place for the campers.\n\n“In our minds, the cabins were built on high ground,” Richard Eastland said.\n\nThe family felt that way even after a 2011 FEMA map placed most of the cabins, including Bubble Inn and Twins, within a 100-year flood zone. The camp hired surveyors who argued there were errors in the topography used for that map; the federal agency in 2013 removed the cabins from the floodplain maps.\n\nBut the July 4 flood had changed what high ground was for the camp, Richard Eastland said.\n\nThere had been no plan for how to evacuate campers, the Eastlands said. The evacuation was improvised, as the water level rose more rapidly than they had ever seen. The camp is planning to create an evacuation plan for the future, Richard Eastland said.\n\nAnd, the Eastlands said, the camp will never again use the cabins that flooded to house campers or counselors.\n\nBut next summer they plan to reopen their separate, adjacent camp – Camp Mystic Cypress Lake – that sits higher up a hill and did not flood that holiday weekend.\n\nSome families have welcomed the news, while others, including those whose children died in the flood and the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, have criticized the camp for its decision. The Texas Legislature is planning to hold hearings on what took place at the camp though a date has not yet been announced.\n\nEdward Eastland said he has been going to counseling. He has returned many times to the spot where his father died along with several girls from Bubble Inn, at the base of a Cypress tree, by the now-gently flowing river.\n\n“Every morning is horrible,” he said, his voice quavering. “I want to help the families. I don't know what to do though.”\n\n“We are so sorry,” said his wife, Mary Liz. “I feel like no one thinks that we're sorry.”\n\nTimes’ journalists generated the 3-D model of Camp Mystic from high-resolution LiDAR data captured by The Times using a drone flown over the camp on Nov. 12. The flood simulation provided by First Street models water levels at the camp over the course of the night, based on rain on the night of the flood and topography in the area. Photos and videos from the camp point to water levels even higher than the simulation’s estimate.\n\nRuth Graham and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

Moment\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T05:00:28-05:00\n\nEntering Cindy Eckert’s home quickly makes clear that the whole pink thing was never the gimmick her haters once made it out to be.\n\nGracing the entryway is an oversize pink statue of her French bulldog, Mortimer. In the interior courtyard, a glass-enclosed garage showcases a pink-wrapped 1940s Chevy truck. A pink metal staircase leads to a room filled with rack after rack of Ms. Eckert’s pink feathered-and-frilled wardrobe. Even the coop out back, occupied by a small flock of chickens and two overgrown pigs, is dedicated to Ms. Eckert’s signature hue. She calls it the Pink Poultry Club.\n\nThen there is Ms. Eckert herself, who, on an October day in Raleigh, N.C., was dressed, as ever, in pink from the tip of her rose-lacquered toes to the top of her magenta-streaked head. “I was recently at a conference, and a woman that I love said, ‘Oh, we’re still doing pink,’” said Ms. Eckert, 52. “I said, ‘Just still doing me.’”\n\nMs. Eckert is the co-founder and chief executive of Sprout Pharmaceuticals, the maker of the women’s libido drug Addyi, which treats the condition known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or H.S.D.D., in premenopausal women. Sometimes erroneously referred to as “female Viagra” — Addyi targets neurotransmitters, not blood flow — its proper name is flibanserin, and in 2015, Ms. Eckert won a knock-down, drag-out battle to get it approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nNaturally, she has embraced the name “little pink pill.”\n\nIn Ms. Eckert’s fight with the government agency, critics accused Sprout of trying to medicalize the natural ebbs and flows of women’s sexual desire. They also saw Ms. Eckert’s colorful style as a sleight of hand to distract from the scientific debates about her product. When, one day after winning F.D.A. approval, Ms. Eckert sold Sprout for $1 billion to a company that soon hiked the price and effectively shelved Addyi, it was all the more proof for her detractors that she didn’t have patients’ best interest at heart.\n\nBut a decade later, after winning back her company in a 2018 legal battle, Ms. Eckert’s critics have quieted. Some have even been converted.\n\n“My mind has been changed,” said Laurie Mintz, a psychologist and sex therapist, who once argued that likening low libido to a disease could drive women away from “less dangerous” remedies.\n\nThanks to the loosening of F.D.A. guidelines surrounding Addyi and a wider, ongoing reckoning with women’s health care, there are now more than 30,000 doctors prescribing Addyi and more than half a million prescriptions on the market. As women binge-read copies of Miranda July’s best seller about a perimenopausal mother’s sexual awakening, or devour stories about Gen X women having the best sex ever, women of all ages are prioritizing their own sex lives. And Ms. Eckert’s drug — and other treatments for women struggling with their libido — are reaping the benefits.\n\n“We played the long game,” Ms. Eckert said. “Culture caught up.”\n\nFor much of the last half-century, the fight for women’s sexual freedom has hinged largely on economic arguments. Giving women access to birth control, advocates’ reasoning went, would allow them to determine if and when they had children, empowering them to study, to work and to attain financial independence.\n\nWhether women actually desired or enjoyed the sex they were now free to have was, for a long time, a far more taboo question — one that even their doctors weren’t trained to ask.\n\nIt was on Ms. Eckert’s mind, though, when she ran into the urologist Dr. Irwin Goldstein at a sexual medicine conference in 2010. She was attending on behalf of another company she co-founded with her then-husband, Bob Whitehead, which sold testosterone pellets. Dr. Goldstein had something he wanted Ms. Eckert to see.\n\nIt was a series of videos from women who had been part of a clinical trial for flibanserin. A German company was studying the drug for treatment of H.S.D.D., but the F.D.A. had rejected it, and now the company was giving up on the trials. The women in the videos were distraught that they would no longer have access to a treatment they said helped them.\n\nDr. Goldstein, who led clinical trials for Viagra, wanted Ms. Eckert to take up the cause. The timing was apt: At the same conference, a research cohort was presenting the results of a study that demonstrated the difference in brain activity between women with H.S.D.D. and women without it. Ms. Eckert was indignant that, for so long, women’s sexual desire had been dismissed purely as a matter of stress levels and marital woes.\n\nOne year after the conference, Ms. Eckert and Mr. Whitehead acquired the rights to flibanserin and founded Sprout, hoping to take another crack at approval.\n\nThat turned out not to be so easy. Clinical trials showed flibanserin slightly increased women’s sexual desire and activity and lowered their distress, compared with placebos, but it also made them drowsy and lowered their blood pressure, particularly when mixed with alcohol. The side effects gave F.D.A. officials pause, and the agency rejected Sprout’s application for approval for the drug, too.\n\nTo be turned down twice by the F.D.A. is typically a death sentence for new drugs. But for flibanserin, the decision had the opposite effect: It galvanized a movement of women who believed the rejection reeked of sexism.\n\nShortly after the F.D.A. denial, the feminist activist Susan Scanlan started a new and noisy advocacy group focused on flibanserin’s approval called Even the Score. The group, which received partial funding from Sprout, included dozens of women’s groups, consumer organizations and medical societies. Ms. Eckert, though, became perhaps its most visible champion, her wardrobe growing pinker by the day.\n\nSally Greenberg, chief executive of the National Consumers League, said she joined the group after attending a meeting with Dr. Goldstein, the urologist, and his patients. She believed there was a double standard in how regulators treated the well-known risks associated with drugs for men’s sexual dysfunction.\n\n“Because sex is so important for men to have, we’re willing to take a chance — but women can’t be trusted,” she said. (The F.D.A., which did not comment for this article, denied the claims of sexism at the time.)\n\nBut as support for the drug swelled, so did the backlash. Some accused Even the Score’s leadership of being bought off by Sprout. Other feminist and medical organizations charged the group with crying sexism where none existed and argued that Even the Score was another example of the creeping influence of pharmaceutical money at the F.D.A.\n\nMs. Eckert is still sensitive about Sprout’s financial ties to Even the Score. According to the company, Sprout spent $25,000 helping produce one ad campaign and a few thousand more flying in three women to speak at an F.D.A. advisory meeting, financing all of the women publicly disclosed. Still, Ms. Eckert bristles at the insinuation that the outrage was manufactured.\n\n“When they were treated like, ‘Oh, you’re just doing Cindy’s bidding for her,’ I’m thinking, ‘Man, you’ve never met these women,’” Ms. Eckert said.\n\nThe F.D.A. approved flibanserin in 2015, writing later in the New England Journal of Medicine that while “the average treatment effects were small” (about 10 percent higher than placebo) “efficacy had been established.”\n\nBut the wait for the drug was far from over. Regulators imposed strict guardrails, including a boxed warning on Addyi’s label. The F.D.A. also required doctors and pharmacists to get special certification to prescribe and dispense it, and women to sign a waiver promising to abstain from alcohol while taking it.\n\nThen, within a year, Valeant, the company that acquired Sprout, effectively imploded, causing the entire Sprout team in Raleigh to be wiped out in a move so swift there was rotting food left in the refrigerator. Ms. Eckert had initially viewed the sale as an “entrepreneur’s dream.” In the hands of a bigger company, she believed Addyi would get out to the market faster than if Sprout had tried to commercialize it on its own. (The $1 billion price tag certainly didn’t hurt.)\n\nWhen her plan fell apart, “it was really the feeling of just having let everybody down,” she said.\n\nThat feeling, though, was also a powerful motivator. In 2016, Sprout’s former investors sued Valeant for failing to meet their contractual obligation to market Addyi. Two years later, Valeant made a deal, handing the keys to the company back to Ms. Eckert in exchange for 6 percent of the royalties, with an added bonus: a $25 million loan to help her bring Addyi back from the dead.\n\nToday, Sprout 2.0, as Ms. Eckert calls it, operates out of an unremarkable office building and shopping complex about four miles from Ms. Eckert’s home. The team is small enough to fit around one big table for daily lunches and has a family feel, owing in part to the fact that some of them actually are Ms. Eckert’s family. Her older brother, Brian, is chief strategy officer. Justin Miller, Ms. Eckert’s fiancé, is Sprout’s chief operating officer. Even her ex-husband and co-founder, Mr. Whitehead, now chairs Sprout’s board.\n\nThe other employees inside this “unapologetically pink” office — as it says on the walls — are 20-or-so designers, marketers, supply chain specialists and one customer service agent with a particularly spicy inbox.\n\nTheir jobs are a bit different this time around. In the last few years, menopause and perimenopause have become, well, hot topics, and Silicon Valley investors and celebrities alike are contributing to a booming menopause economy.\n\nAt the same time, telehealth sites like Hims and Hers have wallpapered the world with ads about sexual enhancement treatments, chipping away at the stigma that has dogged the field for decades.\n\nAll of it has recently given Ms. Eckert’s company a boost. This year, Sprout is on track to double its revenue, and it is finding celebrity supporters along the way. In an ad for her podcast, the actress Jennie Garth shared that she was personally on the drug, and raved about how it had helped her. Gwyneth Paltrow, whose brand Goop sells its own libido supplement for women, wrote about Addyi earlier this year.\n\nThis weekend, Ms. Eckert is also the subject of a new documentary about the F.D.A. fight called “The Pink Pill,” premiering at the DOC NYC film festival. “This is a conversation that people have been desperate to have for such a long time,” said Aisling Chin-Yee, the film’s director.\n\nThis cultural shift has mirrored a regulatory one. Since Ms. Eckert won back Sprout, the F.D.A. has walked back many of its constraints on Addyi, removing the certification requirements on doctors and pharmacists and lifting the total restriction on alcohol intake for women.\n\nNow, Addyi’s label recommends that women — who are supposed to take the pill daily at bedtime — wait two hours after drinking or skip it entirely if they’ve had three or more drinks. This summer, the F.D.A. also fast-tracked Addyi’s application to expand approval for postmenopausal women. A final decision could come as early as this year.\n\nThese changes have made Addyi far more accessible to patients, said Dr. Rachel Rubin, a urologist and sexual medicine specialist, who used to lecture other clinicians on prescribing the drug and said she’s seen no major adverse events in her practice. “We’ve had years of experience with this medication,” Dr. Rubin said. “It’s just not scary.”\n\nThere are still plenty of women for whom it doesn’t work and who do require the therapeutic interventions that Dr. Mintz, the sex therapist who was once an Addyi critic, and others have long practiced. But for some women, Dr. Mintz has since found, Addyi “really is helpful, and I don’t think it should be dismissed.”\n\nSome of Addyi’s skeptics remain as unconvinced as ever. In 2016, Dr. Steven Woloshin, a professor at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine who specializes in medical communication, wrote in a medical journal that the F.D.A. “approved a marginally effective drug for a non-life-threatening condition in the face of substantial — and unnecessary — uncertainty about its dangers.”\n\nHe stands by that, pointing to Addyi’s limited benefits over placebos. “There’s lots of things that can affect sexual desire, and the way to help people isn’t necessarily to give this particular chemical,” Dr. Woloshin said.\n\nAddyi and Ms. Eckert have also occasionally drawn the ire of regulators. Shortly after she reintroduced her business, the F.D.A. sent Ms. Eckert a warning letter over a radio ad that failed to disclose all of Addyi’s risk factors. In May, it sent Ms. Eckert another, accusing her of doing much the same thing when she shared a People magazine article about Addyi on Instagram.\n\nAs of this week, she still hadn’t taken the post down.\n\nMs. Eckert is now working on another public pressure campaign, this time to expose what she says is a lack of parity in the way insurers cover drugs targeting women’s health conditions versus men’s. The idea was born during a recent salon Ms. Eckert attended at Gloria Steinem’s home.\n\nAs Addyi’s profile has grown, of course, so has the interest from potential acquirers. “We get offers,” Ms. Eckert said, and she isn’t ruling them out. But she’s a lot more hesitant to walk away. “This would be a really hard time, when we finally hit our stride, to ever give it up,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/business/italian-pasta-tariffs-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"05:00:49-05:00","title":"Pasta at Twice the Price?

Some Italian Producers Face Huge U.S. Tariffs.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T05:00:49-05:00\n\nEach day, as many as 20 trucks of semolina arrive at Garofalo, one of Italy’s largest pasta exporters. The ground durum wheat can come from anywhere in the world, but every other step in the process must happen in Gragnano, a town outside Naples where Garofalo is based.\n\nIn the humid and deafeningly loud factory, the wheat is mixed with spring water from the nearby Lattari Mountains, and the dough is pressed through bronze-edged molds. The bronze gives the pasta a distinctive rough texture that allows sauce to cling to it better, the mark of high quality.\n\nIt’s a process dictated by the local traditions that have earned Gragnano its reputation as the European capital of pasta and won it admirers from around the world.\n\nA substantial amount of the pasta made by Garofalo is destined for American kitchens, which make up about a fifth of the company’s sales. But that could end next year.\n\nGarofalo and a dozen other Italian producers are facing tariffs of more than 100 percent on their exports to the United States, which could make their pasta prohibitively expensive.\n\n“It’s shocking,” said Massimo Menna, the chief executive of Garofalo.\n\nThe companies have been accused of selling their products in the United States at artificially low prices and not cooperating with an investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Their penalty could be a 91.74 percent anti-dumping duty.\n\nFor the companies, the investigation was a bewildering decision.\n\nSomething has gone “completely wrong,” Mr. Menna said. He does not believe the Trump administration intends to “not let American consumers buy very good Italian products,” he added. “Because at 90 percent, it would not be possible.”\n\nA Trump administration official blamed the companies for failing to respond properly to the Commerce Department’s inquiry. “Italian pasta makers repeatedly screwed up a simple data request for a routine review of an anti-dumping probe,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman.\n\nFor many European companies, authenticity is valued almost above all else. That can mean adhering to intricate traditions, painstakingly slow production methods and strict requirements regarding the origins of their goods.\n\nThat commitment, whether it’s French Champagne or Swiss cheese, has led people all over the world to associate European products with high quality. But these rules can also make it more difficult to respond to external challenges because they provide limited room to cut costs.\n\nFor Italian pasta producers, which are already trying to adjust to the 15 percent U.S. tariff that the European Union agreed to in the summer, the additional 91.74 percent anti-dumping duties could push the total tariff to about 107 percent, a fresh blow that could create a barrier to selling in the United States.\n\nPresident Trump has wielded tariffs as an economic weapon to tackle myriad concerns, including bringing manufacturing to the United States and stopping drug smugglers, but the additional duties on Italian pasta are different. Intended to be apolitical and follow strict legal processes, anti-dumping duties are used around the world when governments believe companies or other countries are trading unfairly.\n\nThe United States first imposed anti-dumping tariffs on Italian pasta producers about 30 years ago. At the behest of American companies, the Department of Commerce routinely investigates Italian producers for cheaply selling pasta.\n\nThis year, an investigation was requested by two American companies, 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns Ronzoni pasta, and Winland Foods, which makes pasta under several brands, including San Giorgio and Prince.\n\nFor them, it was a routine request. The brands owned by Winland Foods have requested anti-dumping investigations for decades. Winland Foods declined to comment, and 8th Avenue Food & Provisions did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Commerce Department looked at the sales of Garofalo and La Molisana, another large Italian pasta producer, from July 2023 to June 2024. The department said that the companies had failed to provide the requested information and that, therefore, a penalty tariff would be imposed. But it would also apply to nearly a dozen other companies, including some of country’s largest producers, Barilla and Rummo.\n\nMr. Menna called the situation “unbelievable.” Sitting in Garofalo’s head office, he and Gianni Schisa, the operations director, insisted that they had provided the information required, as they had done in previous investigations.\n\nThey wondered if there had been a misunderstanding about the way the data was sent, or whether the staff at the Commerce Department involved in the investigation had changed, did not understand pasta exports or was confused by some labeling.\n\nGarofalo has pushed back against the decision. If its appeals fail, however, it will have to pay tariffs that cover the yearlong investigation, costing about 15 million euros ($17.4 million), Mr. Menna said. Tariffs would also be applied to future sales, a much more challenging situation. The final decision from the Commerce Department is not expected until early next year.\n\nThe Italian government and European Commission have intervened and made direct appeals to American officials, while speculation has grown about the political motivations for the tariffs.\n\nMr. Desai, the White House spokesman, said in a statement that the companies were at fault. “After they screwed up their initial responses, the Commerce Department explained to them what the problems were and asked them to fix those problems. They didn’t,” he said. “And then Commerce communicated the requirements again, and they didn’t answer for a third time.”\n\nHe added that the companies still had several months to engage with the review before the duties would be final. Still, the threat of punishing tariffs hangs over them.\n\nFor many households, pasta is a simple pantry staple that provides an easy-to-fix meal after school or after a long day at work. But in Gragnano, it is a craft that has defined the Italian town for centuries. Garofalo traces its history to 1789.\n\nHere, in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius, the sea breeze from the Mediterranean and the mountain air create the ideal humidity for drying pasta outside. Today, the town’s winding streets are still dotted with pastificios, as pasta makers are called. Near the central square is a mural depicting Totò, the Italian actor and comedian, stuffing a large handful of spaghetti directly into his mouth, an image from the 1954 film “Miseria e Nobiltà,” representing one of the most famous scenes in Italian cinema and the town’s devotion to pasta.\n\nThe anxiety about steep tariffs above 100 percent has spread through the town.\n\nA local pasta company, 28 Pastai, is not part of the anti-dumping investigation, but its chief executive, Elena Elefante, is still worried. She spent two years developing a unique blend of five Italian durum wheats to make the semolina for her company’s pasta in an effort to capture the traditional taste of pasta from Gragnano. She started selling her bronze-drawn pasta, made on the site of an old mill and pasta factory, in 2021.\n\nBut now she is worried that the duties will mean much higher prices on American shelves and create an opening for products that falsely proclaim they are made in Italy.\n\nThese duties could lead customers “not only to possibly turn away from the product because the price becomes, in short, unsustainable, but also to possibly prefer products that are labeled ‘Made in Italy’ with false labels,” she said.\n\nMs. Elefante said some customers had postponed orders amid the uncertainty. She said she had already offered discounts to customers since the 15 percent tariff rate went into effect, which cut into her profit margins.\n\nIt is an “alarming and worrying situation,” she said.\n\nHer 28 Pastai produces pasta for the East Coast supermarket chain Wegmans, among other clients. But high tariffs could also encourage buyers to reconsider Italian production. In the worst-case scenario, authentic premium Italian products like hers could disappear from American shelves, she said.\n\nGiovanni Milo, who opened a restaurant in the town three and a half years ago to honor his love of pasta, buys from local companies, including 28 Pastai. He said that if companies struggled to export, it was possible that they might raise prices at home. That is not happening yet, but he is conscious that overseas sales are essential to these local businesses.\n\nThough high anti-dumping duties are casting a shadow over Garofalo and diverting energy toward the investigations, appeals and diplomatic outreaches to overturn them, the company is still hopeful that the tariffs are a mistake that will be rectified.\n\n“We have the strength of the fact that we feel that we are right,” Mr. Menna said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/nyregion/eric-adams-israel-safety-mamdani.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:46:00-05:00","title":"In Israel, Adams Raises Doubts About Safety of Jews in New York","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mayor Eric Adams of New York visited Israel in late November 2025 to address rising global antisemitism, emphasizing the safety concerns of Jewish New Yorkers and contrasting his pro-Israel stance with that of Zohran Mamdani, who will become the city’s first Muslim mayor on January 1, 2026.

2025-11-16T18:46:00-05:00\n\nWith less than two months remaining in office, Mayor Eric Adams of New York landed in Israel over the weekend to meet with business and political leaders and discuss rising global antisemitism.\n\nUnspoken but implicit in his agenda was a desire to draw a clear contrast between his relationship with the Jewish community and that of Zohran Mamdani, a critic of Israel who will become New York’s first Muslim mayor when he is sworn in on Jan. 1.\n\nAt a reception in his honor hosted by the Combat Antisemitism Movement in Tel Aviv on Sunday, Mr. Adams took a question about the safety of Jews in New York under Mr. Mamdani. Rather than offer reassurance to Jewish New Yorkers who are on edge, he further stoked fears.\n\n“If I were a Jewish New Yorker, I’d be concerned about my children,” Mr. Adams said. “There is something to be worried about.” He added: “The community needs to prepare itself. Everything is not fine.”\n\nMr. Adams made similar comments during the mayoral campaign, warning that New York, home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, risked falling into “Islamic extremism” if Mr. Mamdani were elected.\n\nMr. Mamdani has pledged to be “a mayor for all New Yorkers” and has reached out to Jewish leaders and attended services at progressive synagogues. “We will build a City Hall that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of antisemitism,” he said in his victory speech on Nov. 4.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Adams also met with three Israelis who had been held hostage in Gaza; visited a counterterrorism training academy and a facility that develops drone systems; and prayed at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, a holy site he visited in 2023, before the war, during his first trip to Israel as mayor.\n\nMr. Adams described this trip as a chance to discuss “new opportunities to partner with our friends in Israel” — last year, Israeli firms contributed $13 billion to New York’s economy and helped fuel over 50,000 jobs, according to the United States-Israel Business Alliance.\n\nBut the journey was also personal. Mr. Adams has cultivated warm ties both with New York City’s Jewish communities, particularly Orthodox Jews, and with the Israeli government.\n\nShortly after arriving in Tel Aviv Saturday, Mr. Adams strolled down Nachalat Binyamin, a pedestrian thoroughfare lined with shops and cafes, before sitting down for a meal with Asaf Zamir, a former Israeli consul in New York.\n\nAnd at the reception Sunday, the mayor spoke emotionally about the period when he faced federal corruption charges, which the Trump administration eventually abandoned. “There were days that I didn’t want to get out of bed,” he said, calling that time “the most painful moment of my entire life.”\n\nMr. Adams, who abandoned plans to run for re-election in the face of low poll numbers, seems to be looking to spend his final weeks in office burnishing his place in history.\n\n“He’s the mayor of New York City, has 45 days left, and really wants to cement the legacy of the issues he cares about: using cutting-edge technology, fighting antisemitism and supporting Israel in a nonpartisan way,” said David G. Greenfield, the chief executive of the prominent New York Jewish charity Met Council, who accompanied Mr. Adams on his previous Israel trip. Mr. Greenfield noted that Mr. Zamir, the former consul, has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe mayor’s office declined to say whether Mr. Adams would also try to meet with Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nMr. Mamdani has said he would honor the International Criminal Court’s warrant against Mr. Netanyahu and order the police to arrest him if he set foot in the city. (Legal experts have said that such an arrest would be difficult to execute and could violate federal law.) He has also condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide and questioned Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state rather than one with equal rights for all regardless of religion.\n\nIn contrast, Mr. Adams said last week that Mr. Netanyahu should come to New York and attend Mr. Mamdani’s inauguration. He told the newspaper Israel Hayom over the weekend that Mr. Netanyahu “needs to make clear to the entire community” of Jews in New York “that he will continue visiting the city as often as possible.”\n\nMr. Mamdani’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Adams’s latest remarks on Sunday.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Adams, who visited Albania last month, said he was looking to relax a bit during his final days in office. “No. 1 thing I’m going to do is I’m going to have fun,” he said the day after Election Day.\n\nOn Sunday at the reception, Mr. Adams was asked about his plans after he leaves office. He suggested that he would start looking for a property to move to in Israel, prompting loud laughter from the audience.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/trump-pope-leo-maga-christianity.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"06:00:22-05:00","title":"Pope Leo Doesn’t Want to Be the Anti-Trump.

But He Is.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-16T06:00:22-05:00\n\nLast week, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a “special message” on immigration that was an unmistakable rebuke of the Trump administration and its cruel and punitive immigration crackdown. The message did not mention President Trump by name, but its meaning could not have been clearer.\n\nBy a vote of 216 to 5, with three abstentions, the bishops approved a statement that said, in part: “We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement. We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants.”\n\nThe bishops also opposed “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and prayed for “an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.”\n\nA number of bishops also read the statement out loud in a powerful video message posted on YouTube.\n\nThe bishops were following the lead of Pope Leo XIV, who has raised a number of specific objections to the Trump administration’s treatment of migrants. In September, the pope told journalists, “Someone who says I am against abortion but I am in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”\n\nOn Nov. 4, journalists asked the pope specifically about the treatment of detainees at the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill. Federal officials had denied entry to the facility to a delegation that included a Catholic bishop who hoped to offer communion to the inmates inside.\n\nThe pope responded with an appeal to Scripture: “Jesus says very clearly at the end of the world, we’re going to be asked, you know, how did you receive the foreigner? Did you receive him and welcome him or not? And I think that there’s a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what’s happening.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time that the Republican immigration crackdown has clashed with Catholic religious liberty. In January, I highlighted a disturbing case in Texas, where the attorney general, Ken Paxton, was directly attacking the religious freedom rights of the Annunciation House, a religious nonprofit founded by Catholics in El Paso. Paxton made the remarkable argument that blocking Annunciation House from providing food, shelter and clothing to migrants would not substantially burden its free exercise of religion.\n\nServing the most marginalized is fundamental to the Christian faith. By one count, more than 2,000 scriptural passages mandate or endorse service to the poor and the work of justice.\n\nIn May, just after the pope’s election, I wrote that the most important American in the world was no longer named Donald Trump. The president has less than four years left at the center of the international stage. The pope will present a global moral witness for years to come, and it’s a moral witness that is fundamentally incompatible with the cruelty and corruption of Trumpism.\n\nIf you examine the new pope’s pronouncements, there is a consistent through line. He defends human dignity and condemns government brutality. In addition to his defense of the human rights of migrants, he’s decried Russian abuses in Ukraine, and he’s called for a cease-fire, hostage release and compliance with international humanitarian law in Gaza.\n\nHis concern for human dignity extends to the world of technology and commerce as well. On Nov. 7, for example, he posted on social media: “Technological innovation can be a form of participation in the divine act of creation. It carries an ethical and spiritual weight, for every design choice expresses a vision of humanity. The Church therefore calls all builders of #AI to cultivate moral discernment as a fundamental part of their work—to develop systems that reflect justice, solidarity, and a genuine reverence for life.”\n\nThe pope’s comment drew an immediate rebuke from Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Trump supporter, who posted (and then deleted) a meme mocking the pope’s statement.\n\nEach of the pope’s statements are part of a consistent ethic of life. I love the Catholic writer Mark Shea’s description of what this ethic means — that “all human beings, without any exception whatsoever, are made in the image and likeness of God and that Jesus Christ died for all human beings, without any exception whatsoever. Therefore each human person — without any exception whatsoever — is sacred and is the only creature that God wills for its own sake.”\n\nIn this formulation, the fundamental moral basis of the pro-life movement is the idea that every single human being is created in the image of God and thus should be treated with dignity and respect at every stage of life, a concept that includes abortion but extends far beyond it as well.\n\nIn this context, it is a mistake to view abortion as somehow distinct from the dehumanization and abuse of migrants. The holistic pro-life view doesn’t just ask, “Is a baby being harmed?” It asks, “Are people being harmed?”\n\nAnd make no mistake, people are being harmed. To take just one dreadful example, on Wednesday, The Guardian reported that two human rights groups had found that “more than 252 Venezuelans expelled to El Salvador under Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy suffered systematic and prolonged torture and abuse, including sexual assault,” during their detention at a notorious El Salvadoran prison named CECOT.\n\nWhen I said that the path past Trumpism is beginning to emerge, I did not and do not mean that the pope will somehow enable the defeat of any particular politician or program at the ballot box. American Catholics are true swing voters. A majority voted for Trump in 2024, but a majority disapprove of him now. And there are many devout Catholics who are deeply embedded in the MAGA movement, including Vice President JD Vance.\n\nPartisanship is poisonous to the church. Neither party’s political platform truly embodies the teachings of the New Testament. Each party has its moral strengths and weaknesses, which is why you can find Christians and people of every faith and no faith on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nBut when partisanship becomes part of your identity — much less part of your faith — it has a pernicious effect: It causes you to highlight the deficiencies of the other side while tempting you to rationalize or minimize the injustices on your own. Partisanship makes hypocrites of us all. I know it made a hypocrite of me on my worst partisan days.\n\nThe approach that Pope Leo takes, by contrast, puts virtue outside and above politics. His declarations are the living embodiment of Martin Luther King Jr.’s admonition that the church “is not to be the master or the servant of the state, but the conscience of the state.”\n\nI’m not Catholic, but I can see that the Catholic Church enjoys some profound advantages over the American evangelical church in taking King’s approach. The Catholic Church is a global church that existed for more than a thousand years before the founding of America. American evangelicals, by contrast, often belong to churches and denominations that were founded in America, remain rooted in America, and they have a distinct, America-centered political worldview.\n\nSadly, this means that American evangelical influence is often rooted more in its partisan affiliations than in its moral witness. When Republicans dominate the government, evangelicals tend to feel more confident and secure. When Democrats win the White House, then evangelicals tend to feel more defensive and fearful, as if their churches are at the edge of extinction.\n\nThe result is a relentless one-way cultural ratchet that amplifies Democratic sins and minimizes Republican vices. It elevates politics to the place of religion because it is only through politics that many evangelicals can feel confident and secure in the practice of their faith.\n\nThis is why Trumpism is a thoroughly religious movement. Trump owes his political power to white evangelicals more than to any other group. In fact, according to exit polls, if you removed white evangelical votes from the 2024 presidential election, Trump would have lost in a 58-to-40 percent landslide, which would have been more than enough to turn the Electoral College in Kamala Harris’s favor.\n\nSince Trumpism is a religious phenomenon, it requires a religious answer. But it can’t be a partisan answer. That’s why it was wise for the bishops not to directly mention Trump in their statement. The goal isn’t to attack one man or one movement, but to uphold a particular set of values and to measure every politician — including politicians of your own party — by his or her dedication to the notion, as Mark Shea wrote, that “each human person — without any exception whatsoever — is sacred.”\n\nIf you’re a Republican in part because you believe that Democrats disregard the value of unborn life, that doesn’t mean that you abandon migrants to degrading and inhumane treatment because you don’t want to risk stoking outrage against the Republican Party and its leaders.\n\nConversely, it’s a profound mistake to swallow your tongue when Democrats advance permissive abortion rules because you’re worried that calling out, say, Chuck Schumer or Hakeem Jeffries will help Donald Trump.\n\nI’m under no illusions that Pope Leo’s example will matter to the evangelical political class. It is so far gone that many of its leading lights advance the absurd claim that Christians cannot vote for Democrats.\n\nBut a pope’s moral witness can — and should — still matter to Christians of every tradition. The American evangelical church is one tributary to the broad stream of American (much less global) Christianity. There is an enormous amount of theological cross-pollination in the United States.\n\nI know this because I’ve experienced it. Pope John Paul II’s seminal encyclical on the value of human life, Evangelium Vitae, has influenced me more than any Protestant book about the dignity of all human life. I grew up in an evangelical intellectual culture that saw Pope John Paul II’s opposition to the brutality of communism as an indispensable element in the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of liberal democracy in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn the words of Barbara Elliott, a fellow of the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, the pope achieved a “spiritual victory” over Soviet communism. He was the “spiritual leader of this peaceful revolution that shattered communism.”\n\nUnless the values behind Trumpism are defeated, the man himself will be replaced by another like him — Republican or Democrat — and our culture will continue to slide into cruelty and depravity.\n\nTo quote Pope Leo, “justice, solidarity, and a genuine reverence for life” ought to be the touchstones of our public engagement. There is another spiritual victory to be won — this time over the forces of hatred, division and cruelty in these United States.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

national elections on Sunday, the presidential candidates have been striving to outdo one another in promising harsh crackdowns on crime and immigration.\n\nDrug traffickers should “go to jail or they will go to the cemetery,” said one, Evelyn Matthei. “Bullet or jail,” said another, Franco Parisi, as he deemed drug trafficking “narcoterrorism.” And a third candidate, Johannes Kaiser, proposed executions for certain crimes.\n\nYet, as the tone of the campaign was trending unmistakably to the right, a new mandatory voting law that is likely to bring millions of new voters to the polls is adding a layer of unpredictability to the proceedings.\n\nFour years after Chileans elected Gabriel Boric, a young, progressive president many saw as the symbol of a new era for the Latin American left, the country now faces a deeply polarized electorate. Many voters are anxious over a surge in immigration and crime tied to transnational criminal networks, in what has long been one of Latin America’s safest countries.\n\nThe centrality of the issue — a core theme where the political right generally holds the advantage — has fueled the campaign of José Antonio Kast, the main conservative contender, who has borrowed liberally from President Trump’s playbook. But it has also helped the rise of Mr. Kaiser, who has positioned himself to the right of Mr. Kast, promising small-state liberalism and a tough hand on crime and immigration.\n\nThis weekend’s vote is expected to be the first of two rounds, as none of the candidates is likely to capture an outright majority. Polls show that the candidates with the best chance of making it to a runoff are Mr. Kast and — because the right-leaning candidates will split the conservative vote — Jeannette Jara, a Communist Party member.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Back then, a woman in Syria did not need to be fighting alongside the rebels trying to overthrow the dictator Bashar al-Assad to be snatched up into his system of imprisonment and torture.\n\nIt was enough just to be suspected of being a rebel’s wife or child.\n\nThe Assad regime treated the families of its perceived enemies as leverage, according to former prisoners and war monitoring groups. Women were seized to use against their husbands, and children to use against their imprisoned mothers.\n\nMs. Tamim, then 34 and a mother of five, was the wife of a rebel fighter in hiding at the time. She remembered that snow was falling on the day that the authorities led her and her children, aged 2 to 14 at the time, underground into a prison.\n\nIt was run by the Fourth Armored Division, an army unit that was closely linked to the Assad family. She was detained for six months.\n\nBack home in the remote village of Afrin in northwestern Syria, she spoke to The New York Times recently. She lives there with her husband, the former rebel fighter, and the youngest of their children (they now have seven).\n\nMs. Tamim was one of several female former prisoners who connected with one another through a support group organized by the Association of Detainees and Missing Persons of Sednaya Prison, Syria’s most notorious jail.\n\nThe women described being snatched up by the authorities, often without a formal accusation or proper trial, and disappearing for months or longer, with or without their children, into an abyss of physical and psychological torture.\n\nSome said they were still struggling to rebuild their families and their lives.\n\nOn Ms. Tamim’s first day in detention, she said interrogators demanded to know where her husband was. When she refused to answer, they smashed her forehead against the table until blood trickled into her mouth.\n\nThen they took her to a tiny, freezing cell, where her children were waiting. Ms. Tamim, like several other former prisoners, described being led to the cell past a labyrinth of torture devices: an electric chair, chains hanging from a ceiling. It was a not-so-subtle threat of what awaited her if she did not divulge the information they wanted.\n\nThe next day, she said, interrogators accused her of smuggling weapons and she was beaten until she passed out. Shaimaa, her eldest daughter, then 11, said she remembered hearing her mother’s screams and seeing her bruises.\n\nThe third day was worse.\n\nAfter whipping Ms. Tamim with a green pipe, she said the interrogators forced her to watch as they beat her children. First came her son Baraa, 14. When he passed out, it was Shaimaa, who said the interrogators used the same pipe on her.\n\nAfter that, Ms. Tamim said, she agreed to admit to anything. The violence stopped.\n\nHer captivity continued for more than six months, mostly at Al Khatib, the Damascus prison of a military intelligence branch. After a few weeks, Ms. Tamim said, officials removed her three youngest children to a government-run orphanage, telling her that she would never see them again. Baraa was moved to the adjacent men’s prison.\n\nAs a recent Times investigation documented, Mr. al-Assad’s government forcibly separated hundreds of children from their parents and placed them in orphanages, many under false identities.\n\nChildren of detainees may be among those who ended up in the orphanages, their true identities unknown.\n\nSome women described being detained and separated from their families even during the regime’s final months.\n\nSabah Harmoush, now 37, said she was detained in March last year, only nine months before Mr. al-Assad was ousted by rebels. Her husband and his brothers had joined the rebels.\n\nHer children, aged 4 to 13, were detained with her, as was her mother-in-law, Houda Mohammed Ajami, 57.\n\nThe family was taken to the Mezzeh prison in Damascus. During interrogations, they were kicked, whipped and punched, Ms. Ajami said, adding that Ms. Harmoush suffered the harshest beatings.\n\nAfter 20 days, her children were so hungry and so repulsed by prison food that they were chewing on their sneakers, and they were transferred to an orphanage, Ms. Harmoush said.\n\nHer mother-in-law, who had been recovering from surgery when the family was detained, said she suffered a heart attack after that and was taken to a hospital. She and her daughter-in-law were transferred to another prison.\n\nThe beatings stopped, and the two women were put on trial for terrorism.\n\nMs. Ajami spent a total of four months in prison. Ms. Harmoush was returned to the Mezzeh prison, escaping only when the regime fell in December.\n\nShe said she was reunited with her children shortly after that. The two youngest did not recognize her.\n\nSome women were imprisoned repeatedly.\n\nMayada Alshamali, 51, the wife of a rebel from the Damascus suburb of Douma, said she had been detained twice. The first time was in 2013 and lasted seven months. Six of her seven children were detained with her. Her other child, then 11, was held separately.\n\nShe was detained again in 2015 for two and a half years, separated from her 2-month-old child while she was still breastfeeding.\n\nSeveral women described extremely harsh conditions in Al Khatib.\n\nIman al-Diab, now 40, said she spent two years there. She was detained in Damascus in 2014 after she became an anti-Assad political activist. Her husband, once a soldier in Mr. al-Assad’s army, had defected to the rebels and was imprisoned.\n\nHer three young children remained with her husband’s parents.\n\nMs. al-Diab said she was held with dozens of other women in a single cell, so crowded they took turns standing and lying tightly huddled together, surviving. Six other women remained imprisoned with her while others came and went.\n\nOne of the women jailed with her, Azab, said that there had been no access to bathing facilities, constant fluorescent light and little sleep. She asked to be identified by only her first name for fear of retribution.\n\nWomen who were released or transferred left their underwear and pajamas behind for those who remained, Ms. al-Diab said. She and Azab said that they were among at least 15 women who joined a hunger strike.\n\nMs. al-Diab said she was tied up, tortured by electric shocks and beaten so badly that she still winced when she recalled it. Their only salvation was sleep.\n\n“We slept only to see our children in our dreams,” she said.\n\nAzab said it took her a year after her release to locate her children, who were living with her former husband. The youngest did not recognize her.\n\nAs for Ms. Tamim, she and her son Baraa were released in May 2015 as part of a swap deal. Rebels handed over the bodies of four high-ranking regime officers and about $12,000, according to her husband, who said he had helped negotiate the exchange.\n\nMs. Tamim and Baraa drove to an orphanage that night to collect her other children. As they pulled up, she said, she heard the three voices and saw her children running to embrace her.\n\nThe youngest, Mugheira — who was less than 3 when they were detained — clasped his arms around Ms. Tamim’s neck, looked into her eyes and asked, “Are you my mom?”\n\nHe would not let go.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/arts/television/ken-burns-american-revolution.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"05:01:36-04:00","title":"Can Ken Burns Win the American Revolution?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ken Burns, the acclaimed documentary filmmaker, is preparing to release a six-part, 12-hour documentary titled 'The American Revolution' on PBS on November 16, 2025.

2025-10-23T05:01:36-04:00\n\nIt was a brilliant early fall morning in upstate New York, and Ken Burns was back on the battlefield.\n\nHe had just driven two hours from his home in New Hampshire to a rolling meadow outside Saratoga Springs, where the view has changed little since the Continental Army scored its first major victory over the British in 1777. After climbing onto the porch of an 18th-century farmhouse, he started delivering his now-familiar spiel to a small group of journalists and local officials.\n\n“The American Revolution is encrusted with the barnacles of sentimentality and nostalgia,” he said. But his six-part, 12-hour documentary about the subject, which debuts on PBS on Nov. 16, will aim to strip that away — and hopefully bring some healing to our own fractured moment.\n\n“We say, ‘Oh we’re so divided,’ as if we’re Chicken Little and this is the worst it’s ever been,” he said. “But the Revolution was a pretty divided time. The Civil War was a pretty divided time. Almost all of American history is division.”\n\nMaybe storytelling, he said, can “help short-circuit the binaries we have today.”\n\nThe remarks were pure Burns — the kind of sunny all-American optimism that thrills his admirers, and draws eye-rolls among skeptics. But “The American Revolution,” which Burns directed with Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, is arriving at a moment when even attempting to bring a unifying story to a broad American middle feels like a radical act.\n\nSince returning to office, President Trump has renewed his call for a return to celebratory “patriotic” history, blasting away at those he accuses of slandering the past. He’s moved to purge the Smithsonian of what he deems “divisive race-based ideology,” and ordered material that “disparages Americans” to be removed from National Park sites. In July, his Republican allies in Congress eliminated federal funding altogether for PBS, Burns’s longtime broadcast home.\n\n“The American Revolution,” with its frank discussions of slavery and Native American dispossession, certainly cuts against the Trumpist view of history. But in a six-month, 32-city promotional tour across red, blue and purple America, Burns has been sticking relentlessly to a hopeful, nonpartisan, nonconfrontational script.\n\nWhether at sold-out events organized by PBS affiliates or on bro-friendly podcasts like Joe Rogan and Theo Von, he has talked again and again (and again) about “putting the us back in U.S.,” and hailed the Revolution as “the most significant event in human history since the birth of Christ.”\n\nAt every stop, he has talked about the preciousness of democracy and defended PBS, where he is as synonymous as Big Bird. But he has rarely uttered the words “Donald Trump.”\n\nIn an interview last month in New York City, Burns acknowledged the charged moment. But when it comes to the film, he insisted, his responsibility is the same as it has always been: to tell the story of the past straight, to as many Americans as possible.\n\n“I just really hope the film has an ability to speak to the people who are concerned about the direction of the country, whoever that might be,” he said. “This spectacularly inspiring story of our founding, as dark and complex as it is, has — I think, I hope — the ability to add something to the conversation right now that is unifying.”\n\nBurns started working on the film in December 2015, while finishing up his documentary on the Vietnam War. Barack Obama had 13 months left in the White House, and enthusiasm for the upbeat, inclusive vision of the founding in the musical “Hamilton” was at its peak.\n\nThe filmmakers’ main concern wasn’t politics or historiography, but something more basic: How do you make a compelling documentary with no photographs, no newsreels, no living witnesses and a visual record that reads to many Americans as starchy and boring?\n\n“The American Revolution,” which cost more than $30 million, began with the building of an archive. As the historian Geoffrey C. Ward (who has written 20 of Burns’s documentaries) dove into scholarship on the Revolution, researchers assembled more than 18,000 maps, engravings, paintings and documents, culled from nearly 350 galleries, museums and libraries.\n\nThe film makes ample use of the famous “Ken Burns effect,” with the camera panning across static images. It also uses newer tools, like the CGI maps used in some battle sequences. But the biggest departure was the use of re-enactors.\n\nThe cinematography team, led by Burns’s longtime collaborator Buddy Squires, filmed hundreds of re-enactors and costumed interpreters across the 13 colonies, in all kinds of weather. Shooting overhead with drones and up close on the ground, they captured soldiers and sailors, but also washerwomen, blacksmiths and farmers.\n\n“We wanted to find a way to make people feel real and alive, including those who didn’t leave a lot behind that lets you figure out how to recreate them,” Botstein said.\n\nThe spine of the documentary is the military story, which is highlighted in 36 often suspenseful (and speaker-rattling) battle sequences, from the famous (Bunker Hill, Yorktown) to the more obscure. But its emotional heart is the first-person testimony of nearly 150 historical characters from all segments of society, read by 61 different voice actors.\n\nWe hear plenty from the Founding Fathers. But we also get the words of women, Native Americans, free and enslaved Africans, poor Irish immigrants, German mercenaries — all of whom wrestle with what it means to seek freedom, and often find very different answers.\n\nThat approach is very much in keeping with the latest scholarship, which depicts the Revolution as a hyper-violent civil war that divided families and communities and left many Native Americans and African Americans worse off, and less free. And the film doesn’t demonize loyalists, who were sometimes subjected to horrific retribution.\n\n“They weren’t bad people,” Burns said. “They were just what we would call conservatives.”\n\nThe film notes that while roughly 5,000 Black people, free and enslaved, fought on the patriot side, an estimated 15,000 fought for the British, who promised them freedom (a promise that was largely betrayed).\n\nBut for many viewers, the most eye-opening part of the documentary may be the centrality of Native Americans. They are presented not as victims or bystanders, but as members of powerful nations faced with complex choices about how to defend their own liberty.\n\nIn the prologue, the film’s narrator, Peter Coyote, says the Revolution was sparked by disputes over “Indian land, taxation and representation.” It’s an acknowledgment that the colonists’ desire for unfettered access to Native lands was a primary cause of the break with Britain, which had forbidden any settlement west of the Appalachians.\n\nThat theme is echoed throughout the documentary. One of the most chilling sequences describes the Sullivan campaign of 1779, in upstate New York, where Washington ordered the destruction of all villages, crops and orchards of the Seneca and Cayuga, who had allied with the British. “You will not by any means listen to any overture for peace, before the total ruin of their settlements is effected,” Washington declared.\n\nBut the film is not an exercise in tearing down heroes. In one sequence, two historians — not a profession known for embracing the great-man view of the past — each describe Washington as the essential man of the Revolution, who kept the 13 colonies united through eight years of war.\n\n“He was the glue that held people together,” the historian Annette Gordon-Reed says, adding, “We would not have had a country without him.”\n\nBurns has had a complicated relationship with academic scholars, who have sometimes dismissed his films as sugary and sentimental, too quick to paper over unresolved divisions with appeals to unity. “The Civil War,” in particular, has drawn persistent criticism for what some see as a romanticized depiction of the conflict as a family feud that stemmed mainly from a failure to compromise.\n\nFor “The American Revolution,” the filmmakers drew on two dozen historical consultants, who offered extensive comments on multiple drafts and rough cuts. They include best-selling authors like Joseph Ellis and Stacy Schiff, along with leading academic scholars of three generations and multiple perspectives, from Bernard Bailyn to Ned Blackhawk.\n\nTheir differing views appear onscreen not as an argument, but as a kind of chorus — a reminder that the Revolution meant, and still means, different things to different people.\n\nIt remains to be seen what Burns’s version will mean to viewers, including ideologues who may be ready to pounce. Last January, Burns and Botstein appeared with three historians at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association. When someone brought up the possibility of political attacks, there was a pause, then nervous laughter.\n\n“We’d love your help in getting it out and making sure in the local areas it isn’t excised in a way that just favors one shocking thing,” Burns said.\n\nThat fear remains. But some scholars who worked on the film said they sense a hunger across the political spectrum for a conversation that stands outside today’s partisan polemics.\n\nKathleen DuVal, a historian at the University of North Carolina, calls it “inspiration with content.”\n\n“People want to be reminded why having a republic is important and what people did to get it,” she said.\n\nJane Kamensky, a former Harvard professor who is now the president and chief executive at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello, said the film offers a “head and heart synthesis” that leaves room for viewers to reach their own conclusions.\n\n“The Revolution was the Big Bang of the question of what it means to be one people,” Kamensky said. “That was there in 1776, and it’s there now. But at no point in working with the team did I feel like they were forcing resonances.”\n\nStill, 2025 has relentlessly forced those resonances.\n\nIn March, during an appearance at West Point, Burns received an enthusiastic response from cadets in the grand Gothic dining hall. But a few weeks later, word came that a similar event at the Naval Academy would be postponed, out of concern that Burns’s criticisms of President Trump during the 2024 campaign might draw an outcry from conservatives.\n\nOn July 4, after a swing through Georgia, the Carolinas and Texas, Burns was at Monticello, in Virginia, where he was the speaker at the annual naturalization ceremony. Before the event, in a makeshift green room in Jefferson’s front hall, someone brought up President Trump’s plans, announced the night before, for a UFC mixed-martial arts fight on the White House lawn next summer as part of the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nBurns dropped an un-Jeffersonian expletive. But out on Jefferson’s lawn, where the crowd was dressed mostly in red, white and blue, with a smattering of “I ❤️ PBS” T-shirts, he kept the tone high.\n\nWhatever its messy origins, he said, quoting the film’s prologue, the Revolution came to be about “the noblest aspirations of humankind.”\n\n“That is what this special day, then and now, and every moment in between, and where we will be next July — and onward — is all about,” he said.\n\nStill, the less uplifting historical resonances have continued to pile up. In August, after the president deployed the National Guard in Washington, the first episode of the documentary premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. When the film quoted a colonist protesting the British deployment of troops to an increasingly rebellious Boston, the audience, Burns said, “erupted.”\n\nOn the promotional trail, Burns has been careful to avoid any partisan edge. But during the Saratoga trip, while waiting between events, the author Rick Atkinson, a prominent voice in the film, spoke more pointedly.\n\n“What did the founders fear most? What did they most fear?” He paused. “It wasn’t the British. They most feared the rise to power of an autocrat who did not share the values that the founders tried to embrace.”\n\nSo far, Burns’s insistence on both inspiration and complexity has played well with audiences, including those well outside the PBS orbit.\n\nEarlier this month, on Theo Von’s podcast, he and Von bantered about the nation’s astrological sign (Cancer), and whether it shares the sign’s virtues (emotional, imaginative, loyal) and flaws (moodiness, insecurity, pessimism).\n\nWhen Von suggested the Declaration was “kind of a love letter to the future,” Burns bounced on his seat, eyes widening.\n\n“Oh my God, that’s the best expression I’ve ever heard!” he said, before pivoting to a favorite anecdote about Thomas Paine.\n\nIt was much the same in June when Burns flew to Austin, Texas, to record “The Joe Rogan Experience.” Over nearly three hours, he and Rogan talked about the need for heroes, and for honest accounting of their flaws. For much of the conversation, as Burns ran through his chestnuts, Rogan barely got a word in edgewise beyond “Wow.”\n\nIt’s a reaction Burns loves — proof that the audience for open-minded, fact-based history is still out there.\n\n“That’s a very powerful thing,” he said, “when people let go of their own dialectical or polemical objectives and just say ‘Wow, I had no idea.’”\n\n"}]}
