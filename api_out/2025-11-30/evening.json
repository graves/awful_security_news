\nUpdated: \n        8:18 PM EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Venezuelan President  Nicolás Maduro  made his first public appearance in days on Sunday, putting to an end speculation within the country that he had fled amid escalating tensions with the US.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, who usually appears on Venezuelan television multiple times a week, had not been seen in public since Wednesday – when he posted a video of himself driving around Caracas on his Telegram channel – leading to intense speculation as to his whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, he appeared at an annual specialty-coffee awards event in eastern Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  In images that were broadcast online, the president sat before a crowd and handed out medals to coffee producers showcasing their top products. He sipped various coffees while delivering brief remarks – none of which openly addressed the current crisis in the country.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the event, he chanted that Venezuela is “indestructible, untouchable, unbeatable” while speaking about the nation’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  The remarks appeared to be a nod to the tensions with the US, which has sent more than a dozen warships and deployed roughly 15,000 troops to the region as part of what it says is an effort to combat drug trafficking – but Caracas believes is an attempt to force Maduro from office.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro’s appearance at the coffee awards event came just moments after US President  Donald Trump  confirmed he had spoken with the Venezuelan leader on the phone.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to comment on that – the answer is yes,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked whether the call had taken place. “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.”\n \n\n   \n  The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Trump and Maduro spoke by phone earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro and senior members of his government have not commented on the phone call with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Jorge Rodríguez, who heads Venezuela’s National Assembly, declined to discuss the conversation, saying it was not the purpose of his press conference – which instead focused on announcing an inquiry into recent US maritime strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that have killed more than 80 people.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the US president has increased the pressure on Maduro by warning that strikes on land against drug trafficking networks could be coming “very soon” and telling airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace.\n \n\n   \n  However, speaking on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump told reporters his warning about Venezuelan airspace was not a signal that an airstrike is imminent.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t read anything into it,” the president said, adding he made the airspace warning “because we consider Venezuela to be not a very friendly country.”\n \n\n   \n    US wants our oil, Maduro tells OPEC\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in what appeared to be a further ratcheting up of tensions, Maduro wrote to OPEC accusing the US of seeking to seize Venezuela’s oil reserves through force, while the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly accused the US of “murder” regarding recent military strikes on alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the secretary general of OPEC, Haitham Al Ghais, dated November 30, Maduro accused the US of making “constant and repeating express threats” toward his country, in a move that he said “seriously endangers the stability of Venezuelan oil production and the international market.”\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s oil reserves are thought to be among the largest in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil Pinto posted the letter to OPEC on Telegram, alongside a vow that Venezuela would “remain firm in defending its natural energy resources.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing will stop us. We will continue to be free and sovereign!” Pinto wrote.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the letter.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, the US State Department has pushed back against such claims. Responding to a  CNN exclusive  in which Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Trump’s interests in Venezuela were about oil, rather than drug trafficking, it said the administration remains “firm in its counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and its commitment to protecting Americans from the Maduro regime’s deadly poison.”\n \n\n   \n    Boat killings are ‘murder,’ Venezuela says\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Sunday, Venezuela accused the US of “murder,” after publicly acknowledging for the first time that some of its citizens were among those killed by the US strikes on alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no declared war (between the US and Venezuela), therefore this cannot be classified as anything but murder,” Rodriguez, the National Assembly president, told a press conference Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “Every human being has the right to due process; no human being can be killed in a brutal manner,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  This is the first time Caracas has said openly that some of its citizens have been killed by the US strikes, which have been going on since September.\n \n\n   \n  Rodriguez, a key figure of Maduro’s government, said that he had met with the families of those killed and that the Venezuelan parliament would convene on Monday to “create a special commission to investigate the serious events that led to the murder of Venezuelans in the Caribbean.”\n \n\n   \n  The investigation, he said, would look into  reports  that the US military carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating  in the Caribbean on September 2  after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon how many Venezuelans had been killed in the strikes, Rodriguez did not provide a number, saying only, “tomorrow we begin the investigation, once we know, we will share that information.”\n \n\n   \n  The Maduro government has also been accused of extrajudicial killings and violation of human rights in the past. According to a statement from the Office of the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, Venezuelans facing government repression are routinely denied a fair trial.\n \n\n   \n  More than 50 Venezuelans have been detained in the month of October alone for political reasons, human rights groups told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Venezuelan government has denied allegations of human rights abuse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/politics/follow-up-strike-lawmakers-concern","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00-05:00","title":"Lawmakers from Both Parties Voice Concerns Over Follow-Up Strike on Alleged Drug Boat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lawmakers from both parties have raised serious concerns over a follow-up military strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean on September 2, 2025, which killed survivors after the initial strike failed to eliminate all on board.

Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said the follow-up strike was “completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress” about the  Trump administration’s strikes  on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN that the military carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating  in the Caribbean on September 2  after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. Before the operation, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to ensure the strike killed everyone on board, but it’s not clear whether he knew there were survivors before the second strike, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, told CBS that the attack “rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who has been a target of the  Trump administration’s ire  for participating in a video reminding service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders, said Sunday that the strike could possibly be a war crime.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to,” Kelly, a former fighter pilot who served in the Navy for 25 years, told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n \n\n   \n  “If what has been reported is accurate, I’ve got serious concerns about anybody in that … chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over,” Kelly said on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  The comments come after the Republican-led Senate and House armed services committees said pledged oversight on the follow-up strike.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate Armed Service Committee’s Republican chair, Sen. Roger Wicker, and top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed, said in a statement late Friday they “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  They were followed by their counterparts in the House, Reps. Mike Rogers and Adam Smith, who said Saturday they are “taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting” of the strike.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously reported that people briefed on the “double-tap” strike said they were concerned that it could violate the law of armed conflict, which prohibits the execution of an enemy combatant who is “hors de combat,” or taken out of the fight due to injury or surrender.\n \n\n   \n  While the first strike appeared to disable the boat and cause deaths, the military assessed there were survivors, according to sources familiar with the matter. The second attack killed the remaining crew on board, bringing the total death toll to 11, and sank the ship.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth in a  social media post  Friday continued to defend the strikes on alleged drug boats, writing, “Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump expressed confidence on Sunday that Hegseth did not order a second strike and signaled that he would not have approved of one.\n \n\n   \n  “No. 1, I don’t know that that happened, and Pete said he did not want them — he didn’t even know what people were talking about,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “So, we’ll look into it, but no, I wouldn’t have wanted that, not a second strike.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether he believes there wasn’t a second strike, Trump said, “I don’t know; I’m going to find out about it. But Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Alison Main and Kit Maher contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/us/shooting-stockton-california-injured-dead-investigation-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"19:56:00-05:00","title":"3 Children Among the 4 Killed at a California Birthday Party Shooting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mass shooting at a birthday party in Stockton, California, killed three children and one adult, with 11 others wounded.

joyous event —turned into the site of a mass shooting Saturday night that left three children and one other person dead and 11 wounded, with the suspected shooter still on the run.\n \n\n   \n  The tragedy in Stockton, California, adds to a growing list of American communities whose everyday spaces –  schools ,  shopping centers ,  bars  and  office buildings  – have experienced gun violence.\n \n\n   \n  Children and adults were among those shot, according to Heather Brent, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office. Officials did not immediately release the conditions of those taken to area hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  “Early indications suggest this may have been a targeted incident,” Brent said at a news conference. “This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Those killed were ages 8, 9, 14 and 21, Brent said Sunday. Authorities have not released the names of the victims.\n \n\n   \n  Sheriff Patrick Withrow made a plea to the community Sunday to continue providing information to his office about the shooting, no matter how small it may be.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confident in our team and with the work that we have done so far that we will find these animals that did this and bring them justice, but we still need the public’s help.” Withrow said.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting occurred just before 6 p.m. in the northern part of the city, according to the  sheriff’s office . The banquet hall, which shares a parking lot with several businesses, including a Dairy Queen, was hosting a family celebration that investigators were told was a birthday party for a young child with 100 to 150 people in attendance, Brent said. Stockton is about 40 miles south of Sacramento.\n \n\n   \n  The suspected shooter fled and remains at large, Brent said. Officials are urging the public for help with information as detectives work to determine a possible motive. “Investigators are exploring all possibilities,” Brent said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re confident that this was not a random act,” Withrow said Sunday. “We’re not gonna say whether it’s gang related or not, until we have all the facts in front of us.”\n \n\n   \n  Withrow said he drove more than eight hours and, had to, “put down my grandbabies to come hunt down these animals who took somebody else’s babies away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  “My heart goes out to the families of those killed, the injured, and the survivors,” said  former Rep. Gabby Giffords , herself a survivor of gun violence and founder of the gun violence prevention organization  GIFFORDS .\n \n\n   \n  “While we await for more information on the shooting, what is painfully obvious is that we need our federal leaders to act to stop gun violence.”\n \n\n   \n  There have been at least 380 mass shootings in the US so far this year – defined as when at least four people are shot, not including the shooter – according to the  Gun Violence Archive .\n \n\n   \n  In January, a shooting at Martin’s Super Market in Elkhart, Indiana, left two people dead and two police officers injured. In August, a man walked into the lobby of a Park Avenue skyscraper in New York City, killed a police officer, then opened fire on other innocent strangers. The next month in Colorado, a shooting at Evergreen High School left two students critically wounded after a fellow student allegedly opened fire during their third week of classes.\n \n\n   \n  California Gov.

Its $156 million estimated gross is the second-best five-day Thanksgiving debut, behind Disney’s animated adventure movie “Moana 2,” which opened in 2024 to $225 million domestically.\n \n\n   \n  “Disney has made it an event that comes virtually every year over the Thanksgiving holiday,” said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. “Families just embraced (‘Zootopia 2’) in such a profound way.”\n \n\n   \n  The end-of-year holiday season is as important to Hollywood as the highly lucrative summer season, especially when coming off of a historically bad October, noted Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of analytics firm Box Office Theory.\n \n\n   \n  Hollywood stuck to its formula from last year,   when a “Wicked” film and an animated sequel from Disney drew big audiences to theaters. Last weekend,   “Wicked: For Good” beat expectations when it opened to $150 million. It raked in another $62.8 million Friday through Sunday, bringing its domestic total to $270.4 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting spoiled by these last two years. It’s really hard to pull that off,” Robbins said. “It also goes to show the power of female-skewing films at the box office, because neither of these are male-driven blockbusters.”\n \n\n   \n  Together, “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2” earned a combined $249 million domestically over the five days, according to Comscore data. “Zootopia 2” also earned $400 million internationally, bringing it to an estimated $556 million globally. And “Wicked: For Good” has earned $393.25 million globally since its debut.\n \n\n   \n  The two films are more complementary than competitive, largely because the PG-rated movies appealed to family audiences and opened during two separate weekends, according to Dergarabedian.\n \n\n   \n  “They did not really detract at all from each other … This performance was born out of having a perfectly curated, perfectly strategized release of these two movies,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lionsgate Films’ “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” came in at No. 3, earning $7 million Friday through Sunday, followed by Disney’s “Predator: Badlands” ($4.8 million) and Paramount Pictures’ “The Running Man” ($3.7 million).\n \n\n   \n  A24’s romantic comedy “Eternity” opened to a meager $5.2 million over the five-day weekend, notching the No. 6 spot overall.\n \n\n   \n  Romantic comedies have dwindled in popularity at the box office in recent years, according to analysts. In 2009, there were 20 romantic comedy wide releases, compared with up to four annual releases today, according to David A. Gross, who publishes industry newsletter FranchiseRe.\n \n\n   \n  At No. 8 this weekend was the opening of Focus Features’ “Hamnet” ($1.35 million). The historical drama detailing Shakespeare’s inspiration for the play “Hamlet” is considered a contender for Academy Award nominations.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts are hopeful that Hollywood could rake in a whopping $9 billion at the domestic box office this year. The box office is currently up 1.24% year-to-date and would need another $1.2 billion to reach that milestone, according to Dergarabedian.\n \n\n   \n  “The strength of the schedule overall still points to $9 billion being very, very likely,” said Robbins, who noted that the industry will either fall short or slightly above the $9 billion mark. It may largely rely on Disney’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which opens on December 19.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/europe/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-miami-florida-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00-05:00","title":"Trump says there’s a ‘good chance’ a deal can be reached to end the war after US-Ukraine talks in Florida","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following high-level US-Ukraine peace talks in Miami, President Donald Trump expressed optimism, stating there is a 'good chance' of a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian delegation in Miami on Sunday, suggesting there was a “good chance” of a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Talks were “going along, and they’re going along well,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there’s a good chance we can make a deal,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  His comments came after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio cast the peace talks as fragile, and underscored that Russia would  have a central role to play in any deal.\n \n\n   \n  “This is delicate, it’s complicated,” Rubio told reporters after the meeting, which included special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there’s another party involved here that they’ll have to be a part of the equation,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n  The Secretary of State described the meeting in Miami as “a very productive and useful session where … additional progress was made,” but cautioned that more work remained. He said the administration’s diplomatic push would intensify this week.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff will travel to Moscow on Monday, where he is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a US official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said US officials had “been in touch in varying degrees with the Russian side, but we have a pretty good understanding of their views as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The top US diplomat said the teams were not only working on terms that would end the fighting between Ukraine and Russia but also “terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the meeting began, Rubio said the goal of the negotiations was to create “a pathway forward that leaves Ukraine sovereign, independent, and prosperous.”\n \n\n   \n  The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umerov, said that the meeting was “productive and successful” and had built on the success of the previous US-Ukraine talks in Geneva\n \n\n   \n  “Our objective is a prosperous, strong Ukraine,” Umerov told reporters, “We discussed all the matters that are important for Ukraine. And the US was super supportive.”\n \n\n   \n  Umerov, head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, was appointed to head the Ukrainian team after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, resigned on Friday amid a corruption scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine is seeking international security guarantees as part of any agreement to end the war and a ceasefire based on the current front lines. It has rejected ceding any territory not already occupied by Russian forces.\n \n\n   \n  But Putin has shown little sign he’s ready to offer concessions, saying that the war would only end “once Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy.”\n \n\n   \n  Rubio met Ukrainian negotiators in Geneva last weekend, when substantial revisions were made to the original 28-point blueprint   developed by Witkoff and Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund and a Kremlin special envoy.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s European allies said that the original plan – which was seen as highly favorable to Russia – would require “additional work.”\n \n\n   \n  Putin’s aide Yuri Ushakov said last week the Kremlin had received the latest version of the plan.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t an official one, but we do have the document. We haven’t discussed it with anyone yet because the points in it require truly serious analysis and discussion,” Ushakov said.\n \n\n   \n  After suggesting that he wanted Ukraine to agree to a deal by Thursday of last week, Trump backed away from imposing any kind of deadline.\n \n\n   \n  “You know what the deadline for me is? When it’s over,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The negotiations come against a backdrop of persistent Russian missile and drone attacks against cities and infrastructure across Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that in the last week, Russia had used nearly 1,400 attack drones, 1,100 guided aerial bombs, and 66 missiles in attacks.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Ukraine continues to target Russian energy and defense infrastructure with long-range drones and domestically manufactured missiles. Ukraine also used maritime drones on Friday and Saturday in strikes in the Black Sea against two sanctioned oil tankers used to ship Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  The two tankers, which flew under the Gambian flag, were damaged but not sunk.\n \n\n   \n  As the negotiations continue, Ukraine’s former military chief of staff, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who is considered a﻿ potential rival to Zelensky, wrote in the Daily Telegraph Sunday that “war does not always end with the victory of one side and the defeat of the other.”\n \n\n   \n  “We Ukrainians strive for complete victory, but we cannot reject the option of a long-term end to the war,” Zaluzhnyi wrote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/us/sarah-beckstrom-andrew-wolfe-national-guard","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"10:18:00.000-05:00","title":"Two National Guard Members Injured in Washington, D.C.

Patrick Morrisey told CNN’s Sara Sidner.\n \n\n   \n  “Please keep my son in your prayers,” Wolfe’s father, Jason Wolfe, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  His son is “a great person” and “he’s a fighter,” he shared.\n \n\n   \n  Those who knew Beckstrom are remembering her as a kind soul known to go the extra mile for the benefit of others.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard members were two of thousands of soldiers from multiple states who responded to the nation’s capital in August as part of  Trump’s surge  of federal law enforcement in the area.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what we know about the two National Guard members:\n \n\n   \n    Sarah Beckstrom\n \n\n   \n  Beckstrom, of Summersville, West Virginia, began her service on June 26, 2023, and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade, West Virginia Army National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Those who knew her described someone who was filled with love and cared deeply about her community, which was exemplified in the work she did for the National Guard and her job at a behavioral health center.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping others could spend Thanksgiving at home, Beckstrom had volunteered to work in DC over the holiday.\n \n\n   \n  “She volunteered, as did many of those guardsmen and women, so other people could be home with their families,” Attorney General Pam Bondi told  Fox News  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Even before joining the military, she had “always demonstrated the strength, character, and commitment that make our school and community proud,” according to Webster County High School in Upperglade, where she graduated in 2023.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿ Since January, Beckstrom worked as a community engagement specialist at the behavioral health center  Seneca Health Services , which showed, along with her position with the National Guard, “how she had a desire to be a part of the solutions,” the company’s CEO Marcie Vaughan said.\n \n\n   \n  “It takes compassion, courage, and discipline to serve in any section or area of the armed forces and Sarah had all of those qualities and more,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Carr, a former boyfriend who dated Beckstrom for six years, called her a “loving, caring person” who “had a huge heart,” which was clear even in the little things she did for him.\n \n\n   \n  “She would make lunch for me in the morning, I’d get up by the crack of the dawn and it’s still dark and she’d be out there in the kitchen making some sandwiches, throwing in some chips, asking what type of fruit I wanted,” Carr said. “I told her not to worry about it, and she would still get up for it anyways, even though she’s got work in a few hours and could be sleeping.”\n \n\n   \n  Even if she didn’t know you, “She’d do anything for you,” Carr said. “One of the best people around that you could meet.”\n \n\n   \n  During her high school years, Beckstrom worked at a local   restaurant in Webster Springs, West Virginia, a small, tight-knit town nestled in the valley of three mountains.\n \n\n   \n  At The Custard Stand, known for its chili dogs and located on the town’s main road, Beckstrom was happy serving and interacting with customers, said Alissa Clayton, whose family owns the restaurant.\n \n\n   \n  Like Beckstrom’s family, Clayton said, many residents were proud to see her serve in the National Guard. “I think she’ll be remembered as the hero,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Webster County has a very strong community,” she said. “We just really care deeply for each other, and we want to see each other be successful …. I remember her mom posting pictures of her in her uniform, and just thinking like how wonderful it was that she was out there serving our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Beckstrom died Thursday, her father Gary Beckstrom took to Facebook. “My baby girl has passed to glory. If I don’t talk to you don’t be offend(ed),” he wrote. “This has been a horrible tragedy.”\n \n\n   \n  Local and federal law enforcement lined the streets in Washington, DC, Thursday night during  a dignified transfer  for Beckstrom, in a procession held to honor the remains of a fallen service member.\n \n\n   \n  While she was known for her kindness and loyalty, she was also an “ecstatic, outgoing” person and a “homebody” who enjoyed fishing and hunting, Carr said. He recalled how excited his former girlfriend was when she caught her first buck last hunting season.\n \n\n   \n  “I was getting letters about it and pictures, and she couldn’t explain how happy she was,” Carr said.\n \n\n   \n  “I loved her to pieces,” he said. “She never deserved any of that. I always wished the best for her.”\n \n\n   \n  Beckstrom had hoped to one day join the ranks of the FBI and saw the National Guard as a pathway to that goal, Carr said.\n \n\n   \n  She was originally dreading going to DC but had really grown to love it there, he said, even volunteering to stay longer.\n \n\n   \n  “The more she was there, the more she warmed up to it,” Carr said, because she started making friends and took delight in seeing all the monuments across the nation’s capital.\n \n\n   \n  After the shooting, many in Webster Springs are shaken up and frustrated because “there’s not a lot of clarity of why it happened,” Clayton said.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew Wolfe\n \n\n   \n  Wolfe is the friend and neighbor who would give the shirt off his back to anyone who needs it, Michael Langone told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Langone, who lives in the apartment next door to Wolfe’s in Martinsburg, West Virginia, described   him   as a “great guy, great neighbor.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just hope his family’s doing okay with it,” Langone said. “They’ve always been good to us, and we’ve always looked out for each other, and that’s about being a good neighbor.”\n \n\n   \n  Wolfe  has been a member  of the West Virginia National Guard since February 5, 2019, and is assigned to the Force Support Squadron, 167th Airlift Wing.\n \n\n   \n  In his hometown of Martinsburg, neighbors and a former schoolmate were shocked at the news of the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “It spread so quickly,” said   Tara Newcomb, who went to school with Wolfe and was a few years behind him.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people liked him and knew him. I hope he’s doing okay,” Newcomb said.\n \n\n   \n  Tina Gesford, another one of Wolfe’s neighbors, said he is friendly, a “sweet kid” and “hard worker.” She often sees him on his way to work, or coming and going, clad in his West Virginia National Guard uniform.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting, she said, came as a shock.\n \n\n   \n  “It scares people,” Gesford said. “DC is crazy right now. So it’s scary thinking that one of our people are down there getting hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  As of Sunday, Wolfe was “hanging on,” West Virginia Rep. Riley Moore, a Republican, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “He is fighting for his life,” said Moore, who told CNN’s Dana Bash that he had spoken with Wolfe’s family. They asked that people continue to pray for him.\n \n\n   \n  “His family wants everybody to know he’s a fighter and he’s hanging in here,” Moore said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/middleeast/pope-leo-lebanon-foreign-visit-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"12:23:00-12:23","title":"Pope Leo arrives in Lebanon, bringing call for unity in crisis-hit nation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff, arrives in Beirut, Lebanon, on November 30, 2025, to deliver a message of peace amid rising regional tensions and internal crisis.

EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pope Leo XIV touched down in Lebanon’s capital Beirut on Sunday with the hope of being a “messenger of peace” as he began a  three-day visit  to the nation at the heart of a Middle East battered by recent conflicts, just days after an Israeli strike on southern Beirut.\n \n\n   \n  Standing below a message that read “Blessed Are The Peacemakers” at the presidential palace in Baabda, Leo urged people to remain in Lebanon amid an “exodus of young people and families seeking a future elsewhere” due to “uncertainty, violence, poverty and many other threats.”\n \n\n   \n  “We must not forget that remaining in our homeland and working day by day to develop a civilization of love and peace remains something very valuable,” he said in his address to the country’s authorities and civil society.\n \n\n   \n  Peace knows “no fear in the face of apparent defeat” and is not “daunted by disappointment,” Leo said. “It takes tenacity to build peace. It takes perseverance to protect and nurture life.”\n \n\n   \n  Leo’s visit will offer support to Lebanon’s sizeable Christian minority, which has ancient roots in the country. The pontiff is due to meet political leaders and young people, take part in an inter-religious gathering and celebrate mass on the Beirut waterfront as part of the second leg of his  first foreign trip  since his election in May.\n \n\n   \n  Large crowds, some holding Lebanese and Vatican flags, lined the streets to welcome the first American pontiff to the presidential palace. More spectators gathered inside palace grounds in the hopes of spotting the pope, donning plastic raincoats under a gray sky.\n \n\n   \n  Leo’s calls for dialogue and unity come at a time of heightened tensions in the region and days after the Israeli strike last week on southern Beirut.\n \n\n   \n  The strike, which targeted Hezbollah’s Chief of Staff, Haytham Ali Tabatabai,  killed five people  and injured 28, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.\n \n\n   \n  Moments before arriving in Beirut, Leo told reporters aboard the papal plane that he had come to Lebanon and  Turkey  – the first port of call on his international trip – as a “messenger” to “promote peace throughout the region.”\n \n\n   \n  He also reiterated the Holy See’s support for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, saying it is the only way to offer a “solution to the conflict they continually live.”\n \n\n   \n  “We seek with both sides to be a mediating voice that can help to draw close to a solution with justice for all,” Leo said in the first in-flight press conference of his papacy.\n \n\n   \n  One stop on Leo’s tour will be the Monastery of Mar Maroun, or Saint Maroun, in the town of Annaya, high in the Lebanese mountains. There, he is expected to pray at the tomb of Charbel Makhlouf, a monk known for bringing people of different faiths together.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanon has 18 officially recognized faiths and sects – including 12 Christian communities – with Shia Muslims now Lebanon’s single largest sect. Leo is due to have private meetings with Christian leaders, as well as with Muslim and Druze leaders.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the final day of his visit, Leo will pray at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion, which left more than 200 people dead and injured at least 6,000 others. He will then depart for Italy’s capital Rome.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, while condemning the use of religion for justifying “war,” Leo  urged Catholics to mobilize  their faith and unify others “regardless of ethnicity, nationality, religion or personal perspectives.”\n \n\n   \n  “We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism,” Leo reflected.\n \n\n   \n  Leo’s trip comes at a tense time, one year after an uneasy truce was established between Israel and Hezbollah through US mediation.\n \n\n   \n  The Vatican has long been engaged in diplomacy in the Middle East, and in 2021 the late Pope Francis hosted Lebanese Christian leaders in the Vatican to address the country’s political crisis. The last papal visit to Lebanon took place in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ben Wedeman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/americas/honduras-presidential-election-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00Z","title":"Hondurans go to the polls in close presidential race under shadow of Trump’s surprise intervention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hondurans cast their ballots in a tightly contested presidential election, with three main candidates—Rixi Moncada, Salvador Nasralla, and Nasry 'Tito' Asfura—competing in a race defined by economic inequality, corruption, and security concerns.

     \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Hondurans began casting ballots Sunday to elect a new president only days after US President Donald Trump intervened in a close race with an endorsement of one candidate and announced that he would pardon a former president.\n \n\n   \n  At a voting site in the capital, the country’s major parties were present outside with tables, banners, flags and music. Several dozen people lined up outside the gate to the neighborhood school and were allowed in about 30 minutes after the official start of voting.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to a new president, voters will elect a new Congress, as well as hundreds of local positions.\n \n\n   \n    Main candidates\n \n\n   \n  Among the five presidential candidates on the ballot, polls indicated three had a chance to win and were finishing in close competition. They are:\n \n\n   \n  1. Rixi Moncada who served as finance and later as defense secretary in the current administration of President Xiomara Castro and is running for the social democrat LIBRE or Liberty and Re-foundation party.\n \n\n   \n  2. Salvador Nasralla, who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the conservative Liberal Party.\n \n\n   \n  3. Former Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry “Tito” Asfura, who carries the mantle of the also conservative National Party.\n \n\n   \n  Moncada promises to “democratize” an economy still defined by extreme wealth and poverty. Nasralla casts himself as the outsider who can clean up the country’s endemic corruption. And Asfura is trying to restore the National Party as a pro-business force tarnished by previous bouts of presidential corruption.\n \n\n   \n    Campaign issues\n \n\n   \n  Honduras’ security situation has improved in recent years as homicides across the region continue to fall, but it still has Central America’s highest homicide rate. Hondurans say security and jobs remain their top priorities, despite an economy that has strengthened during Castro’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  The presidential contest had mostly focused on candidates trading accusations of plans to manipulate the vote until this past week when Trump endorsed Asfura while attacking his opponents, the latest signal of the United States’ renewed interest in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s intervention\n \n\n   \n  Then Trump shocked Hondurans by announcing Friday that he would pardon ex-President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was serving a 45-year sentence in a US prison for helping drug traffickers moving cocaine to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  It was unclear what impact Trump would have on the election, but it was the latest show of the US government’s willingness to directly involve itself in the region and came at a time of already heightened tensions because of the US military buildup in the Caribbean and Trump’s threats against Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Hondurans were left unnerved by the sudden US attention, and hoping at a minimum for a peaceful election.\n \n\n   \n  Walking by a polling site in the capital, Ruben Darío Molina, a 55-year-old security guard, said that he wouldn’t vote Sunday because he had to work. But he had choice words for Trump, whose administration deported him back to his native Honduras a month ago after 20 years living in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  He had worked in landscaping in Miami, but was picked up by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, one day in the street, separating him from his US citizen wife and son.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t believe in politicians,” he said. “Politicians are garbage. They use you like a ladder (to move up).”\n \n\n   \n    Divergent views\n \n\n   \n  Cristian Zelaya, a 42-year-old systems engineer, said that his priority in the voting booth was “to try to rescue the country from a future like Venezuela.” He said that he wanted to get the “Communists” out, in reference to the governing social democrat LIBRE party, which he said made big promises, but didn’t deliver.\n \n\n   \n  He praised Trump’s decision to pardon Hernández, who he considered a good president, but said it had no impact on his decision.\n \n\n   \n  In another part of the capital, Carlos Alberto Figueroa, a 71-year-old retiree, said that he wanted Moncada to continue President Castro’s work, which he said had already resulted in “development, a better economy and security.”\n \n\n   \n  But he too discounted Trump’s impact, saying the Honduran people would decide.\n \n\n   \n  Nancy Serrano, 20, was voting for the first time and top of mind for her was “enough with corruption.”\n \n\n   \n  Serrano is studying to be a teacher and she worries that the high prevalence of corruption limits opportunities for the youth and eats away at the economy.\n \n\n   \n    Election details\n \n\n   \n  In announcing the start of voting Sunday, National Electoral Council President Ana Paola Hall called on the candidates to respect the rules to not declare victory before the council confirms a winner.\n \n\n   \n  Polls are due to close at 5 p.m. local time Sunday. The council planned to provide preliminary results at 9 p.m., but has up to 30 days to officially announce the final result.\n \n\n   \n  More than 4,000 Honduran and foreign election observers had fanned out to the nearly 6,000 polling places across the country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/asia/flooding-senyar-ditwah-indonesia-malaysia-thailand-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"20:05:00-05:00","title":"Deadly storms ravage Asia, killing over 700 with hundreds missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Deadly storms, including Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait and Cyclone Ditwah in Sri Lanka, have caused widespread flooding and landslides across Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia, resulting in over 700 deaths and hundreds missing.

parts of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia this week when a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait – a narrow waterway separating the Indonesian island of Sumatra from the other two nations.\n \n\n   \n  Sri Lanka was struck by a separate storm from which heavy rains are now approaching India’s southern coast.\n \n\n   \n  The severe weather has claimed the lives of at least 435 people in Indonesia, 334 in Sri Lanka, 162 in Thailand and two in Malaysia, officials told the Reuters news agency.\n \n\n   \n    In Indonesia\n \n\n   \n  Indonesian rescue teams are struggling to reach the hardest-hit areas of Sumatra, where Cyclone Senyar caused catastrophic landslides and flooding.\n \n\n   \n  At least 435 people have died, government data on Sunday showed, an increase from 303 on Saturday.

Water levels have almost completely receded, with only some areas remaining flooded,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n    In Sri Lanka\n \n\n   \n  More than half a million people felt the wrath of Cyclone Ditwah, which triggered mud slides and flooding on Friday, Reuters said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 334 people were killed and more than 1.1 million people were affected by the storms, according to a  report  from Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Center.\n \n\n   \n  Over 25,000 homes have been destroyed and 147,000 people have been forced into state-run temporary shelters, AP reported.\n \n\n   \n  Mallika Kumari was among more than 78,000 people moved to relief centers, mostly set up in schools, after her home was quickly submerged, according to the news agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I first heard about the flood warning on TV but we never expected the river to overflow so quickly.

I’ve brought a few garbage bags to collect their clothes.”\n \n\n   \n  In the rush, Kumari left behind her cat, which was later picked up by a navy boat and brought to dry land.\n \n\n   \n  Some 191 people remain missing in Sri Lanka and most homes in low-lying areas near the capital, Colombo, are under water and without power, authorities told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Some residents chose to stay on the upper floors of partially submerged homes to protect their belongings, the outlet said.\n \n\n   \n  Selvi, a 46-year-old resident of Colombo’s Wennawatte suburb, fled her home with four bags of clothes and other possessions. “My house is completely flooded.

Kiffin  has decided to trade the coaching sideline in Oxford, Mississippi for the one in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin announced Sunday he will leave Ole Miss, after guiding the Rebels for six seasons, to coach at Louisiana State University (LSU), a Southeastern Conference (SEC)-foe.\n \n\n   \n  “I made the difficult decision to accept the head coaching position at LSU,” he  posted  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “While I am looking forward to a new start with a unique opportunity at LSU, I will forever cherish the incredible six years I spent at Ole Miss and will be rooting hard for the team to complete their mission and bring a championship to Oxford.”\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin led Ole Miss to their best season in more than six decades. The Rebels are 11-1 which should secure the school’s first  College Football Playoff  (CFP) spot.\n \n\n   \n  The Rebels  named  defensive coordinator Pete Golding head coach. He will guide the team in pursuit of its first national championship in program history.\n \n\n   \n  “Today’s team meeting was a clear indicator of his ability to galvanize our squad. All of our players and coaches are ecstatic and ready to lock arms for a playoff run,” Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The future of Ole Miss Football is brighter than ever, and we look forward to taking the next steps in our program’s journey with Pete Golding at the helm.”\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin preferred to continue to coach Ole Miss into the playoffs, but the school slapped that request down.\n \n\n   \n  “I was hoping to complete a historic six season run with this year’s team by leading Ole Miss through the playoffs, capitalizing on the team’s incredible success and their commitment to finish strong, and investing everything into a playoff run with guardrails in place to protect the program in any areas of concern,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “My request to do so was denied by Keith Carter despite the team also asking him to allow me to keep coaching them so they could better maintain their high level of performance. Unfortunately, that means Friday’s Egg Bowl was my last game coaching the Rebels.”\n \n\n   \n  Later on Sunday, before boarding a plane to Baton Rouge, Kiffin told ESPN’s Marty Smith that it was a “very challenging, difficult day,” saying that he understood the decision made by Carter to not allow him to continue coaching the team through the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  “And at the end of the day, that’s his decision and I totally respect that. I understand that decision,” Kiffin told ESPN.\n \n\n   \n  “I just totally wish the team the best of luck, wish that I was coaching. … I just hope they play really well and go win the national championship.”\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin called the move to switch schools a “family decision.”\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe it’s right, maybe it’s wrong. But I think a lot of times you just go prove things right, and that’s what we’re going to do when we get there,” Kiffin said.\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin also said he didn’t “totally agree” but understood Carter’s decision for him not to attend an Ole Miss team meeting earlier on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ole Miss won its third consecutive Egg Bowl against in-state rival Mississippi State Bulldogs 38-19 in Starkville, Mississippi.\n \n\n   \n  Under Kiffin, the Rebels have won at least 10 games for three consecutive seasons and four of the last five. Ole Miss has appeared in five straight bowl games.\n \n\n   \n  LSU will be Kiffin’s fifth college head coaching job. He previously was at the helm at Tennessee, University of Southern California and Florida Atlantic University before his Ole Miss stint.\n \n\n   \n  In 14 seasons on the collegiate level, Kiffin has complied a 116-53 record, 4-4 in bowl games. He also coached in the NFL where he was 5-15 in one-plus seasons with the then-Oakland Raiders.\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin replaces  Brian Kelly  who was fired in October during the fourth season of a 10-year contract worth $100 million. LSU finished the season 7-5 after a loss to No. 8 Oklahoma on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are thrilled to welcome Coach Kiffin as the next head coach of the LSU Football program,” LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry said in a statement. “Lane is a proven winner who has thrived in an era of college athletics that requires coaches to adapt and innovate.\n \n\n   \n  “His passion, creativity and authenticity make him the ideal leader to guide LSU into the future and consistently position us among the sport’s elite.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision ends a months-long saga that saw rumors of Kiffin going to several schools including the University of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  However, Florida moved on from Kiffin and  named  Tulane’s Jon Sumrall as its next head coach on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin was adament after Friday’s Ole Miss’ game that he had yet to make a decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve got some praying to do to figure this thing out,” he said. “I’m living one day at a time. I know that doesn’t help you, but it helps me.”\n \n\n   \n  While saying he missed his father,  Monte , “in a week like this,” an emotional Kiffin also added that he was planning to consult with former University of Alabama head coach Nick Saban and current Las Vegas Raiders head coach Pete Carroll for advice.\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin detailed what Saban and Carroll said to him while contemplating the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart was here (at Ole Miss),” Kiffin said to ESPN Sunday. “But I talked to some mentors – Coach Carroll, Coach Saban. Especially when Coach Carroll said, ‘Your dad would tell you to go. Take the shot.’\n \n\n   \n  Ole Miss needed a miracle on Saturday - an Auburn win over No. 10 Alabama in the Iron Bowl - to clinch a spot in the SEC championship game.\n \n\n   \n  But the Crimson Tide escaped the upset bid by the Tigers and will face the Georgia next weekend in Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  The CFP selection show is on December 7.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/politics/dc-shooting-suspect-rahmanullah-lakanwal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"06:29:00-05:00","title":"Afghan National Guard Shooting Suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal: Background, Behavior, and Vetting Controversy","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a former CIA operative from Afghanistan who served in a special forces unit known as the Zero Unit, was evacuated to the United States in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome.

November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Afghan man who allegedly shot two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week went from being a US partner in Afghanistan to spending the last few years in Washington state with his family, where, according to reports and sources who spoke to CNN, he had a hard time assimilating and dealt with lingering PTSD.\n \n\n   \n   Rahmanullah Lakanwal  worked with the CIA for over a decade in Afghanistan before the US military withdrew from the country. That work with US forces in Afghanistan led him to come to the US in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  The devastating attack near the White House last week left  one National Guard member dead  and another in critical condition. Lakanwal was wounded during the shooting and taken to the hospital, authorities said. His condition is unknown.\n \n\n   \n  He faces at least one first-degree murder charge, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, told Fox News on Friday, adding, “There are certainly many more charges to come.”\n \n\n   \n  As investigators work to establish a motive for the shooting, they have been piecing together details about Lakanwal’s life. The information that has emerged is largely related to the Afghan national’s interactions with the immigration process. Trump administration officials have criticized the Biden administration in the wake of the shooting, saying Lakanwal  was not sufficiently vetted before  entering the US.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have also learned in interviews with the suspect’s family that Lakanwal may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the case told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  According to the sources, family members told authorities that the PTSD stemmed from the fighting Lakanwal did in Afghanistan, where he fought in a CIA-sponsored-and-trained unit of the Afghan special forces known as a Zero Unit.\n \n\n   \n    Suspect struggled to assimilate\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal appeared to have been unraveling for years, unable to hold a job and flipping between long, lightless stretches of isolation and taking sudden weekslong cross-country drives, emails obtained by The Associated Press indicate. His behavior deteriorated so sharply that a community advocate reached out to a refugee organization for help, fearing he was becoming suicidal.\n \n\n   \n  The emails reveal mounting warnings about the asylum-seeker, whose erratic conduct raised alarms long before the attack that jolted the nation’s capital on Wednesday, the eve of Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  The previously unreported concerns offer the clearest picture yet of how he was struggling in his new life in the United States after arriving through Operation Allies Welcome, a program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of vulnerable Afghans after the American withdrawal. Many had worked alongside US troops and diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal lived in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, according to the Department of Homeland Security. A neighbor, who requested to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CNN his two nephews lived with him as well.\n \n\n   \n  A community member shared with AP emails that had been sent to the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nonprofit group that provides services to refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “Rahmanullah has not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023. He quit his job that month, and his behavior has changed greatly,” the person wrote in a January 2024 email.\n \n\n   \n  The emails AP obtained described a man who was unable to hold a steady job or commit to his English courses while he alternated between “periods of dark isolation and reckless travel.” Sometimes, he spent weeks in his “darkened room, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife or older kids.” At one point in 2023, the family faced eviction after months of not paying rent.\n \n\n   \n  The neighbor who spoke with CNN said that to his knowledge, Lakanwal was unemployed and had been looking for a job.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal’s work history in the US is not entirely clear, but Amazon confirms that a person with the suspect’s name was an independent contractor with the company for one month this summer, working for its Flex delivery service.\n \n\n   \n  A couple of times, when Lakanwal’s wife left him with the kids for a week to travel to visit relatives, the children would not be bathed, their clothes would not be changed, and they would not eat well, the emails AP obtained show. Their school raised concerns about the situation.\n \n\n   \n  But then, there were “interim” weeks where Lakanwal would try to make amends and “do the right things,” according to an email, reengaging with the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services as was mandated by the terms of his entry into the US.\n \n\n   \n  “But that has quickly evolved into ‘manic’ episodes for one or two weeks at a time, where he will take off in the family car, and drive nonstop,” the email outlined. Once, he went to Chicago, and another time, to Arizona.\n \n\n   \n  Pirro said last week that Lakanwal drove across the country from Bellingham, which is about 80 miles north of Seattle, to the nation’s capital.\n \n\n   \n  The community member, in an interview with AP, spoke of becoming worried that Lakanwal was so depressed that he would end up harming himself. But they did not see any indication that Lakanwal would commit violence against another person.\n \n\n   \n  When the community member saw on the news that Lakanwal was named as the suspect in the attack, they told the AP they were stunned, unable to square the violence with the memory of seeing Lakanwal play with his young sons. The person spoke with AP on the condition of anonymity to share undisclosed details while cooperating with the FBI in its investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal’s neighbor told CNN he knew him as a “simple and nice guy,” who attended a local mosque, but added that the suspect had “disappeared” and had not gone to the mosque in over two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “He was not coming … somebody said he’s sick, someone else said he went somewhere,” the neighbor said.\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that officials “believe he was radicalized since he’s been here in this country.” She did not provide details on what that may have entailed.\n \n\n   \n  “We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we’re going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members,” Noem said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘He was clean on all checks’\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal began working with the CIA around 2011, a senior US official told CNN. At the time, the CIA  would have vetted him through  a variety of databases, including the National Counterterrorism Center’s, to see whether he had any known ties to terrorist groups, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  NCTC would have vetted him again for any ties to terrorism before he was allowed into the US in 2021 as part of  Operation Allies Welcome . Lakanwal was part of a prioritized group evacuated from Kabul after the Afghan capital fell to the Taliban. Due to his work for the US, including serving in an elite Afghan counterterrorism unit, Lakanwal was considered to be at risk of retribution once the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  He was clean then as well, and did not show any ties to terror organizations, per the senior US official.\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of vetting, nothing came up,” according to the official. “He was clean on all checks.”\n \n\n   \n  But NCTC Director Joe Kent on Friday said in a  post on X  that while Lakanwal was vetted to work with the US government in Afghanistan, he was “NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  Once Lakanwal was evacuated, he went through multiple layers of vetting by multiple US government agencies, sources told CNN — first in a Middle Eastern country, according to one source familiar with the matter, and then regularly over the past few years while he was residing in the US.\n \n\n   \n  A Justice Department audit, the results of which were released in June, found no systemic breakdowns in the process established to screen and vet Afghan evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  But the audit acknowledged that “the normal processes required to determine whether individuals posed a threat to national security and public safety were overtaken by the need to immediately evacuate and protect the lives of Afghans, increasing the potential that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation.”\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal would have also been vetted after he applied for asylum in 2024. It was granted in April, during the Trump administration. Noem on Sunday told NBC, “The vetting process all happened under (former President) Joe Biden’s administration.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Miller, Zachary Cohen, Evan Perez, Kristen Holmes, Lex Harvey, Chelsea Bailey, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Andy Rose, Sarah Moon and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/weather/winter-snow-storm-travel-forecast","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"18:41:00-05:00","title":"Cross-country winter storm disrupts post-Thanksgiving travel in the Midwest, and another system is behind it","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful cross-country winter storm, originating in the Rockies and moving through the Midwest, disrupted post-Thanksgiving travel with widespread snow, ice, and rain.

Meteorologist Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:41 PM EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Emerging from their holiday food comas and shuffling toward the nation’s airports and highways, some Americans may discover the biggest holiday indigestion has nothing to do with pie. A potent storm is muscling into the journey home, threatening to upend post-turkey travel.\n \n\n   \n  For anyone who postponed their return holiday travel to Monday or Tuesday, thinking that would make things easier, Mother Nature may have other plans.\n \n\n   \n  A storm that moved through the Rockies on Friday morphed into a full-blown, cross-country storm, placing around 49 million people in the North under winter weather alerts over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The storm is opening the door for a  new, colder rush  of frigid Arctic air that will send temperatures plummeting for millions right before the calendar flips to December.\n \n\n   \n  Some air passengers are facing travel woes, with more than 700 US flights canceled and more than 9,400 flights delayed as of Sunday afternoon,  according to FlightAware .\n \n\n   \n  Those cancellations follow the more than 1,900 US flights canceled Saturday, mostly due to winter weather in the Midwest.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the disruptions are in the Windy City, which has seen steady snow. More than 280 flights to and from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport were canceled as of Sunday afternoon and more than 1,300 flights were delayed, according to  FlightAware . Amid a recorded 8.4 inches of snow Saturday – a new maximum snowfall record for November – the airport saw more than 1,100 flight cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  As delays persisted in Chicago through midday Sunday, they increased in New York City and Boston due to a combination of low ceilings, high winds and overall holiday traveler volume.\n \n\n   \n  Iowa’s Des Moines International Airport  resumed operations  Sunday afternoon after closing when a Delta Connection flight, operated by Endeavor Air, arriving from Detroit, slid off the runway amid icy conditions on the ground Saturday night.\n \n\n   \n  The flight carrying two pilots, two flight attendants and 54 passengers “left the paved surface while transitioning from the runway to the taxiway,” Delta Air Lines said in a statement, confirming there were no injuries and all passengers were offered compensation.\n \n\n   \n  Pre-holiday weather already proved deadly in Minnesota. A 69-year-old man was killed after being crushed by a snow-covered tree Wednesday morning amid strong winds in Alden Township, around 180 miles northeast of Minneapolis,  CNN affiliate WCCO  reported, citing the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  This post-Turkey Day storm could unleash similar dangers.\n \n\n   \n    Tracking the storm\n \n\n   \n  The storm pushed into the Pacific Northwest on Thursday night and moved through the Rockies Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The center of the storm moved out of the Plains early Saturday morning and strengthened throughout the day as it spread eastward through the Midwest, bringing snow, rain and even some icy mix over much of the nation’s midsection.\n \n\n   \n  Rain will fall on the southern side of the storm, but snow is in the forecast on the north side, which took aim at Nebraska and Kansas and northward through the Midwest. Some areas caught near the transition between mostly snow and mostly rain will deal with an icy mix for a time. Winds will also increase as the storm strengthens.\n \n\n   \n  Areas east of the Mississippi River will have to deal with the storm on Sunday — snow for the Great Lakes and rain stretching through the South — while the country’s midsection gets blasted by Arctic air on its backside.\n \n\n   \n  The storm will move away from the East Coast late Sunday evening.\n \n\n   \n    The wintry side\n \n\n   \n  Widespread accumulating snow will stretch from the Rockies to Appalachia to close out November, and will be the first storm so far this season to accomplish the feat.\n \n\n   \n  Early Saturday afternoon, Iowa State Patrol had already seen the number of vehicle crashes starting to grow and rescued close to 200 people from ditches across the state, Sgt. Alex Dinkla told CNN. “Road conditions are absolutely deteriorating very quickly,” he said, noting state Department of Transportation snowplows were having a tough time keeping roads cleared.\n \n\n   \n  “So if you don’t have to travel, please don’t, and stay home or stay with friends if you can. But if you do have to travel, we want you to take it easy,” Illinois Department of Transportation Secretary Gia Biagi told CNN’s Omar Jimenez on Saturday. “Move slowly and know that it’s going to take us a day or two to even clean up from the storm.”\n \n\n   \n  In Indiana, a pileup involving 35 cars and 10 semitrucks shut down Interstate 70, an important east–west thoroughfare, for five hours near Terre Haute Saturday afternoon, according to Indiana State Police Sgt. Matt Ames.\n \n\n   \n  “There were 11 people transported off the interstate by ambulance,” Ames said in an email to CNN. “No major injuries only complaint of pain.”\n \n\n   \n    The rainy side\n \n\n   \n  Rain could also disrupt holiday travel south of the snowy areas. Rain and a few thunderstorms could produce localized flash flooding in parts of the South.\n \n\n   \n  Portions of the Southeast will see rain showers Sunday from this system before it finally moves offshore late Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  This rain is less likely to cause flash flooding issues, but could cause slow-going travel for anyone driving in the area.\n \n\n   \n  Early Monday morning, a new system will begin to take shape and strengthen over the Ark-La-Tex region, bringing more rain and snow to areas hit over the weekend. It will also bring snow to areas in the Ohio River and Tennessee Valley that didn’t see any snow this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  As this new system moves east, it will spread snow into the Northeast and New England. There could also be significant icing in the Appalachians – a tricky forecast that will be fine-tuned in the days to come.\n \n\n   \n  Des Moines, St. Louis and Chicago are just a few of the places forecast to pick up additional snow Monday. Heavy rain is also expected for much of the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions.\n \n\n   \n  There is a level 1 out of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Monday, including in Houston, New Orleans and Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n    Winter air is coming\n \n\n   \n  The new round of significant temperature drops started Saturday in the Rockies and Plains as Arctic air plunges into the US behind the storm. High temperatures in the teens and low 20s are likely as far south as Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  Temperatures will sink to downright frigid levels overnight into early Sunday morning. Low temperatures will be in the single digits in much of the north-central US and dip below freezing all the way into northern Texas.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s high temperatures will be 15 to 20 degrees colder than typical for much of the central US. Some parts of the Midwest could end up with highs stuck well below freezing, closer to 30 degrees colder than normal.\n \n\n   \n  The cold air will expand east with overnight low temperatures at or below freezing expected in most of the Lower 48. Parts of Montana, the Dakotas and the Upper Midwest could wake up to temperatures several degrees below zero on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  December marks the start of meteorological winter — which runs through February — and it will certainly feel like it well into the first week of the season. Monday and Tuesday will remain quite frigid for millions of people before temperatures start to shift back closer to normal midweek.\n \n\n   \n  The upcoming Arctic blast could be a preview of more cold to come deeper into December from a disruption of the  polar vortex .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/middleeast/netanyahu-pardon-israel-president-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"07:23:00-05:00","title":"Israeli PM Netanyahu requests pardon in ongoing corruption trial","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formally requested a pardon from President Isaac Herzog in his ongoing corruption trial, arguing that it is in the public interest to heal national divisions and restore trust in institutions.

His office confirmed it received the request, and Herzog would “consider it with great care and responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  In the one-page letter, Netanyahu does not include an admission of guilt or make any commitments about his political future. He has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n \n\n   \n  The formal request for a pardon is a reversal for the long-time Israeli leader, who has said the indictments would collapse and that he would prove his innocence in court.\n \n\n   \n  “Faced with the security challenges and diplomatic opportunities currently before the State of Israel, I am committed to do everything in my power to heal the rifts, achieve national unity, and restore public trust in the state’s institutions,” Netanyahu wrote, “and I expect all branches of government to do the same.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Only someone guilty asks for a pardon’\n \n\n   \n  The opposition were quick to criticize the request from Netanyahu who has faced accusations of stoking rifts within Israeli society – against the Arab population and the left in particular – as well as prolonging the war in Gaza for his own political gain.\n \n\n   \n  Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s opposition, urged Herzog to reject the pardon request, at least in its current form. “You cannot grant Netanyahu a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse, and an immediate withdrawal from political life,” Lapid said in a video statement.\n \n\n   \n  Head of the left-wing Democrats party Yair Golan said on X, “Only someone guilty asks for a pardon. After eight years of trial, when the cases against him have not collapsed, Netanyahu is now asking for a pardon.”\n \n\n   \n  But Netanyahu’s political allies came out in favor of the pardon. Far-right Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir supported the request, saying in a statement it is “critical for the security for the security of the state.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump once again weighed in on the case with his own letter to Israel’s president, asking for a pardon for arguably his most vocal international cheerleader.\n \n\n   \n  “I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace,” Trump wrote in a letter distributed by the Israeli president’s spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  A Channel 12 poll conducted in mid-November after Trump’s letter to Herzog suggested that 48% of the Israeli public oppose an unconditional pardon, while 44% support it. The remaining 8% said they did not know.\n \n\n   \n  According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the president’s pardon authority in Israel is subject to his broad discretion. But, in general, pardons are only issued after an individual has already been convicted.\n \n\n   \n  “The possibility that the President might pardon someone before or during trial risks turning the President into an authority that bypasses the law-enforcement and judicial system,” wrote Dana Blander, a research fellow at the institute. “The rule is that the President acts as a ‘compassionate authority’ only after all other authorities have spoken.”\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of Israel to face criminal prosecution while in office. His trial began in May 2020 in three separate cases.\n \n\n   \n  In  the most serious case  he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $250 million at the time to his friend Shaul Elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company Bezeq. In return, the prosecution claims, Elovitch ensured positive coverage of the prime minister in an online news site he owned called Walla! News. Elovitch has denied the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. Given the remaining stages of the trial, which include testimony, judgment and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years.\n \n\n   \n  There is no deadline for Herzog to make a decision regarding a pardon.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/us/brian-walshe-trial-ana-case","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-05:00","title":"After surprise guilty plea to lesser charges, Brian Walshe goes on trial for wife’s murder","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, facing a life sentence if convicted of first-degree murder, is set to go on trial in Dedham, Massachusetts, following a surprise guilty plea to lesser charges involving the illegal disposal of his wife Ana Walshe’s body and misleading police.

EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A jury in a suburban town south of Boston is set to hear  the murder case against Brian Walshe  in the death of his wife, Ana Walshe, nearly three years after her disappearance garnered national attention.\n \n\n   \n  In a stunning move on the first day of jury selection earlier this month, Walshe admitted that he illegally disposed of Ana’s body and misled police after her disappearance. He did not admit to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  After  pleading guilty to two of the three counts against him , Walshe still faces a life sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, a real estate manager and the mother of their three young children.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team is expected to reveal its trial strategy in opening statements scheduled to begin Monday morning in Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham, Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search for Ana Walshe, 39, was launched after her employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, and her husband told investigators he’d last seen her leaving their Cohasset home for a work trip on New Year’s Day.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died and her body was never found.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day to explain how he could’ve disposed of her body without being responsible for her death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe acknowledged his wife was dead when he pleaded guilty to illegally disposing of her body – a fact that was not officially established before the shocking plea change on November 18.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have said they will argue that Walshe planned to kill his wife, warranting the first-degree murder charge he faces.\n \n\n   \n  If the defense wants to explain Ana’s death at trial, it’s likely Walshe will testify, Harvard law professor Ronald Sullivan said in an interview with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s the only way you’re going to get his story in evidence, if he testifies … unless there’s some secret witness,” Sullivan said. “You can imagine some set of circumstances where he wouldn’t, but the strong likelihood is that he has to in order to spin this theory.”\n \n\n   \n  If Walshe testifies, it’ll be up to the jury to decide if he’s a credible witness, Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  “He gets to testify to that, right, because there are no contrary facts there and, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence. The jury can credit it or not credit it, but that’s on the record at (that) point.”\n \n\n   \n  The problem with defense strategies like that, according to Sullivan, is there’s no corroboration for the defendant’s story.\n \n\n   \n  According to court records Walshe used his young son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  When the search for Ana pointed law enforcement to her husband, investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items Walshe allegedly threw away, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card, according to court documents.    \n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home, prosecutors have said.   \n \n\n   \n  The commonwealth has suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife to cash in on substantial life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to a federal art fraud conviction he was dealing with at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Jurors are also expected to hear about Ana Walshe’s ongoing affair with a man in Washington, DC, through their text messages and from his own trial testimony.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say Brian Walshe could have been motivated to kill his wife over the extramarital romantic entanglement.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys have argued there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But pretrial court records allege Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   \n  The judge may limit some trial evidence about Brian Walshe’s acts to dispose of Ana’s body in the wake of his guilty pleas. And the commonwealth’s witness list will also likely be trimmed because they won’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  The trial – now expected to take two to three weeks – was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Diane Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n   Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial November 14 after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys also have argued he can’t get a fair trial in the jurisdiction because of continued prolific media coverage, but the judge denied a defense motion to move the trial to another area in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  A panel of 12 and four alternates was seated November 20 after a three-day selection process. Freniere opted to begin the evidentiary portion of the trial after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news and media to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n  Karen Read’s controversial trials were held in the same courthouse,  drawing crowds of her supporters  that at times could be heard in the building.\n \n\n   \n  Though Walshe faces a first-degree murder charge, his attorneys could ask Freniere to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges before the jury begins deliberating.\n \n\n   \n  First-degree murder carries a mandatory life prison term without parole eligibility, but a conviction on a lesser charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter could give 50-year-old Walshe the hope for an eventual release.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe could see up to 10 years in prison for the one count of misleading police he pleaded guilty to, which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, a defendant cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder. Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a  37-month prison sentence  tied to a federal case from 2018, in which he pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jean Casarez contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/europe/switzerland-women-national-service-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"08:48:00-05:00","title":"Swiss Voters Reject Mandatory National Service for Women","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Swiss voters rejected a proposal to require all women to participate in mandatory national service — such as in military, civil protection, or environmental and social roles — and also turned down a plan to impose a 50% tax on donations or inheritances over 50 million francs to fund climate action.

Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:48 AM EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n   Swiss  voters on Sunday decisively rejected a call to require women to do national service in the military, civil protection teams or other forms, as all men must do already.\n \n\n   \n  Official results, with counting still ongoing in some areas after a referendum, showed that more than half of Switzerland’s cantons, or states, had rejected the “citizen service initiative” by wide margins. That meant it was defeated, because proposals need a majority of both voters and cantons to pass.\n \n\n   \n  Voters also heavily rejected a separate proposal to impose a new national tax on individual donations or  inheritances  of more than 50 million francs ($62 million), with the revenues to be used to fight the impact of  climate change  and help Switzerland meet its ambitions to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the national service plan hoped that it would boost social cohesion by adding jobs in areas like environmental prevention, food security and elderly care.\n \n\n   \n  But lawmakers opposed it, mainly for cost reasons and out of concern that it could hurt the economy by taking many young people out of the workforce.\n \n\n   \n  The national service proposal came at a time when other European countries are finding ways to bolster their armed forces in the face of growing concerns about Russia’s potential threat beyond the  war in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  Young men in neutral Switzerland are already required to carry out military service or join civil protection teams. Conscientious objectors can do other types of service, and those who opt out entirely must pay an exemption fee. Each year, about 35,000 men take part in mandatory service.\n \n\n   \n  The failed initiative would have required all Swiss citizens to do national service — women can currently do so on a voluntary basis — and applied the concept of national security to areas beyond military service or civil protection.\n \n\n   \n  Its supporters pointed to “landslides in the mountains, floods in the plains, cyberattacks, risks of energy shortages or war in Europe” and said that their plan would mean everyone taking responsibility for “a stronger Switzerland that’s able to stand up to crises.”\n \n\n   \n  The government countered that the army and civil defense have enough staff, and no more people should be recruited than are needed.\n \n\n   \n  While compulsory military service for women might be seen as “a step toward  gender equality ,” it added, the idea would “place an extra burden on many women, who already shoulder a large part of the unpaid work of raising and caring for children and relatives, as well as household tasks.”\n \n\n   \n  The government also opposed the proposal for a new tax on large donations or inheritances, arguing that approval could prod some of the wealthiest in Switzerland — an estimated 2,500 people — to move elsewhere. Sums beyond 50 million francs ($62 million) could have been hit with a 50% rate.\n \n\n   \n  Switzerland holds national referendums four times a year, giving voters a direct say in policymaking.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/politics/trump-one-big-beautiful-bill-rural-healthcare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-04:00","title":"How life changed in a rural town that lost its clinic after Trump’s megabill","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The closure of the Churchville, Virginia health clinic, attributed to provisions in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has left residents—many of whom rely on doorstep medical care—struggling to access basic health services.

Mystic shop just a few feet from the shuttered clinic. Leach, who has asthma, said she voted for Trump last year.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are hoping to make health care a defining issue nationally in next year’s midterms. But the environment in Churchville illustrates the challenges the party faces, particularly in rural communities.\n \n\n   \n  Trump carried Augusta County, which includes Churchville, by nearly 50 points in 2024. Jena Crisler, a physician, ran to represent the area in the Virginia House of Delegates and lost this month to the Republican incumbent by more than 40 points even in a Democratic statewide sweep.\n \n\n   \n  A woman sitting in the same coffee shop whispered under her breath that she supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. It takes her over an hour to visit her doctors in Charlottesville. Rural health care is always precarious, she says, and the clinic closure was especially a blow for her husband.\n \n\n   \n  But she said she wouldn’t put up a sign for a Democrat “because of the environment,” and she declined to be named by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Across the street from the coffee shop, a sign in the window of a storefront reads, “Thank you, Trump, Save America Again.”\n \n\n   \n    How the Trump megabill affected rural health care\n \n\n   \n  Rural health providers that rely on Medicaid funding were already under strain before the bill cut federal health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, primarily by instituting work requirements and more eligibility checks.\n \n\n   \n  Lynlee Thorne, political director of Rural Ground Game, a group focused on driving up Democratic participation in rural areas, says Democrats will continue highlighting the significance of accessible health care through town hall-style events and canvassing, trying to win back credibility and trust in rural America.\n \n\n   \n  “I think people have an interest in having real conversations about what’s going on with their lives, and there’s really nothing that can replace that person to person at your doorstep conversation,” Thorne said.\n \n\n   \n  Crisler knew she faced long odds when she took on incumbent Delegate Chris Runion in the state’s 35th district. She suggests her race was less about the outcome and more about the need for Democrats to show up everywhere instead of simply surrendering communities where they’re outnumbered.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they are very concerned, and they’re going to be even more when it starts hitting them personally,” said Crisler of the clinic closures.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Runion said he was not available for comment.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to US Rep. Ben Cline, a Republican who represents the area in Washington and voted for the Trump policy bill. His office did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Pediatrician Mark Downey defeated incumbent Republican Chad Green in the state’s 69th district, which includes Newport News, York, James City and Gloucester counties. In an interview with CNN, he said it’s important Democrats continue to run on health care even if the message does not immediately resonate with voters.\n \n\n   \n  “It may not happen overnight. People’s minds don’t change right away, but when they start seeing loss of access, loss of services, eventually there’s going to be a situation where it’s not going to be as convenient for them or more of a hardship for them,” said Downey, who had made two previous unsuccessful tries for the state legislature.\n \n\n   \n    Some people are speaking out\n \n\n   \n  Irene Holmes, 59, moved to Churchville three years ago. When her son died, she and her husband wanted a change of scenery from New York. Beset with a host of medical challenges from liver issues to high blood pressure, she relied on and valued the town clinic.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a mixed bag of tricks, a lot of medical issues,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  On politics, she tends to “keep her mouth shut” to avoid getting into it with her neighbors. But when asked if Trump was to blame for the clinic closure, Holmes said, “Absolutely.”\n \n\n   \n  “What he’s done is destroying rural areas,” said Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  Dale White, a Churchville resident and church administrator, says the concerns about the clinic are overblown.\n \n\n   \n  “These are old-time rural farming folks, and they’ve been going to get medical care in Staunton and Fishersville, Waynesboro and Charlottesville since they can remember,” said White.\n \n\n   \n  Back at the MTN. Mystic coffeehouse, shop owner Dane Buse suggests now is the time for rural communities to get creative.\n \n\n   \n  “To lose the clinic is the same as losing a grocery store or a local provider,” Buse said.\n \n\n   \n  He suggested the community could band together to find a doctor to make house calls.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe that would fit the bill for us,” Buse said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/politics/vaccine-approval-process-fda-official","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00.000-05:00","title":"FDA Official Plans to Change Vaccine Approval Process, Claiming That Covid-19 Shots Caused Child Deaths","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A senior FDA official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, has announced plans to overhaul the U.S. vaccine approval process, claiming that Covid-19 vaccinations contributed to the deaths of 10 children.

He also claimed that Covid-19 “was never highly lethal for children” and that the effects of it “are comparable” to respiratory viruses for which there aren’t annual vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no doubt that many vaccines have saved millions of lives globally, and many have benefits that far exceed risks, but vaccines are like any other medical product,” Prasad said. “The right drug given to the right patient at the right time is great, but the same drug can be inappropriately given, causing harm.”\n \n\n   \n  Prasad said as a result of the FDA analysis, the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines that will require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed. Among the changes would be stricter requirements for authorization of vaccines used for pregnant women and trials for pneumonia vaccines that will need to prove the shots reduce disease, instead of showing that the vaccine produces enough antibodies to fight the illness.\n \n\n   \n  The agency will also “revise the annual flu vaccine framework,” Prasad said, and “will re-appraise safety and be honest in vaccine labels.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Prasad’s memo didn’t provide details about how the process would change, it could require larger studies that take longer to complete, slowing the process significantly.\n \n\n   \n  In the memo, Prasad said he’s open to discussion about the changes but said such debates should be internal to the FDA. “Some staff may not agree with these core principles and operating principles,” he wrote before urging those staffers to submit their resignation letters.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the agency, for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s memo is in line with arguments long made by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines and previously founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense.\n \n\n   \n  As the HHS secretary, Kennedy has  slashed funding  for mRNA vaccine development,  removed all members  of the vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and  directed the CDC  to change its website to  include false claims  that link autism and vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, handpicked by Kennedy, is set to meet next week to discuss the childhood vaccine schedule and the timing of the hepatitis B vaccine, according to a  draft agenda  of the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  For more than 30 years, the first in the series of hepatitis B shots has been recommended for infants shortly after birth — a strategy that nearly eradicated the potentially fatal disease among children in the US. Although there is no new evidence about the vaccine’s safety or effectiveness, the new advisory panel has been considering whether to delay the first shots by months or years.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jamie Gumbrecht contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/business/making-financial-gifts-to-adult-children-grandchildren","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"When it makes sense to help your adult kids financially — and when it doesn’t","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article offers practical, expert advice for parents on when and how to financially assist their adult children, emphasizing balance between emotional support and financial responsibility.

Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Spending the holidays with your adult children and the grandkids?\n \n\n   \n  If so, their futures may be on your mind, especially if you sense – or they just flat-out say – they’re not flush enough to buy a home, put their own kids through school, or pay off big debts they’ve acquired.\n \n\n   \n  As a parent, you may wonder if you should help them or if it makes more sense to stay out of it and leave them money after you die, if that’s an option.\n \n\n   \n  To figure out what is right for you, here are four questions to consider:\n \n\n   \n    1. Can I afford to help?\n \n\n   \n  Think carefully about how much you can comfortably offer.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s understandable to want to support your children. (But) balance that emotion with whether you can afford it,” said Rob Williams, head of Financial Planning and Wealth Management Research at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n \n\n   \n  Consider your cash inflow and your spend rate along with how much of a cushion you’ll need to handle unexpected medical expenses or long-term care, said Dawn Jinsky, a certified financial planner and a partner at Plante Moran.\n \n\n   \n  If money is tight, Jinsky noted, it’s okay to say, “We really want to but can’t right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Or maybe you feel you can afford to give money now, just not on a regular basis. So set expectations. “Frame it as a one-time gift,” Jinsky said.\n \n\n   \n    2. If I help one child, what about the others?\n \n\n   \n  Your children’s financial circumstances won’t be identical and you may be considering helping the one who currently has the greatest need.\n \n\n   \n  But if your goal is to be fair to your other kids, too, you can do that in ways that don’t require you to part with more money now.\n \n\n   \n  Say you have three kids and plan to give one $50,000 today. You might amend your estate documents to make sure the other two children each get $50,000 more after you’re gone, Jinsky suggested.\n \n\n   \n  But you might want to explain that to all three kids. “Communication is key when it comes to family dynamics,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    3. Is it better to give money to my kids before I die?\n \n\n   \n  Assuming you will have what you need to live comfortably, there are three potentially good reasons to give your offspring money while you’re alive.\n \n\n   \n  First, they may benefit more from financial help in their earlier adult years than, say, in their 60s, assuming you die decades from now. “Your dollars may have more of an impact when given during your lifetime rather than upon your passing,” Jinsky said.\n \n\n   \n  Second, it gives you an opportunity to support them in ways that are meaningful to you.\n \n\n   \n  “Anchor a gift in your values. Your money speaks for you. Make sure it says what you mean,” said Williams. When his own father became ill, he wanted to give money to his grandchildren and wanted it used for education, so he set up 529 plans for them. But he also wrote each child a personal note, expressing how proud he was of them and how important education had been in his life. “It was the happiest I’ve seen him. He died three months later,” Williams said.\n \n\n   \n  Third, if your estate is large and likely subject to tax after death in your state, if not at the federal level (where individuals can  exempt  up to $13.99 million this year and $15 million next year) giving gifts can reduce your taxable estate.\n \n\n   \n    4. Should I bail my adult child out of a bad financial situation?\n \n\n   \n  If you have an adult child who regularly overspends, mismanages loans or has an  addiction , think hard before helping.\n \n\n   \n  You might  ﻿ not want to bail them out if doing so would just reinforce their bad habits. “In an ideal world, you’re supporting assets and not repairing liabilities,” Williams said. “Generosity ideally doesn’t create dependency.”\n \n\n   \n  But you might want to help if part of your child’s predicament isn’t necessarily their fault – for instance, they’re saddled with unexpected  medical debt  or have a disability.\n \n\n   \n  If you do decide to help but worry the money won’t be handled well, you can pay a given expense directly.\n \n\n   \n  “Look for as many avenues that you can to benefit the child but not put financial means into their hands,” Jinsky said.\n \n\n   \n    Savvy ways to give\n \n\n   \n   Make an annual gift:  In any given year you may give up to a certain amount – it’s $19,000 this year and next – to as many individuals as you choose. That amount doubles to $38,000 if you’re making the gift with your spouse.\n \n\n   \n  The money is tax-free to the recipient. And so long as the amount you give to any one person doesn’t exceed the $19,000 cap, it won’t count against your federal lifetime  gift tax exemption  – which is as high as the estate tax exemption.\n \n\n   \n  If your gift does exceed the cap, but you’re nowhere near maxing out your lifetime exemption amount, you won’t owe tax on the excess but you will have to file a  gift tax return .\n \n\n   \n  Note that once you give the money you cannot control how it will be used.  “The most difficult part for parents in gifting that amount is a little bit of ‘Let go and let God,’” Jinsky said.\n \n\n   \n   Pay expenses directly:  The bill you pay for your child’s or grandchild’s medical or educational expenses does not count as a gift. “Parents can make payments of any amounts directly to the institution if it is for education or medical expenses,” Jinsky said.\n \n\n   \n  But any other money you use to pay their expenses – eg, your child’s mortgage or credit card debt – will count as a gift and is   subject to the now-$19,000 annual exclusion.\n \n\n   \n   Establish a trust:  A  trust  is a more complicated way to gift money, Jinsky noted. But it can be designed to pay out in ways best tailored to your adult child’s or grandchild’s circumstance and to protect the assets in it from being drained. For instance, if the adult child is in a bad marriage, has creditors chasing them or has special needs.\n \n\n   \n  “Typically, the purpose of the trust is for the parent to name a trustee to retain control over the assets to protect and preserve them,” she said. “In many instances a parent will choose to never have the trust distribute outright but instead remain intact for the child’s entire lifetime.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/politics/snap-benefits-work-requirements-changes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"SNAP Benefits Are Flowing Again, But Many Enrollees Will Soon Hit Another Hurdle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. is seeing a resumption of SNAP benefits after a government shutdown, but many recipients face a looming threat of losing food assistance due to newly expanded work requirements under the Republican-led 'One Big Beautiful Bill' signed into law by President Donald Trump.

enrollees will soon hit another hurdle \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Food stamp recipients are now receiving their  November benefits , but a growing swath of enrollees may soon lose their vital food assistance completely.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time as the government shutdown  disrupted  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, states began implementing an expansion of the program’s work requirements as mandated in the  Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill ,” which was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Under the GOP package, more food stamp enrollees will have to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month or they will only be able to receive benefits for three months out of every three years.\n \n\n   \n  The expanded work requirements will result in 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps benefits in an average month over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. This includes 300,000 families with children.\n \n\n   \n  Recipients who don’t meet the requirement will likely start losing their benefits in March, but the timing will depend on where they live and when they must recertify their eligibility for food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have long wanted to beef up SNAP’s existing work requirement, which used to apply to beneficiaries ages 18 to 49 who did not have disabilities or dependent children. The GOP increased the age threshold to 54 as part of the 2023 debt ceiling agreement.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP spending bill further broadened the work requirement to include recipients through age 64 and parents of children ages 14 through 17. Veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster youth are now also subject to the mandate.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the legislation made it harder for states to seek waivers during poor economic conditions. Previously, states could obtain waivers in areas they identify as having a lack of sufficient jobs. Now, only areas with unemployment rates over 10% qualify.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Rhode Island has temporarily barred the US Department of Agriculture from terminating existing waivers before their expiration dates, but the agency has yet to release guidance on the decision, said Chloe Green, assistant director of policy at the American Public Human Services Association.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the case, the USDA said it is approving waivers “within its statutory authority under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025, on an individual basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Overall, roughly double the number of SNAP recipients will be subject to the mandate, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n \n\n   \n  The rollout of the expanded work requirements, however, has been chaotic, which was exacerbated by the record-long government shutdown, states officials and experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “There is both a tremendous amount of confusion and, strangely, a wide array of differences across states and how they are implementing it,” Bauer said.\n \n\n   \n    Rushed timetable\n \n\n   \n  The SNAP work requirement provisions were among the few GOP agenda bill measures that did not have a set implementation date. In the fall, the US Department of Agriculture published guidance that said the new rules took effect on July 4, when the bill was  signed into law,  but effectively gave states until November 1 to stand up their programs.\n \n\n   \n  Then, earlier this month, the USDA said that states should not count November when calculating whether enrollees are meeting their work requirements because of the  shutdown-spurred benefit disruptions .\n \n\n   \n  Most states set November 1 as their implementation date, though some started earlier, Green said. But other states say their systems may not be ready to track the expanded requirement until the spring, even though that could put them at risk for being penalized by the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  “One worry we have is that when you make systems changes this fast, there’s a risk for unintended impacts somewhere else in the system,” she said, noting that such updates usually take 12 to 18 months to do properly.\n \n\n   \n  States are particularly sensitive to making payment mistakes now because another provision of the Republican agenda bill requires that they shoulder a larger share of the program’s administrative costs if they have high error rates.\n \n\n   \n  Beneficiaries who may be newly subject to the work requirements need to be notified and screened to make sure they don’t qualify for other exemptions, such as having physical or mental limitations.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people who are calling in are worried that now they’re being assigned work requirements without them even knowing,” Green said. “That should not happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Many states are starting the three-month clock when residents first apply for food stamps or when they file their recertification forms, which generally happens every six to 12 months depending on the state and entails an interview. But some states are checking all their enrollees at once, without waiting for their recertification dates.\n \n\n   \n    Updating systems\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut has found it “very challenging” to implement the expanded work requirements, said Dan Giacomi, director of program oversight and grants administration at the state’s Department of Social Services. An estimated 36,000 residents — or 10% of the state’s SNAP enrollees — could be at risk of losing their benefits in coming months because of the law’s changes.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t just flip a switch in your eligibility system and have it do all of these new categories or new processes you have,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure it is complying with the Republican agenda bill the state has had to implement temporary workarounds — which involve case workers manually inputting whether recipients are newly subject to the requirement — while it races to update its technology. Giacomi is also concerned about these cases being integrated properly into the system once it is updated, as well as any payment errors that may result in penalties for the state.\n \n\n   \n  Another reason for the delay is that the state had to wait for guidance from the USDA so staffers knew how to handle all scenarios, he said. Though it still has several outstanding questions, it has enough information to get started.\n \n\n   \n  States often want to wait for clear USDA guidance so they don’t take steps that the agency might later say don’t comply with the regulations, said Ed Bolen, director of state SNAP strategies for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, the timetable began even earlier because its economic waivers, which covered many counties and localities, expired in September. The commonwealth took “substantial steps” to connect with all the SNAP recipients in these areas to determine if they could qualify for another exemption from the work requirements, Hoa Pham, a deputy secretary in the Department of Human Services, said. If they don’t qualify, they could start losing their benefits as soon as January 1 unless they meet the work mandate.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania has several ways of verifying recipients’ income, including state and federal data and a pilot program in which enrollees allow a third-party platform to pull and report their payroll information. But these sources don’t necessarily cover all the work that recipients perform so they may also have to submit pay stubs.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the GOP agenda bill, fewer than 25,000 of Pennsylvania’s roughly 1 million SNAP enrollees were subject to the work requirement rules that applied to those ages 18 to 54. The legislation expanded that number to just under 248,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  The department projects that a total of 144,000 recipients could lose their benefits over the next year when they renew their eligibility.\n \n\n   \n  States are also racing to inform SNAP beneficiaries who may now be subject to the work requirements to make sure they meet the mandate or file for exemptions.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut is sending text messages, mailing notices and meeting with community groups. It has also set up an online questionnaire that will direct those potentially affected to the next steps they have to take. Pennsylvania has launched a website — with a video and a screener — to explain the changes to residents.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Pham is worried that some people who would continue to qualify could lose their benefits because of the paperwork.\n \n\n   \n  “It is all too easy for someone to miss an action step, and for that reason alone, that opens up the risk for people to lose their SNAP eligibility — for just missing an administrative process, and not because they are not otherwise eligible,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/26/asia/hong-kong-apartment-fire-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"09:31:00-05:00","title":"Hong Kong mourns as rescuers comb ruined buildings for bodies following deadly blaze","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly fire broke out in the Wang Fuk Court public housing complex in Hong Kong’s Tai Po neighborhood on November 15, 2025, starting in Wang Cheong House and rapidly spreading to seven of eight tower blocks due to flammable materials such as polystyrene boards and combustible scaffolding.

buildings for bodies following deadly blaze. Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Catherine Nicholls, Chris Lau, Jadyn Beverley Sham and Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:31 AM EST, Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A deadly inferno tore   through a massive housing complex in Hong Kong earlier this week, killing at least   146   people with many still missing, in  the city’s worst disaster in decades .\n \n\n   \n  About 40 people are still thought to be missing. Authorities previously put the missing toll at 150, but revised this number down after some of the missing were found among the dead and hospitalized.\n \n\n   \n  Questions are swirling on how such a fire in a skyscraper-filled city with a usually strong public safety record and construction standards could become so deadly, leaping from building to building.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the more than 4,000 people who lived in the   public housing estate in the city’s Tai Po neighborhood were aged 65 and over.\n \n\n   \n  The exact cause of the fire is not yet known, but a criminal investigation has been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The complex was under renovation and encased in bamboo scaffolding and safety netting – a construction technique that’s ubiquitous in Hong Kong and parts of mainland China. Authorities are also investigating whether flammable material, including polystyrene boards blocking windows of multiple apartments, may have contributed to the inferno.\n \n\n   \n  The tragedy has prompted a fresh warning from Beijing about dissent in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, with city authorities urged to crack down on anyone trying to “stir chaos,” and officials referencing pro-democracy protests that broke out in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know:\n \n\n   \n    How did the blaze start?\n \n\n   \n  Firefighters first received a call about the fire shortly before 3 p.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) on Wednesday,   according to the Hong Kong Fire Department.\n \n\n   \n  The blaze started at Wang Cheong House, a 32-story residential building and one of eight tower blocks that make up the Wang Fuk Court complex, which was undergoing renovations, according to deputy director of the Hong Kong Fire Services Derek Armstrong Chan.\n \n\n   \n  By the time fire crews were on the scene at the first building, the scaffolding and netting was on fire. Firefighters began tackling that blaze, but it quickly spread from building to building, turning a single tower block fire into multiple simultaneous multi-story infernos.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven of the eight tower blocks within the complex were affected by the blaze, forcing those who were able to escape the flames into temporary accommodation.\n \n\n   \n  But it quickly emerged many residents remained trapped inside their apartments, with firefighters unable to reach them amid searing temperatures inside the buildings as well as falling debris.\n \n\n   \n  Firefighters knew where many people were trapped, Chan said, but the extreme heat prevented rescuers reaching them.\n \n\n   \n  A man was rescued alive from the 16th story of one of the towers in the Wang Fuk Court complex on Thursday, public broadcaster RTHK reported, citing Hong Kong’s fire department.\n \n\n   \n    Evacuations, polystyrene boards\n \n\n   \n  A key question for authorities remains why the other tower blocks were not evacuated more quickly once the fire began to spread from the first building.\n \n\n   \n  Early Thursday morning local time, a police spokesperson said Hong Kong Police arrested three men – two company directors and a consultant – accusing them of “gross negligence.” All three were granted bail on Friday, police said.\n \n\n   \n  The city’s anti-corruption body made 11 arrests on Friday as part of ongoing investigations into possible corruption regarding the renovation of the apartment complex.\n \n\n   \n  Police found the construction company name on inflammable polystyrene boards that firefighters found blocking some windows at the apartment complex. Officials added that they suspect other construction materials found at the apartments – including protective nets, canvas, and plastic covers – failed to meet safety standards.\n \n\n   \n  “These polystyrene boards are extremely inflammable and the fire spread very rapidly,” Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said.\n \n\n   \n  “Their presence was unusual so we have referred the incident to the police for further enquiries.”\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security Chris Tang said later the mesh nets did comply with safety standards.\n \n\n   \n    What do we know about the victims?\n \n\n   \n  At least 146 people have so far been confirmed dead, including a 37-year-old firefighter who sustained injuries while trying to tackle the flames, Hong Kong officials said, warning the toll could still rise.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven Indonesians and one Philippine national were among those who died. Their consulates said all eight worked as foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong, which is home to 368,000 of these mostly women employees, contracted from low-income Asian countries.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said the firefighter, who they identified as Ho Wai-ho, was rushed to hospital for treatment but succumbed to his injuries.\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 people were injured in the blaze, including at least 11   firefighters, the city’s fire department said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said on Saturday 150 people were thought to be missing, but head of Hong Kong police’s Casualty Enquiry Unit Tsang Shuk-yin at a press conference Sunday revised this figure down to around 40 after some of the missing were found among the dead or hospitalized. She also said some of the missing persons reports were invalid.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have completed searches at four of the seven apartment buildings which caught fire, head of Hong Kong police’s Disaster Victims Identification Unit Cheng Ka-chun said at Sunday’s news conference. “During the search, bodies were found in the building corridors, flats, staircases, and even on rooftops,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking alongside Cheng and Tsang, the police’s New Territories North Regional Commander Lam Man-han said it could take between three to four weeks to complete rescue efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of residents are now likely homeless in a city where there is already acute shortage of housing and public housing. Many displaced residents and survivors spent   a third night in temporary shelters on Friday while those affected are being given emergency funds and other support.\n \n\n   \n  A 65-year-old resident of the estate who gave his surname as Ho stood behind police tape on Thursday morning and watched the smoldering tower blocks as he contemplated his next steps.\n \n\n   \n  A resident of Block 1, in the easternmost corner of the complex, Ho said he fled immediately when a fire alarm sounded and counted himself lucky for the relatively light damage his building faced.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t doubt many elderly, cats and dogs are still in there,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Is this common in Hong Kong?\n \n\n   \n  This is likely the deadliest fire in Hong Kong since World War II. Previously, the 1996 Garley building fire, which killed 41 people, was  widely described  as the worst peacetime fire in Hong Kong history.\n \n\n   \n  Disasters like this are extremely rare in Hong Kong. One of the densest cities in the world, it has a strong track record when it comes to building safety, thanks to its high-quality construction and strict enforcement of building regulations.\n \n\n   \n  Also, bamboo scaffolding is ubiquitous in the city, used not only in the construction of new buildings, but also in the renovation of thousands of historic tenements every year.\n \n\n   \n  But the technique has been  facing mounting scrutiny  for its safety and durability. While bamboo is celebrated for its flexibility, it is also combustible and prone to deterioration over time.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s Development Bureau recently announced that 50% of new public building projects erected from March onwards would need to use metal scaffolding to “better protect workers” and align with modern construction standards in “advanced cities.”\n \n\n   \n  That statement drew backlash from residents, many of whom noted that bamboo scaffolding is a cultural heritage that needs to be maintained.\n \n\n   \n    Pressure on Chinese and Hong Kong officials\n \n\n   \n  Such a deadly blaze is likely to pile pressure on both Hong Kong and Chinese officials.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous part of China and run by its own local government that answers to leaders in Beijing. But China has also ramped up control over the city in recent years, especially after huge and sometimes violent democracy protests swept the city in 2019. Dissent has been quashed and protests, once a daily feature of life in Hong Kong, have been snuffed out.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Beijing’s national security office in the city warned against a resurgence of dissent, calling for the city’s government to punish those wishing to use the fire as a pretext to “oppose China and stir chaos in Hong Kong.” A pro-Beijing newspaper reported that a high-ranking Hong Kong police superintendent in charge of national security also visited the site of the fire.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese leader Xi Jinping expressed his condolences to the victims of the disaster, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  Xi urged “all-out efforts” from representatives of China’s Central Committee and the Hong Kong Liaison Office to do “everything possible” to assist efforts in minimizing casualties and losses from the fire, according to CCTV.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/europe/russia-shadow-fleet-ukraine-explosions-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Ukraine says it hit Russian ‘shadow fleet’ tankers with underwater drones in Black Sea","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine claims to have used Sea Baby underwater drones in a joint operation with its navy to strike two Russian shadow fleet tankers—the Gambian-flagged Virat and Kairos—in the Black Sea.

There was no immediate comment from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Both tankers sustained critical damage, the source said, and were effectively taken out of service. “This will deal a significant blow to the transportation of Russian oil.”\n \n\n   \n  Russia uses hundreds of tankers – many sailing under different flags of convenience – to ship its oil to customers in defiance of sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The Gambian-flagged tanker Virat was attacked again on Saturday, after first sustaining damage on Friday, according to Turkey’s Transport Ministry.\n \n\n   \n  Minor damage was sustained above the waterline, according to Turkish maritime authorities, and there was no fire. The vessel is some 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the Turkish coast. Ship tracking data showed it slowing and turning towards the coast late on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no request from the personnel to abandon the ship,” the Turkish transport ministry said, but a firefighting tugboat had been sent to the scene.\n \n\n   \n  The Turkish foreign ministry expressed concern over the attacks, which “posed serious risks to the safety of navigation, life, property, and the environment in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  The Virat’s destination was unclear. Shipping data showed it awaiting orders in the Black Sea. It was sanctioned by the United States in January when it sailed under a different name, and by the United Kingdom and European Union later this year.\n \n\n   \n  There was also an explosion on another ship that carries Russian crude oil in a nearby part of the Black Sea on Friday. All 25 crew members on board that tanker, the Gambian- flagged Kairos, were evacuated. Neither vessel was in Turkish waters when they were hit.\n \n\n   \n  Video showed Turkish tugs tackling an extensive fire on board the ship about 30 miles off the Turkish coast. On Saturday the Turkish Transport ministry said that a fire on the open deck of the Kairos had been extinguished.\n \n\n   \n  The Kairos is 275 meters long and weighs nearly 80,000 tons. It was sanctioned by the EU earlier this year and left an Indian port earlier this month to return to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, several unexplained explosions occurred on ships that have carried oil for Russia from the Black Sea.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Virat and the Kairos had transited the Bosphorus Strait into the Black Sea. Other ships also sanctioned for carrying Russian crude oil were traveling the same route, according to shipping data on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  There was also an attack by a marine drone early Saturday on a mooring point in Novorossiysk, according to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium.\n \n\n   \n  The pipeline carries oil from Kazakhstan – through Russia – to customers overseas. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry said it had “activated a plan to redirect export oil volumes to alternative routes” after the strike.\n \n\n   \n  Kazakhstan’s foreign affairs ministry  issued a statement  protesting “yet another deliberate attack” on the pipeline, saying it harmed relations between the central Asian nation and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “This incident marks the third act of aggression against an exclusively civilian facility whose operation is safeguarded by norms of international law,” said spokesperson Aibek Smadiyarov.\n \n\n   \n  Novorossiysk has been attacked by Ukrainian drones multiple times.

Attorney General Pam Bondi called her directly, but offered no clarity, a source familiar with the call told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier that day, while Halligan was visiting a prosecutors’ office in her district nearly two hours south in Richmond, a federal judge determined she was unlawfully serving in the position. The Justice Department, the judge found, had already used up the 120-day period set aside for interim US attorneys before their nominations by the president must be evaluated by the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  The judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, therefore determined the indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, as well as Halligan’s criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, were invalid.\n \n\n   \n  Another judge had days before  slammed Halligan’s lawyering  before the grand jury in the Comey case as so problematic, it raised questions about whether the case could continue.\n \n\n   \n  The dismissal of Comey’s case led to a scramble among the Justice Department prosecutors in the office she led, in a dramatic and polarizing fashion, for nine weeks. The prosecutors now didn’t know whether they should still  list Halligan as their supervisor  on court filings. Halligan herself was unclear and waiting on directives from Justice Department headquarters, a source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Even now, days later, Halligan’s future as a top prosecutor remains in a sort of purgatory — with Justice Department officials still working through how they might bring the cases against Comey and James back to life — and her position inside the US attorney’s office up for debate. A source familiar with Halligan says she has been excluded from these ongoing conversations.\n \n\n   \n  Another official close to Justice Department headquarters, however, disputed that Halligan wasn’t part of those conversations, and said any confusion was coming from within the local prosecutors’ office. The official said senior DOJ leadership has had discussions with Halligan before and after McGowan Currie’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The official familiar with the matter said the DOJ prepared guidance to be sent to everyone in the Alexandria office that said Halligan wasn’t removed as a result of McGowan Currie’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The events of Halligan’s 63 days as interim US attorney empowered by President Donald Trump himself, her former private client, have eroded the bench of experienced prosecutors in the once-premier Alexandria-based prosecutors’ office. Many fear the court itself will look differently at the credibility of Justice Department attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s less trust in the office, generally speaking,” one person familiar with the office’s prosecutors told CNN recently.\n \n\n   \n    From White House adviser to Trump’s most important prosecutor\n \n\n   \n  Days before a five-year window closed on September 30 for Comey to face charges over congressional testimony in 2020, then-US Attorney Erik Siebert was pushed out of the position. Siebert had hesitated on bringing the cases against Comey and James, after career prosecutors in the US attorney’s office pushed back against the viability of doing so.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Siebert’s ouster, Trump posted a stunning public message addressed to “Pam” on his Truth Social account. In it, he told Bondi they couldn’t “delay any longer” when it came to bringing charges against his political enemies — specifically citing Sen. Adam Schiff, Comey and James. Trump also suggested that Halligan, a White House adviser who was currently working on reviewing exhibits in Smithsonian museums, take over the Virginia office and the cases he wanted to see prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  “Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot,” Trump wrote. Later, he posted that he intended to nominate Halligan, a former insurance lawyer, to the post.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan had previously only ever been a lawyer on cases in federal court for a few of Trump’s civil matters, and had no prosecutorial experience.\n \n\n   \n  But she had the confidence and the drive to deliver for the president.\n \n\n   \n  A source close to Halligan told CNN that despite being the Trump administration’s selection, Justice Department headquarters declined to provide lawyers to assist Halligan as she prepared to appear before a grand jury in Alexandria with evidence against Comey, and at least one other prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia declined to accompany her. FBI agents and lawyers working to prepare her on the case were denied a paralegal to assist in the presentation to the grand jury, multiple sources told CNN. Top Justice Department officials told the White House they had offered to help.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan then began a crash course to prepare, spending hours with FBI attorneys and agents who led the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  But Justice Department officials told her that the deputy attorney general’s office — led by Trump’s former personal attorney Todd Blanche — didn’t have lawyers to help her, and that it was against federal rules of criminal procedure for an attorney from DOJ headquarters to be in the grand jury room when she presented Comey’s case.\n \n\n   \n  “Baseless palace intrigue stories like this won’t distract or deter this Department of Justice from our mission to make America safe again,” the Justice Department said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The outstanding team of US Attorneys assembled by Attorney General Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Blanche are fully empowered and supported to uphold the rule of law, prosecute crime, and protect our communities—and especially in light of this week’s horrific attack against the  National Guard , this Department will remain focused on its mission to take America back from those who hate our values and endanger our citizens,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n    Internal office fallout\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s installment of Halligan immediately prompted distrust and disappointment among the career prosecutors working in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutors based in Alexandria carried out some of the Justice Department’s most high-profile and sensitive investigations, especially related to national security. And Trump’s wish to rout out prosecutors he didn’t trust had largely not affected that district.\n \n\n   \n  “It was viewed as a relatively stable and safe place to be. People were able to put their heads down and work,” one person familiar with the office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Within two weeks of Halligan’s landing, however, the district’s top national security prosecutor, Michael Ben’Ary, and others  were fired  with little reason given, and they began hitting back at her and other Trump administration officials’ decisions. Comey’s son-in-law, who was a deputy national security chief in the Alexandria office,  also resigned  on the evening of Comey’s indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Ben’Ary  taped a note  on his former office door as he exited, writing to “my EDVA colleagues” that “the decisions to remove experienced career officials from US Attorneys Offices, the FBI, and other critical parts of DOJ undermines our country’s ability to counter terrorist organizations, malign nation-state actors, and countless others that seek to harm our nation and its citizens.”\n \n\n   \n  Ben’Ary’s departure came in the middle of the office’s criminal prosecution of an alleged terrorist for the 2021 bombing of a civilian gate at the international airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The case is still headed to trial, and the defendant’s lawyers have asked a judge to formally disqualify Halligan from directing the prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  After Halligan indicted Letitia James on mortgage fraud charges, more heads began to roll. Elizabeth Yusi, who wrote an internal memo outlining why prosecutors didn’t believe there was enough evidence to support charges against James, and Kristin Bird, her deputy, were fired. News of the memo was publicly reported. A source close to Halligan said Yusi never voiced concerns about the case to Halligan. The source said Halligan was not made aware of the memo.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan believed attorneys were leaking information about separate investigations to the media, CNN previously  reported .\n \n\n   \n  Another prosecutor, Maggie Cleary, a well-connected Republican who had landed in the office shortly before as Halligan’s No. 2, was sidelined and moved out to a role in the department’s Washington headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  Paranoia began to grow inside the once stable office. Shortly after Ben’Ary’s departure, prosecutors started to believe that Halligan was working closely with Ed Martin, the Trump administration’s pardon attorney who also pushed for prosecutions of the president’s political enemies — especially James — and the exoneration of MAGA allies.\n \n\n   \n  Martin visited the Alexandria US attorney’s office during Halligan’s tenure, sources told CNN, adding to the speculation. One source told CNN he was delivering binders on James’ properties at that time and was never involved in daily decisions.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Eastern District of Virginia prosecutors grew concerned Halligan might install Martin as her second-in-command, which was a career position, the sources told CNN. A source familiar with the dynamic said Halligan was never considering this option.\n \n\n   \n  Though Halligan had gotten the public political boosts of securing the Comey and James indictments, inside the office she was largely absent from interacting with the career prosecutors who staffed many of the cases. Halligan attended meetings with the team fairly regularly, but she did not build close relationships.\n \n\n   \n  The distance between Halligan and the career attorneys isn’t just in terms of communication, one person said. Halligan has been seen walking with court security by her side even inside the office.\n \n\n   \n  Some were told by security in the Alexandria building that Halligan may have placed cameras around the office to more closely monitor her workforce.\n \n\n   \n  The security cameras may have been a planned project, but people familiar with the office described them as among the changes that added “paranoia” to the environment.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan disputed the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The allegation that I installed, directed the installation of, or had any involvement with installing security-camera equipment in the office is completely false,” Halligan said in a statement to CNN. “Any review, audit or questioning of those in charge of the security systems will confirm that I had no role - direct or indirect - in their installation or operation.”\n \n\n   \n     Grand jury tumult \n \n\n   \n  The choice to have Halligan solely present two of Trump’s most sought-after indictments to grand jurors has been heavily scrutinized.\n \n\n   \n  Two judges in the Eastern District of Virginia trial-level federal court have read the grand jury transcripts, and questioned what Halligan said to the grand jurors.\n \n\n   \n  “The court has identified two statements by the prosecutor to the grand jurors that on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process,” Judge William Fitzpatrick wrote in an opinion on November 17. The judge said that after Halligan told the grand jurors she was their legal adviser, she appeared to suggest Comey would need to testify at his trial and that the Justice Department may have more and better evidence later.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan’s exact words are redacted in public court records. The Justice Department has disputed Fitzpatrick’s read of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  The judges have also questioned how she skipped presenting the final indictment in the full secret proceeding, after grand jurors only agreed to approve only two-thirds of the Comey charges.\n \n\n   \n  Issues of how Halligan presented the case came to a head during a hearing earlier this month when she told a judge the full grand jury had not reviewed the final indictment she signed against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  At a court hearing on November 19, the lead attorney for the Justice Department, Tyler Lemons, whom Halligan had brought in from North Carolina to handle the Comey case, told the judge only one indictment was presented to the grand jury. The grand jurors told the court in a filing that they hadn’t approved it, then later that original filing was marked to say the grand jury approved two of three charges Halligan presented.\n \n\n   \n  After going briefly silent, then needing to confirm what he heard, Judge Michael Nachmanoff turned to Halligan.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Halligan, you can come to the podium. You’re counsel of record. You can address the court. It might be easier,” the judge said.\n \n\n   \n  She attempted to cut the judge off before he finished speaking, to tell him his impression was wrong.\n \n\n   \n  She explained in court that a foreperson and another grand juror were present when they handed up the indictment. She said that the foreperson said in open court that day that they were declining to indict on the first charge on the document, but were indicting on the second and third charges — making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. Halligan’s explanation confirmed that what the judge called the “operative” indictment against Comey wasn’t formally presented to the full grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m familiar with the transcript,” the judge said, then told her to sit down.\n \n\n   \n  “OK,” Halligan responded.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan’s grand jury work also raised questions in the case against James, the New York attorney general. But those issues hadn’t been fully fleshed out in court before a judge dismissed her case on November 24.\n \n\n   \n  Other prosecutors previously working with a grand jury in Norfolk — another courthouse in the Eastern District of Virginia — hadn’t moved to indict the case, even after Trump posted on social media pushing Bondi to charge James, Comey and another political adversary, Democratic Sen. Schiff.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan there, too, presented the James mortgage fraud indictment to a grand jury in Alexandria over one afternoon in early October. Halligan had gone through the case with the FBI — and asked for all possible evidence. She determined that while two of James’ properties were under investigation, there was only one probe investigation with enough evidence to take to the grand jury. With schedule changes, Halligan avoided the four-hour drive to Norfolk and brought the charges before a grand jury in Alexandria, once again, by herself.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan secured an indictment against James that afternoon. While she had told department headquarters she would bring the case against James, she did not brief them that she had decided to bring it that day. Top officials learned Halligan had secured the indictment from news reports.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next for Halligan\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department officials are still working through how they might bring the cases against Comey and James back to life.\n \n\n   \n  The cumulative effect on Halligan’s reputation, despite Bondi calling her an “excellent US attorney” last week, has been severe.\n \n\n   \n  In just two months, Halligan went from being the primary prosecutor going after the president’s political enemies, to a headache for the Justice Department who installed her — with prosecutors unclear how to proceed with the two cases and others presented under her authority.\n \n\n   \n  Her name remains on court filings.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:39 PM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More than a dozen demonstrators were arrested in lower Manhattan on Saturday after their attempts to stop federal agents from conducting immigration and enforcement activities, according to a law enforcement official.\n \n\n   \n  The group of protesters chanted “ICE out of New York” in footage that showed them locking arms to form a barrier blocking federal agents from exiting the garage in their car. Some grabbed planters from the roadway and hurled them at federal vehicles, the official said. The confrontations prompted some officers to deploy what appeared to be pepper spray to subdue demonstrators, the official added.\n \n\n   \n  The incident is the latest in an array of protests that have taken place across the country between federal agents and demonstrators who are fighting against the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s protest took place just down the street from Foley Square, where there was a larger demonstration last month. October’s protest came the day after a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street – a popular and highly trafficked area well-known for its street vendors who sell counterfeit designer goods.\n \n\n   \n  A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said individuals “dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers” after social media posts called “agitators to ICE’s location” in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Publicizing details about the location of ICE agents, DHS said, puts “a target” on their backs, citing an increase in assaults against officers. “We won’t let violent rioters slow us down and anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Ricky Patel, special agent in charge of New York’s Homeland Security Investigations office, apologized in a call with New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch on Saturday for how the enforcement action unfolded, two law enforcement officials briefed on the call said. Tisch criticized the action for putting the public, federal agents and officers at risk, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch warned Patel that the displays of force by federal agents intending to cause chaos and disorder on city streets need to stop because they will lead to someone getting hurt, one of the officials familiar with the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to HSI for further information.\n \n\n   \n  The incident unfolded just before noon when NYPD officers responded to a 911 call for a “disorderly group” near Chinatown and observed multiple people blocking the street and exits at different locations and “throwing debris,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “They were instructed multiple times to disperse, and they did not comply. As a result, multiple individuals were taken into custody,” the NYPD said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The situation remained peaceful at first as the crowd of protesters gathered in front of a closed garage before moving to the corner of the street, chanting “ICE out of New York” and shouting at police officers who did not engage. Federal officers at the scene were armed and many of them wore face coverings.\n \n\n   \n  At one point, the garage opened and a barrier of protesters continued chanting while blocking a vehicle from exiting. The group also created a blockade with piles of wood and cardboard from a construction dumpster and trash bins, according to videos from the scene.\n \n\n   \n  As the car moved out of the garage, protesters chased and shouted at it while police officers tried to stop them and tackled at least one protester who was later released.\n \n\n   \n  City Council member Julie Menin called federal immigration agents’ actions “utterly irresponsible” after the incident  in a statement on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Today, ICE threatened the public’s safety yet again — and this time, their actions created a dangerous situation for both the public and our NYPD officers,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The New York Immigration Coalition, which represents over 200 immigrant and refugee rights groups statewide,  criticized law enforcement’s response  to protesters in a statement and called for the immediate release of those arrested at the demonstration.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/us-military-second-strike-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"20:57:00-05:00","title":"US Military Conducts Second Strike Killing Survivors on Suspected Drug Boat in Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military carried out a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2, 2025, after the initial attack failed to kill all on board.

military carried out second strike killing survivors on a suspected drug boat that had already been attacked, sources say \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:57 PM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military carried out a follow - up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating  in the Caribbean on September 2  after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That September strike was the first in what became a regular series of attacks on alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  While the first strike appeared to disable the boat and cause deaths, the military assessed there were survivors, according to the sources. The second attack killed the remaining crew on board, bringing the total death toll to 11, and sunk the ship.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican-led Senate and House armed services committees said they plan to conduct “vigorous oversight” on the follow-up strike.\n \n\n   \n  Before the operation, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the military to ensure the strike killed everyone on board, but it’s not clear whether he knew there were survivors before the second strike, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The strike and deaths were announced by President Donald Trump on the day of the attacks, but the administration has never publicly acknowledged killing survivors.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said on Thursday that  action on land  to stop suspected drug-trafficking networks in Venezuela could “start very soon,” amid  questions about the legality  of the US military’s campaign around Latin America. Officials have acknowledged not knowing the identities of everyone on board the boats before they are struck, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  “I have been alarmed by the number of vessels that this administration has taken out without a single consultation of Congress,” Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean told CNN this week. The House Foreign Affairs Committee member said she viewed in a sensitive compartmented information facility “some documents around the sinking of these vessels and the murder of the people on those boats. Nowhere in there was there evidence of what was going on.”\n \n\n   \n  People briefed on the “double-tap” strike said they were concerned that it could violate the law of armed conflict, which prohibits the execution of an enemy combatant who is “hors de combat,” or taken out of the fight due to injury or surrender.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re breaking the law either way,” said Sarah Harrison, a former associate general counsel at the Pentagon who now serves as a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank. “They’re killing civilians in the first place, and then if you assume they’re combatants, it’s also unlawful — under the law of armed conflict, if somebody is ‘hors de combat’ and no longer able to fight, then they have to be treated humanely.”\n \n\n   \n  Details of the strikes were first reported by  The Intercept  and  The Washington Post .\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth in a  social media post  Friday continued to defend the strikes on alleged drug boats, writing, “Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.”\n \n\n   \n  “Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military was aware there were survivors in the water following the first strike on September 2 and carried out another to both sink the vessel and kill the remaining crew, the sources said. Pentagon officials told lawmakers in briefings afterward that the second strike was done to sink the boat so it would not pose a threat to navigation, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has hit boats multiple times in several instances to sink them, the sources said, but the September 2 strike is the only known instance where the military deliberately killed survivors.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear why the survivors were not picked up like they were following another strike in the Caribbean in October. In that instance, the Trump administration rescued two survivors and  repatriated them  to their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  In a post announcing the September 2 strike on Truth Social, Trump said the US military had conducted “a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration has tried to legally justify its strikes on the boats by claiming they are carrying individuals linked to roughly two dozen drug cartels engaged in an armed conflict with the US. The White House has said repeatedly that the administration’s actions “comply fully with the Law of Armed Conflict,” the area of international law that is designed to prevent attacks on civilians.\n \n\n   \n  Many legal experts, however, say the suspected drug traffickers are civilians, not combatants, and that the strikes therefore amount to extrajudicial killings.\n \n\n   \n  The top officials on the Republican-led Senate Armed Services Committee said late Friday their panel plans to conduct “vigorous oversight” on the follow-up strike.\n \n\n   \n  “The Committee is aware of recent news reports – and the Department of Defense’s initial response – regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” the committee’s Republican chair, Sen. Roger Wicker, and top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The Committee has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  Reps. Mike Rogers and Adam Smith, the top Republican and top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, respectively, followed suit Saturday evening, saying they are “taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, and cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights.\n \n\n   \n  But in a classified legal opinion produced over the summer, the Justice Department argued the president is legally allowed to authorize lethal strikes against 24 cartels and criminal organizations in self-defense, because the groups pose an imminent threat to Americans,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n  That argument has potentially been undercut by the behavior of the suspected traffickers who have been targeted: In at least one instance, a boat had turned around and was moving away from the US before being struck. Survivors of the strike on September 2 also posed no imminent threat, since they were effectively incapacitated, the sources briefed on the strikes and Harrison noted.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US defense officials and US allies have expressed skepticism of the legality of the military campaign. The commander of US Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, offered to leave his post during a tense meeting last month with Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine after he raised questions about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Holsey  will leave his post  in December, just one year into his tenure as the SOUTHCOM chief.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers specializing in international law within the Pentagon’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes. Multiple current and former uniformed lawyers told CNN the strikes do not appear lawful.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom is also  no longer sharing intelligence  with the US about suspected drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/middleeast/lebanon-pope-leo-visit-christian-community-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000Z","title":"In battered Lebanon, an ancient Christian community awaits the new pope","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV is set to visit Lebanon for a brief three-day trip beginning on November 30, 2025, marking his first overseas visit as pope.

Sun November 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The black-clad priest yanked on the white rope. At once the bells began to clang.\n \n\n   \n  The evening mass was beginning at the Monastery of Mar Maroun, or Saint Maroun, in the town of Annaya, high in the Lebanese mountains.\n \n\n   \n  This monastery overlooking the Mediterranean will be one of the stops on  Pope Leo XIV ’s three-day  visit to Lebanon , beginning Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The congregation on this cool late November evening was modest in number but their voices rang out as they sang hymns – including one in Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, the language Jesus is believed to have spoken.\n \n\n   \n  Christianity in Lebanon is almost as old as Christianity itself. Yet the community, with roots so deep in this land, increasingly feels its grip slipping. In recent decades many Christians have left, for the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Australia and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  The last papal visit to Lebanon was in May 2012 by Benedict XVI. Since then, the Lebanese – Christian and Muslim alike – have been through a failed revolution, an economic collapse, the Covid-19 pandemic, the catastrophic Beirut port blast and another war with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanon has 18 officially recognized faiths and sects. Every event here has a sectarian angle. Pope Leo’s visit is no exception.\n \n\n   \n  “They have become stronger than us,” said Thérèse Hanna, a woman in her seventies, as she left Mass at the monastery.\n \n\n   \n  “They, who?” I asked.\n \n\n   \n  “The Shia,” she replied, adding confidently, “Of course, the Pope knows that.”\n \n\n   \n  Shia Muslims are now Lebanon’s single largest sect. Once the country’s hewers of wood and fetchers of water, the Shia have grown in number, wealth and power. That power is best embodied by Hezbollah, the armed group and now political party that fought Israel for decades, most recently following the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, until a fragile ceasefire was brokered one year ago.\n \n\n   \n  The Shia pose the most potent challenge to Christian power in Lebanon, a fact not lost on anyone here. Yet nothing is simple. Hezbollah has formed coalitions with Christian parties in the past. Politics makes strange bedfellows.\n \n\n   \n  The first official papal visit to Lebanon was in May 1997 by John Paul II, when the country was recovering from the ravages of the 1975-1990 civil war. Though still saddled by an Israeli occupation in the south and a Syrian occupation in the rest of the country, it was a time of optimism. Many of those who had fled the civil war (and wars with Israel) were venturing back, aid and investments were pouring in. Beirut was undergoing a mad, haphazard building boom. A new, reinvigorated Lebanon seemed to be rising from the ashes.\n \n\n   \n  After the travails of the last decade, however, that era of hope feels like a distant memory.\n \n\n   \n  The economy is still struggling. Official corruption and mismanagement are still the rule rather than the exception. Yes, with the ceasefire one might conclude that active war with Israel is over, but that’s an illusion.\n \n\n   \n  On an almost daily basis, Israeli warplanes and drones  strike  Lebanon. Israeli officials claim Hezbollah has not fully withdrawn from its positions along the southern border and that it is re-arming and regrouping. Israel still occupies five strategic locations on the Lebanese side of the border.\n \n\n   \n  A week before Pope Leo was due to land in Beirut, an Israeli air strike on the capital killed 57-year-old  Haytham Ali Tabatabai , a senior Hezbollah military commander.\n \n\n   \n  Hezbollah for its part has not fired on Israel since the ceasefire went into effect on November 27 last year.\n \n\n   \n  In Beirut, the joke is that the US-brokered ceasefire means Hezbollah must cease, and Israel can fire.\n \n\n   \n  This is just a small fraction of the complex kaleidoscope called Lebanon where Leo will land on the second leg of his first overseas trip as pope.\n \n\n   \n  The pontiff’s visit will be brief; he will arrive from Turkey on Sunday and depart for Rome on Tuesday. He will meet faith leaders and political leaders and hold a series of events, the largest a Mass on the Beirut waterfront on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  There, workers have laid out tens of thousands of shiny white plastic chairs in front of a huge stage. The backdrop of the stage features in French and Arabic the phrase “blessed are the peacemakers,” flanked by the word “peace” in a variety of languages (not Hebrew), and depictions of the cedars of Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  The waterfront was created after the civil war by dumping thousands of tons of rubble from the ruins of Beirut into the sea. “Not just rubble,” CNN cameraman Charbel Mallo, a native of Lebanon, pointed out when we visited the site. “There are bones here too.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 150,000 people were killed in that war.\n \n\n   \n  Despite it all, this is a land where hope springs eternal.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the Monastery of Mar Maroun, Souad Khoury and her husband Fadi were upbeat about the pope’s visit.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been through a lot,” said Souad. “We are a country of faith. We are strong. We are still on the land.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/politics/venezuela-trump-pressure-campaign","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"15:16:00Z","title":"Trump maintains pressure campaign on Venezuela, saying its airspace should be considered closed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has intensified U.S. pressure on Venezuela by declaring Venezuelan airspace closed and warning airlines and criminal networks to avoid it.

Venezuela, saying its airspace should be considered closed \n       \n  By Kristen Holmes, Alejandra Jaramillo, Stefano Pozzebon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:16 PM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States continued its pressure campaign against Venezuela on Saturday as President Donald Trump issued a broad directive on social media, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace.\n \n\n   \n  “Please consider the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela to be closed in its entirety,” he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement marks the latest turn of the wheel as the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro out of office. Officially, the Trump administration says it is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but  regime change  is a possible side effect of those efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s foreign minister denounced Trump’s Saturday directive, calling it a “colonialist threat” that constitutes an “extravagant, illegal, and unjustified aggression against the people of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  The US can’t close another country’s airspace. The Federal Aviation Administration  last week warned  major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution. Direct flights by US passenger or cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some US airlines fly over the country for South American flights.\n \n\n   \n  As Trump has sought to clamp down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, in recent weeks the president acknowledged he had signed off on plans for the  CIA to operate  inside Venezuela. And Trump designated Maduro and his government allies as members of a  foreign terrorist organization  earlier this week, a move administration officials argue will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela. On Thursday,  Trump suggested land strikes  inside the country could come imminently.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent weeks, you’ve been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many. Of course, there aren’t too many coming in by sea anymore,” Trump told service members during a Thanksgiving call.\n \n\n   \n  “You probably noticed that people aren’t wanting to be delivering by sea, and we’ll be starting to stop them by land also,” the president continued. “The land is easier, but that’s going to start very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on Saturday applauded the president’s suggestion that US land action in Venezuela would start soon.\n \n\n   \n  “I very much appreciate and respect the determination by President Trump to deal with the drug caliphate countries that inhabit our backyard — chief among them Venezuela,” the South Carolina Republican said in a statement provided to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops in the region as part of what the Pentagon has branded “Operation Southern Spear.” Dozens  have been killed  in boat strikes as part of the anti-drug-trafficking campaign.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Maduro has sought to project strength and control. “I ask you to remain unshakeable in your composure, ready and prepared to defend our right as a nation. We are a republic in arms!” he said in a televised address to troops Thursday evening.\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides, led largely by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have continued to discuss a slew of military options against Maduro. Trump cut off all diplomatic talk with Venezuela in October, but he seemed to soften last week when he told reporters that Maduro “would like to talk” and later suggested he  would be open  to speaking with the Venezuelan leader “at a certain time.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro and his associates have reached out to the White House through a number of channels, and there are ongoing discussions about what communication between the two countries might look like, multiple administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Maduro spoke by phone last week, according to  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Trump framed the change of heart as a matter of saving lives.\n \n\n   \n  “If he’s the leader, if we can save lives, if we can do things the easy way, that’s fine, and if we have to do it the hard way, that’s fine, too,” Trump told reporters when asked why he would engage directly with Maduro given the terrorist organization designation.\n \n\n   \n  During earlier informal talks between the US and Venezuela, Maduro signaled an openness to eventually stepping down, though it would not be for at least 18 months, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. While some US officials thought this might be a solution, the White House eventually concluded it would only support a plan that saw Maduro’s immediate departure.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Venezuelans are reacting to the growing isolation with a mix of resignation and apprehension.\n \n\n   \n  For Venezuela, the recent geopolitical instability is not without precedent. Over the last 10 years, the nation has seen economic collapse, mass street protests, failed coups and countless conspiracies.\n \n\n   \n  “Will they bomb? Will they not bomb? Who knows. … I don’t really follow the news, and to be honest, nobody knows nothing,” said Marilyn, a waitress at a cafe in Caracas, who asked to use only her first name for fear of retaliation from government officials.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s threats of potential military action are  yet to trigger  a tangible impact in the lives of millions of Venezuelans like Marilyn, but the  government repression  remains palpable. At least 54 people were detained for expressing dissent in October alone, according to the human rights group PROVEA, some arrested simply for sharing anti-Maduro messages on WhatsApp.\n \n\n   \n  The possibility of US strikes is on everyone’s mind, but any mention of it is confined to the private sphere.\n \n\n   \n  In public, life carries on as usual, with Christmas carols and Black Friday announcements blending with Maduro’s almost daily appearances on television.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Maduro said publicly that no matter what the United States does, “they will not be able to defeat Venezuela,” claiming the South American county is “invincible.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon reported from Caracas, Venezuela. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/middleeast/jenin-west-bank-israeli-military-men-killed-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00Z","title":"Israeli military kills two men after they appeared to surrender during operation in West Bank","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli military forces in the West Bank city of Jenin killed two men who appeared to be surrendering during a counterterrorism operation, prompting condemnation from the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who called it a 'field execution' and a war crime.

soldiers shot and killed two people who appeared to be surrendering in the occupied West Bank, an act described by the Palestinian Authority as a “fully-fledged war crime.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident took place in the Palestinian city of Jenin in the West Bank, during a widescale “counterterrorism” operation by the Israeli military on Thursday. The Palestinian Authority confirmed their deaths and identified the men as 26-year-old Al-Muntasir Mahmoud Qassem Abdullah and 37-year-old Youssef Ali Youssef Asasa.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) identified the two men as fighters, saying in a statement that they exchanged fire with Israeli forces until their ammunition was depleted, after which they were besieged and killed in what it described as a “field execution.”\n \n\n   \n  The PA said the incident was a “flagrant violation of all international laws, conventions, norms, and humanitarian values.”\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday evening, Israel’s far-right Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who had previously said the border police “acted exactly as expected of them,” doubled down on his support, promoting the unit’s commander. In a video released on social media, Ben Gvir said, “This distorted procedure must end – when one of our fighters shoots a terrorist, he’s immediately taken in for questioning. This distorted procedure must end, this mindset must stop.”\n \n\n   \n  Sharon Nahari, the lawyer for the three Border Police personnel involved, told CNN on Friday that his clients were interrogated by the State Attorney’s department of internal police investigations, which is conducting an inquiry into the incident. The three were later released on bail.\n \n\n   \n  Nahari said that his clients genuinely believed their lives were in danger, and that the Border Police had commanded the suspects to remove their clothes to ensure that they were not armed, but they did not comply.   The lawyer added that “the shooting was conducted merely for the sake of neutralizing them and not with the intention to kill.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the two individuals were wanted by authorities for alleged terror activities.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it had been operating alongside border police to arrest two individuals who belonged to a “terrorist organization operating in Jenin,” and accused them of throwing explosive devices and gunfire at security forces.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF added that the “surrender procedure” lasted several hours, with the men exiting the building after an engineering vehicle was used. “After they exited the building, gunfire was carried out at the wanted individuals,” the IDF said in a joint statement with the Israel Police.\n \n\n   \n  “The incident is currently under investigation by field commanders and will be transferred for review by the relevant authorities,” the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  Video of the incident shared on social media showed two men emerging from a building with their hands raised above their heads in apparent surrender. They are surrounded by what appear to be Israeli soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  The two men are later seen on the floor in front of the building’s entrance before multiple rounds of gunfire are heard. The body of at least one of the men could then be seen lying on the ground, according to the video.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military launched a wide-scale military operation on Wednesday in the West Bank, with Israeli forces searching “over 220 sites,” questioning dozens and arresting “several wanted individuals,” per an earlier IDF statement.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations Human Rights office said Friday that it is “appalled by the brazen killing,” calling the incident a “summary execution.”   \n \n\n   \n  “Our office has verified that since 7 October, 2023, and up until the 27 November this year, Israeli forces and settlers have killed 1,030 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” spokesperson Jeremy Laurence said  at a press briefing  in Geneva. “Among these victims were 223 children.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/style/tom-stoppard-obituary-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"British Playwright Tom Stoppard, Oscar-Winning Screenwriter and Five-Time Tony Winner, Dies at 88","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard, born Tomas Straussler in Zlin, Czechoslovakia, has died at the age of 88 in Dorset, UK.

Max Saltman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:10 PM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The award-winning British playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard has died, according to his talent agency United Agents. He was 88.\n \n\n   \n  Stoppard, who was born in Czechoslovakia, was perhaps best known in the US for his Oscar-winning screenplay for the 1998 film “Shakespeare in Love,” which he co-wrote with Marc Norman.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, he won his fifth  Tony Award  in 2023 for his play “Leopoldstadt.” He won his first Tony in 1968 for “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” his metatheatrical spin on “Hamlet.”\n \n\n   \n  Norman told CNN in an email that Stoppard was “a joy to work with.”\n \n\n   \n  “He understood that Shakespeare, that icon, was an entertainer just like we were, and that spirit drove our screenplay,” Norman said. “My thoughts go out to his family.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted to its website, United Agents said: “We are deeply saddened to announce that our beloved client and friend, Tom Stoppard, has died peacefully at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family.\n \n\n   \n  “He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language,” the statement continued. “It was an honor to work with Tom and to know him.”\n \n\n   \n  King Charles III, whose mother Queen Elizabeth knighted Stoppard in 1997, said in a statement Saturday that he and Queen Camilla were “deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard.”\n \n\n   \n  “A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history,” Charles wrote. “We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: ‘Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.’”\n \n\n   \n  Born Tomas Straussler in Zlin, in what is now the Czech Republic, Stoppard was from a secular Jewish family who fled the Nazi invasion of the country in 1939, first to Singapore, then to Australia and India. Many of Stoppard’s extended family members were murdered in the Holocaust.\n \n\n   \n  After young Tomas’ father died when the Japanese sank his boat off the Singaporean coast, his mother married an Englishman, Kenneth Stoppard, and the family moved to the United Kingdom. Tomas Straussler became Tom Stoppard.\n \n\n   \n  Stoppard, who briefly worked as a journalist before his success in theatre, had a wide oevre. Alongside his many plays, he wrote radio dramas, satirical films like Terry Gilliam’s “Brazil,” as well as film adaptations of books, including his 2012 screenplay for “Anna Karenina” and his 1987 adaptation of JG Ballard’s roman-a-clef “Empire of the Sun.”\n \n\n   \n  The playwright  wrote  in a 2024 essay published by the Huntington Theatre company that while he was born a Czech Jew, his life in Britain and his English stepfather had turned him into an “honorary Englishman.”\n \n\n   \n  “I knew I was – used to be Czech, but I didn’t feel Czech,” Stoppard wrote. “I felt about as English as you could get.”\n \n\n   \n  Later in life, Stoppard began to explore his personal history through his work. His most recent play, “Leopoldstadt,” traces a Jewish family in Vienna from the 1890s through World War II, obliquely referencing his family’s story.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been at the back of my mind,” Stoppard  said  of his family history in a 2022 interview. “It’s something I’ve never used. It felt like unfinished business.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/us/college-student-deported-honduras-thanksgiving","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"11:44:00-05:00","title":"College freshman is deported flying home for Thanksgiving surprise, despite court order","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 19-year-old college freshman, Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, was deported from the U.S. to Honduras despite a federal court order preventing her removal, while she was attempting to return home for Thanksgiving.

spending jumps 9.1% \n       \n  By Nathaniel Meyersohn, Auzinea Bacon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 PM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US retail sales on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, climbed 4.1% compared with last year, according to data released Saturday by Mastercard SpendingPulse. Online shoppers alone  spent $11.8 billion , up 9.1% from 2024, according to data collection platform Adobe Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  But those gains don’t account for higher prices due to  inflation , so actual spending could be flat.\n \n\n   \n  “We have 3% inflation, so maybe (the 4.1% increase in spending) is a real increase of just 1% or so, which is not that much of an increase,” Rick Newman, who writes The Pinpoint Press, a newsletter on the US economy, told CNN on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also a bifurcation in who’s spending. The Federal Reserve’s most recent Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the economy, showed consumer spending among low- and middle-income consumers is on the decline. Meanwhile, the Fed found high-end consumers are continuing to spend — including on luxury items and travel.\n \n\n   \n  Consumers have bought fewer items this holiday season, but the average selling prices are higher, according to Claudia Lombana, a national consumer expert.\n \n\n   \n  “The ones that have higher income are spending at will, but those who are less affluent are budgeting,” Lombana told CNN’s Omar Jimenez on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s part of the so-called K-shaped economy, in which higher earners get a boost from their stock market investments and home valuations and use their fatter paychecks to spend. But lower earners  increasingly live paycheck to paycheck  and look for discounts — or curtail their spending to cope with rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  “The story of the economy right now is it’s a bifurcated economy. If you’re lucky enough to own stocks and own a home, you’re part of the upper slant of that cave, that K-shaped economy … you’re going to be comfortable spending a fair amount of money this year,” Newman said.\n \n\n   \n  But Newman added that people on the lower slant of the K — those who don’t own stocks or a home — are increasingly worried about job security.\n \n\n   \n  “I think those people are going to be pinching pennies this holiday season,” he said, adding that they will be more frugal with gift purchases and necessities.  Heating bills , for instance, are higher because of natural gas prices going up. And  grocery prices  are on the rise, while rent hikes outpace income growth, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  Eighty-five percent of consumers  expect higher prices  because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to the National Retail Federation, or NRF. And it’s a factor in how they shop.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody is sort of going on an item-by-item basis and saying, ‘Oh, the Trump tariffs have pushed up costs here by 4% or 10%,’ but it’s on people’s minds,” Newman said.\n \n\n   \n  Value is more important than ever these days for consumers. Consumer sentiment is glum, job growth has slowed, and the federal government shutdown forced low-income shoppers to pull back spending amid a pause in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding.\n \n\n   \n  As goods and services become harder for everyday Americans to afford, shoppers have grown pickier about how they spend their money and hunt for deals. They are gravitating toward retailers they feel can help them stretch their dollars further on groceries, household essentials, clothing and electronics.\n \n\n   \n  Chains such as Walmart, TJ Maxx, Gap and others are benefiting, reporting strong sales during their latest quarters. Walmart is now gaining market share against competitors across all income groups and in several merchandise categories.\n \n\n   \n  But others, such as Target and Bath & Body Works, are struggling.\n \n\n   \n  And people are splurging less on gifts for themselves, according to Bath & Body Works.\n \n\n   \n  Shoppers are expected to continue to  splash out this holiday season , despite the cost-of-living squeeze and other economic pressures. The NRF expects retail sales in November and December to grow 3.7% to 4.2% compared with a year ago.

across  Ukraine , killing at least three people, Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky  said Saturday, as a Kyiv delegation heads to the United States for fresh peace talks.\n \n\n   \n  A flurry of diplomacy is taking place after a plan put forward by US President Donald Trump triggered alarm in Kyiv, as the original draft heavily favored Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The talks will be led from the Ukrainian side by Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, who Zelensky appointed following the resignation of his top aide on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation will build on developments from meetings in Geneva, where Kyiv and its European allies put forward a counter-proposal, Zelensky said.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner will meet the Ukrainian delegation in Miami, Florida this weekend, a White House official told CNN on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to see it end, and we won’t know for a little while, but well, we’re making progress,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida, “You know what the deadline for me is? When it’s over.”\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said during his nightly address on Saturday that the US is being “constructive” ahead of the latest round of talks, adding: “In the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end.”\n \n\n   \n  It comes as Moscow launched around 36 missiles and almost 600 drones at Ukraine on Friday night into Saturday, Zelensky the Ukrainian president said earlier. Large parts of the capital, Kyiv, are without power.\n \n\n   \n  “The main targets of the attack were energy infrastructure and civilian facilities, with extensive damage and fires in residential buildings. We currently have reports of dozens injured and three killed,” Zelensky said.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian Air Force said defense forces had shot down the bulk of the projectiles fired as of Saturday morning – the majority of them Iranian-made Shahed drones and Russian long-range Gerbera drones.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes hit the homes of ordinary Ukrainians as well as the country’s energy grid and critical infrastructure, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Telegram on Saturday morning, calling it “a difficult night… particularly in Kyiv.”\n \n\n   \n  Two people, including a 42-year-old man, were killed in the capital and 38 were injured, including a child, according to local authorities and police. The third person, a 74-year-old woman, was killed in the Kyiv region, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Kyiv was under an air raid alert for more than ten hours overnight into Saturday, CNN reporters in the city said, with drones and loud explosions audible in the skies overhead.\n \n\n   \n  Photos published by Reuters showed emergency services personnel working to enter a multi-story building in Kyiv. Dozens of windows were shattered, and a large part of the facade appeared scorched.\n \n\n   \n  Poland scrambled military jets and air defense systems in response to the attack, Warsaw’s armed forces said, adding “these actions are of a preventative nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s energy ministry said Russian attacks overnight left more than 600,000 consumers without power.\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of the attack, more than 500,000 consumers in Kyiv, more than 100,000 in the Kyiv region and almost 8,000 in the Kharkiv region were left without electricity in the morning,” the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Private energy company DTEK said in an update later on Saturday that power had been restored to about 360,000 families.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Ukrainian delegation is on their way to further discuss the US-drafted peace plan, according to the Ukrainian presidency.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky’s lead negotiator in the talks, his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned on Friday after anti-corruption agencies raided his home, creating a huge domestic headache at a time of diplomatic and military vulnerability for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  In his place, Zelensky appointed Umerov as head of the Ukrainian delegation. Umerov will participate in talks with the US and “other international partners of Ukraine, as well as with representatives of the Russian Federation to achieve a just and lasting peace,” a government statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “Ukraine continues its systematic and constructive diplomatic work for the sake of a dignified peace,” Zelensky said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Zelensky will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron – one of Kyiv’s key allies – in Paris on Monday, according to the Elysée Palace.\n \n\n   \n  A US team is also expected to visit Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week.\n \n\n   \n  Putin had said that the original proposal could “form the basis for future agreements” but also said a deal would only be possible if Kyiv withdrew from some areas in eastern Ukraine it currently holds.\n \n\n   \n  “If they don’t withdraw, we will achieve this through military means,” the Russian leader added.\n \n\n   \n   Daria Tarasova-Markina, Victoria Butenko, Laura Sharman, Billy Stockwell, Alejandra Jaramillo, Joseph Ataman, and Mariya Knight contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/asia/sri-lanka-chemmani-mass-grave-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"A blue schoolbag in a mass grave.

More commonly known as The Tamil Tigers, the group was listed as a terrorist organization by many countries including the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The war was fought along ethnic lines, pitting the majority Buddhist Sinhalese state against the predominantly Hindu ethnic minority rebels fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in the north and east after years of anti-Tamil violence. The Tigers were ultimately defeated.\n \n\n   \n  Atrocities were committed by both sides, according to the United Nations, which estimates up to 100,000 people were killed in the conflict, with thousands of others forcibly disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Sixteen years after the war ended, families of the victims and missing are still fighting for justice and accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “One day the truth will come,” said V S Niranjan, a lawyer representing relatives of people who went missing in Jaffna.\n \n\n   \n    A blue school bag\n \n\n   \n  Just a stone’s throw from a main road, the Chemmani gravesite is one of more than 20 mass graves identified in Sri Lanka.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the gravesites that pockmark the north and east of the country are believed to contain the victims of atrocities committed during the civil war. Caught between warring rebel fighters and the Sri Lankan army, the Tamil community in these regions bore the brunt of the violence.\n \n\n   \n  The military occupied Jaffna from 1995 until the end of the war. Chemmani first gained international attention in 1998 when Sri Lankan soldier former Lance Cpl. Somaratne Rajapakse, who was on trial for the rape and murder of schoolgirl Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, confessed that hundreds of Tamils had been buried there after the Sri Lankan army retook Jaffna.\n \n\n   \n  For decades, the mass grave remained hidden until construction workers clearing land in the grounds of a Hindu cemetery in February unearthed human skeletal remains.\n \n\n   \n  Their discovery prompted a court-ordered forensic excavation of the site in May and June, which initially uncovered 19 skeletons.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the bones of hundreds more people have been found.\n \n\n   \n  A baby’s milk bottle, a blue schoolbag, bangles and cloth fragments have been uncovered alongside the bones.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of the remains had no form of clothing. The bodies were buried in a disordered way, heaped together in shallow graves of 1.5-2 feet, according to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, an independent national body that investigates violations of fundamental rights.\n \n\n   \n  Tamils, who have lived in the north and east of Sri Lanka for thousands of years, are primarily followers of Hinduism, with a significant Christian minority population, but the commission  determined  that the fact the bodies were buried naked rules out customary Hindu burials. “There is a reasonable likelihood that the burials were unlawful and pursuant to extrajudicial killings,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Teams of archaeologists, crime scene officers, and forensic medicine specialists under the jurisdiction of the Jaffna magistrate were working at the site digging, dusting and storing the remains. As investigators carefully chipped away the earth at one location, the head of a skeleton slowly emerged from the dirt, followed by a torso, arms and the rest of the body.\n \n\n   \n  Equipped with fine tools, shovels and hammers, they meticulously separated earth and rock from bone, often using their gloved hands to sweep away the dirt.\n \n\n   \n  One small, rectangular block of earth has been cut out of the ground. A tiny spine and rib cage can be made out – the remains of what investigators believe was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  “There are children with a doll we recovered… These are very disturbing things,” said Niranjan, the lawyer who attended the gravesite every day to monitor the excavation on behalf of the families.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators   in September appealed to the Jaffna court for a greater area to be mapped and excavated as ground radar suggests additional human remains could be buried there. But by the end of November, work had not restarted.\n \n\n   \n  Amnesty International estimated as many as 100,000 people were “forcibly disappeared” – the secret arrest, imprisonment or abduction of a person with the blessing of state organizations, or rebel groups – in Sri Lanka during the war, and the United Nations Human Rights Office has laid most of the blame on Sri Lankan security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups.\n \n\n   \n  CNN sent repeated and detailed requests for comment about the Chemmani gravesite and allegations of wartime abuses to the Sri Lankan army, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice. The army directed CNN to a defense ministry spokesperson who said the matter “is being handled purely by the law enforcement authorities under the supervision of the judiciary.” Sri Lankan Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara said he was not available to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances in Geneva on September 29, Nanayakkara said the Sri Lankan government “believed in securing justice for the victims and finding truth and closure, in line with its commitment with human rights and fundamental freedoms.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Where is my child?’\n \n\n   \n  Mothers and widows are leading the charge in Sri Lanka demanding answers.\n \n\n   \n  For more than 30 years they have struggled to find out what happened to their loved ones, pressing the government and authorities through the courts and on the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Previous investigations into other gravesites were not successful in identifying victims, did not lead to prosecutions, or were halted due to lack of funds or political will.\n \n\n   \n  Clutching photos of their missing relatives, hundreds of residents marched in the stifling heat from Jaffna to the Chemmani gravesite on August 30, calling for independent international oversight of the investigation because they don’t trust the local justice system to give them answers.\n \n\n   \n  “Where are our children?” the protesters chanted.\n \n\n   \n  Each came with similar stories – a husband, a brother, a son; sometimes a whole family missing, without a trace.\n \n\n   \n  At the protest, Sivapatham Elangkothai dropped to the dusty ground, and in an expression of grief and anger slammed her hand to her head and heart.\n \n\n   \n  “Where are you? I want to see you all, I want you all to come to me,” she cried.\n \n\n   \n  Elangkothai, who helped to organize the protest, held a photo of her daughter, son-in-law and her three young grandchildren, who she hasn’t seen in more than 16 years.\n \n\n   \n  Back at her house in Jaffna, she recounted their last months together.\n \n\n   \n  Like many others living in the north and east of Sri Lanka during the war, intense fighting had forced Elangkothai’s family to flee their home.\n \n\n   \n  They ended up in Vavuniya, a strategically important district for the Sri Lankan army as a gateway to the largely Tamil-controlled northeast.\n \n\n   \n  In late 2008, Elangkothai’s daughter gave birth to her third child – another grandchild for Elangkothai and her husband to dote on.\n \n\n   \n  “We loved them dearly,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the family was split between north and south Vavuniya, and when the Sri Lankan army began its final and most bloody assault, they became separated forever.\n \n\n   \n  Elangkothai later learned through family friends that her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren were herded onto a military bus, along with other residents, and taken away by Sri Lankan army soldiers. Her youngest grandchild was just 7 months old at the time.\n \n\n   \n  At her home in Jaffna, surrounded by photos of her family, Elangkothai hugged two saris that belonged to her daughter.\n \n\n   \n  “When I hear a knock at the door, I think it’s my child,” she said. “I searched everywhere for them. They aren’t to be found.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite filing multiple affidavits and appeals to the government, Elangkothai still does not know what happened to her family.\n \n\n   \n  She now assists the Jaffna branch of the Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances, a civil society group of Tamil families of the disappeared that holds regular protests and pushes for accountability from the state.\n \n\n   \n  “What was our crime? Was it being born a Tamil?” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Investigations\n \n\n   \n  UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk laid flowers at a vigil demanding justice near the Chemmani mass grave in June.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, an opportunity presents itself for Sri Lanka to break from the past,” said Türk, after he visited the gravesite, and called for “a clear and formal acknowledgment of the violations, abuses and crimes that occurred, including during the civil war.”\n \n\n   \n  Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office last year, has promised to restore trust, investigate crimes and bring justice to victims’ families. The government said it would establish a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate wartime abuses in Sri Lanka, and an independent public prosecutor’s office.\n \n\n   \n  But the discovery of the Chemmani mass graves has strengthened calls from Tamils for international justice, including referring Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court.\n \n\n   \n  Those calls for an international investigation appeared to have been shut down in September when Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath  told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva  that accountability would be handled “through credible domestic processes” as “external action will only serve to create divisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Herath said investigations into the Chemmani gravesite are being conducted “independent of any government interference” and “the government has and will continue to provide adequate resources for the related processes.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, successive Sri Lankan governments have established various state-run commissions of inquiry and investigative bodies, but they have had little success in bringing perpetrators to account.\n \n\n   \n  Families of victims, human rights defenders and international bodies such as the UN have criticized the commissions for a lack of transparency, for being ineffective and ultimately unfit for delivering accountability.\n \n\n   \n  The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) was established in 2017 with an explicit mandate to establish the fate of missing persons. It has records of more than 23,000 cases, but has traced just 23 people, a Sri Lankan delegation told the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances on September 29.\n \n\n   \n  The UN human rights office said the OMP’s independence had been “undermined” by “appointing members lacking credibility and independence” and it had lost the trust of victim communities.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the OMP for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The Sri Lankan delegation told the UN committee that “Sri Lanka had a long-standing practice of investigating complaints of disappearances” and “all investigations of mass graves were carried out with judicial oversight in accordance with legal standards.”\n \n\n   \n  The government was “working on addressing” challenges within the OMP, had allocated additional funding to the body and hoped to “achieve positive results through its investigations and gain public trust,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Sri Lanka’s government “had the political will to investigate cases of enforced disappearance” and was “working to introduce a new system to compensate victims’ families,” the delegation said.\n \n\n   \n    Scars of war remain\n \n\n   \n  Mary Ranjini Nirmalanathan is in her 70s and spent her whole life in Jaffna.\n \n\n   \n  She and her husband saved hard to build their dream home but it sat between an army camp and the Jaffna hospital, and as the war intensified around them, they were forced to abandon it, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband did some work for the army as a translator – Nirmalanathan thought it would offer them some protection. But one day in 1990, he didn’t return from the army base.\n \n\n   \n  Nirmalanathan said she used to go to the military camp demanding answers from the soldiers. As a lone woman with two young children in tow, she said she feared for her life and that of her sons.\n \n\n   \n  Soldiers would say her husband was working and fine.\n \n\n   \n  Weeks became months, months became years, and her husband never returned home.\n \n\n   \n  Her two boys grew up without a father and carried the trauma of war.\n \n\n   \n  “They saw children their own age die before their eyes,” Nirmalanathan said. “When there was an airstrike, the children would run to the bunkers. That’s how they played. We did not teach them. Even while studying, if they saw a plane, they would drop everything and hide.”\n \n\n   \n  She would tell her children that, one day, their father would come home.\n \n\n   \n  But the fighting got worse. She applied for passports for her sons to move away from Sri Lanka – to join the huge exodus of Tamils who fled to Europe, India, Canada and elsewhere during the war.\n \n\n   \n  In 2007, tragedy struck again. The morning that her eldest son’s passport arrived, he was taken on a motorbike by soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  Her son, 19 at the time, was last seen at a massive army camp near the airport in Jaffna. She has had no word from him since.\n \n\n   \n  Today, she and other women hold a protest every month demanding answers and an international investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Nirmalanathan said she faces harassment from the authorities for her protests. Some nights, between 2 and 4 a.m., she sees and hears security personnel outside her door.\n \n\n   \n  She believes it’s an intimidation tactic to stop her galvanizing other family members.\n \n\n   \n  United Nations observers noted in a report released in August “continued patterns of surveillance, intimidation and harassment of families of the disappeared, community leaders, civil society actors, especially those working on accountability for enforced disappearances and other conflict-related crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking in Geneva in September at the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances,   a Sri Lankan government representative accused freelance Tamil journalist Kumanan Kanapathipillai, one of the authors of this CNN report, of “terrorist activities and financial crime.” Kanapathipillai had previously been brought in for questioning by counter-terrorism police following his reporting on the Chemmani mass graves.\n \n\n   \n  The Committee to Protect Journalists and several other press advocate groups called on the government to end its “harassment” of Kanapathipillai. More than 100 other Sri Lankan organizations and individuals  issued a joined  statement saying the “ill-founded accusations and persistent harassment are an attempt to silence” Kanapathipillai, and serve as “a warning to other Tamil-speaking journalists and activists” working on historic and continued repression of the Tamil community.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Foreign Minister Herath  said the government  “will not hesitate to take action on any alleged harassment or intimidation.”\n \n\n   \n  The discovery of the Chemmani gravesite reopened old wounds but also gave many mothers like Nirmalanathan hope that some answers may finally come.\n \n\n   \n  “Today there is a reason why the relatives come and sob. After all these years they strongly believe that (their loved ones) will come home… many mothers just like me are waiting with so much hope,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our loved ones couldn’t speak up when they were alive, now their bodies are coming out to tell the truth.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/europe/pope-leo-istanbul-blue-mosque-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-05:00","title":"Pope Leo removes shoes but does not appear to pray in first mosque visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV made his first visit to a mosque since being elected, touring the historic Blue Mosque in Istanbul with local Muslim leaders.

Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Pope Leo  XIV has made his first visit to a mosque since his election, and while he removed his shoes as a sign of respect, he did not appear to pray.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday,  Leo  went to the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, a 17th-century place of worship considered an Ottoman-era architectural masterpiece, with turquoise ceramic tiles adorning its walls and dome.\n \n\n   \n   Leo , accompanied by local Muslim leaders, walked through the mosque’s courtyard and, after taking off his shoes, was shown around the interior in his white socks. The first American pope, who is a keen Chicago White Sox baseball fan, recently joked that he always wears “white socks.”\n \n\n   \n  Aşgın Tunca, a Muezzin, said Leo had been invited to pray during his visit. A Muezzin is an official who calls Muslims to prayer and who had been among those showing Leo around the Blue Mosque.\n \n\n   \n  “I offered [to] him, if he would like to worship here, but he said ‘no, I am just going to look around,” Tunca said afterwards, explaining that “they told me” the pope was going to “pray here”.\n \n\n   \n  There was further confusion when the Vatican press office sent out a statement after the visit saying Leo had prayed at the mosque and that he had been welcomed by the head of Turkey’s state-run religious body, despite neither event occurring. The Vatican later said the statement, which referred to Leo observing “a brief moment of prayer,” had been sent in error and taken from the booklet produced before the trip.\n \n\n   \n  Leo is the third pope to visit the Blue Mosque. Past papal visits have raised questions as to whether the pope would pray.\n \n\n   \n  In 2014, Pope Francis spent two minutes in silent prayer while at the mosque, and in 2006, Pope Benedict XVI observed what the Vatican described as a moment of “silent meditation,” and which some saw as the first time a pope had prayed in a Muslim place of worship.\n \n\n   \n  Following Leo’s visit, the Vatican said the pope “visited the Mosque in silence, in a spirit of reflection and listening, with profound respect for the place and the faith of those gathered here in prayer.”\n \n\n   \n  The first pope to visit a mosque was John Paul II, who visited one in Syria in 2001. The last sixty years has seen the Catholic Church engage in an active dialogue with the Muslim world.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo recently marked the 60th anniversary of a landmark church declaration on inter-religious cooperation, which hundreds of religious leaders attended at the Vatican.\n \n\n   \n  Later on Saturday, Leo met privately with leaders of local Christian churches before attending a service at the Patriarchal Church of St. George alongside Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Emphasizing one of the main messages of Leo’s trip, the two men spoke of the “fraternal” bonds that now exist between the two branches of Christianity, which split in 1054 in the “great schism” due to theological differences that caused division for centuries.\n \n\n   \n  The two church leaders then signed a joint declaration after the service, rejecting “any use of religion and the name of God to justify violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “We believe that authentic interreligious dialogue, far from being a cause of syncretism and confusion, is essential for the coexistence of peoples of different traditions and cultures,” the joint declaration added.\n \n\n   \n  At a mass attended by thousands at Istanbul’s Volkswagen Arena, Leo then delivered a homily where he spoke about the importance of Catholics fostering bonds with other religions.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to walk together by appreciating what unites us, breaking down the walls of prejudice and mistrust, promoting mutual knowledge and esteem in order to give to all a strong message of hope and an invitation to become ‘peacemakers,’” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Catholic community in Turkey is very small, and numbers around 33,000 according to Vatican statistics. They are a diverse group made up of different ethnic minorities – including Armenians and Assyrians – along with a large number of immigrants. Flags from different countries were on display at the mass and there was excitement among the roughly 3,000 people who attended.\n \n\n   \n  Some attendees were wearing T-shirts of Leo, some shouted “Viva il Papa,” and one woman was waving a flag which included the colors of both Turkey and the Vatican.\n \n\n   \n  The liturgy was celebrated in different languages including Turkish, English, Latin, Armenian and Aramaic, which also reflected the different church traditions in Turkey. A simultaneous translation of everything in Turkish was beamed on a big screen. Pope Leo delivered his homily in English.

Australia’s about to find out \n       \n  By Hilary Whiteman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s August, and a show of hands in an auditorium filled with 300 students at All Saints Anglican School in Australia shows that few of the Grade 9 and 10 students sitting in plush red seats had heard of the country’s impending ban on social media, much less how to prepare for it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very important to save photos,” Kirra Pendergast, founder of cyber safety organization Ctrl+Shft, lectures from the stage. “You need to prepare.”\n \n\n   \n  An alarmed murmur spreads around the room as the students realize what’s about to be lost. “Can you get your account back when you turn 16?” one girl asks. “What if I lie about my age?” asks another.\n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks before the ban, we have more answers.\n \n\n   \n  From December 10, sites that meet the Australian government’s definition of an “age-restricted social media platform” will need to show that they’re doing enough to eject or block children under 16 or face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million).\n \n\n   \n  The list includes Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X, and YouTube. The government says it’s protecting children from potentially harmful content; the sites say they’re already building safer systems.\n \n\n   \n  Meta says it’ll start deactivating accounts and blocking new Facebook, Instagram and Threads accounts  from December 4.  Under-16s are being encouraged to download their content.\n \n\n   \n  Snap says users can deactivate their accounts for up to three years, or until they turn 16. Snap streaks – the daily swapping of photos of ordinary life, vacations, walls, foreheads, anything to signal an online presence – will end.\n \n\n   \n  There’s another sting in the ban, too, coming at the end of the Australian school year before the summer break in the southern hemisphere. For eight weeks, there’ll be no school, no teachers – and no scrolling.\n \n\n   \n  For millions of children, it could be the first school break they spend in years without the company of time-killing social media algorithms, or an easy way to contact their friends. Even for parents who support the ban, it could be a very long summer.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries around the world are taking notes as Australia explores new territory that some say mirrors safety evolutions of years past – the dawning realization that maybe cars need safety belts, and that perhaps cigarettes should come with some kind of health warning.\n \n\n   \n  As with any seismic step in social policy, there are cheer squads, naysayers and those who don’t care what Australia – a country known to love rules – is doing to (and for) its children. But leaders in other countries are closely watching Australia’s eSafety tzar and are crafting their own legislation, so there’s every chance that bans will spread.\n \n\n   \n    Strap in for change\n \n\n   \n  Julie Dawson remembers bouncing around the back seat of a car at age 5.\n \n\n   \n  “I can remember going on those long car journeys where, literally, we didn’t have any seat belts,” said Dawson, the chief regulatory and policy officer at Yoti, a UK-based digital identity company. “You probably wouldn’t do that with your 5-year-old now on a 10-hour journey, but that’s what I remember growing up.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s no surprise that a senior executive in the age verification industry might think that erecting barriers is a good thing, but Dawson frames the social media ban as a natural evolution.\n \n\n   \n  “People have basically thought, what is it we do offline? Do we let young people into strip clubs, into bars, buying alcohol, buying cigarettes? What are the norms that we have and what are the norms that we want to have online?”\n \n\n   \n  Yoti advises social media platforms including Meta about their age verification options. The group now has 12 methods, including phone, email, and ID checks, and the list is growing. Age-restricted sites give users a choice about which method they’d prefer.\n \n\n   \n  “The one around the world that most people go to when they have several options is facial age estimation,” Dawson said. Video selfies are used to analyze facial features like skin texture and bone structure to guess a person’s age in a matter of seconds. The legislation doesn’t require people to upload official government ID.\n \n\n   \n  However, assessing the age of “borderline” teenagers, say 15-to-17-year-olds, can be difficult and some over-16s may need to show an “identity document” to avoid the ban, said Andy Lulham, the chief operating officer of Verifymy, another London-based age verification company whose clients include YouTube.\n \n\n   \n  “Not every 16-year-old or 17-year-old will necessarily own, or have access to an identity document, and that is where I personally think there’s a bit of uncertainty in terms of how platforms are going to solve that issue,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Australian teens were taking notes when their British counterparts attempted to bypass new age restrictions under the UK’s Online Safety Act with cheap face masks and images of video game characters.\n \n\n   \n  Lulham says those tricks are likely to be detected by anti-spoofing technology, which includes liveness checks to see if a real person is in front of the camera.\n \n\n   \n  Virtual private networks are also a tried and tested workaround. But while logging in via a VPN network may be useful in accessing banned content like porn, Lulham says, he doesn’t see it catching on for social media.\n \n\n   \n  “Social media platforms rely more on localization, context to where you’re located, your friends, your connections, who you follow, using your region,” he said. “So, I think using a VPN in the world of social media will have a more negative impact on that user’s experience.”\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Dawson suggests that while platforms will have to pull up the drawbridge to under-16s, the castle won’t be completely impenetrable. The legislation puts the onus solely on tech companies to take “reasonable steps” to keep under-16s off their platforms – there are no penalties for children, or their parents, if they use banned apps.\n \n\n   \n  “(The government’s) not there to penalize those young people that are two months off their 16th birthday,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Dawson said if she was a teen, she’d likely be looking for security gaps. “I’m sure I’d be one of those with my sleeves rolled up,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Teens on TikTok are not happy\n \n\n   \n  Shar, a 15-year-old aspiring singer, knows the highs and lows of social media.\n \n\n   \n  She was bullied online so badly that she moved schools, but she also relies on social media to promote her music and doesn’t want to lose it.\n \n\n   \n  “It took me so long to gain 4,000 followers on my main account from posting, and I’m going to lose all of that,” she said. “Every last person that I’ve gathered to listen to my music – gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Like other teen content creators, she’s now urging her followers to move with her to Lemon8, an app owned by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance that hasn’t been banned.\n \n\n   \n  Shar’s father, Richie Sharland, says if he had his time again, he would have delayed her access to social media. “I would have left it till she was probably 13 or 14 and had a bit more maturity to handle what was going on. It’s not her, it’s all kids,” he adds.\n \n\n   \n  Teen influencer Zoey is also railing against the ban. She uses TikTok to connect  with some 48,000 followers , posting #grwm (get ready with me) and unboxing videos, and – more recently – advice for under-16s about how to evade age detection.\n \n\n   \n  “Change your email address on your social media accounts to your parent’s email,” advised Zoey, whose own account includes her father’s name. (TikTok says the name of the account doesn’t matter – their technology can detect who’s using it most often).\n \n\n   \n  Zoey’s parents support her use of social media and believe it’s been good for her. “What she’s done and how she’s gone about it, it’s amazing. It really is,” Mark, her father, told the “Youth Jam” podcast.\n \n\n   \n  Zoey started a petition calling for the age limit on the social media ban to be lowered to 13, which had garnered more  than 43,000 signatures  by the time it closed on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Grade 9 student Maxine Steel didn’t sign it. She deleted her social media apps last year, after finding it too difficult to stop scrolling. Right now, she doesn’t have a phone at all.\n \n\n   \n  For the last term of this school year, she’s at a leadership camp in Victoria state’s High Country with 40 or so other 14-year-old students at the Alpine School, where phones are banned.\n \n\n   \n  “In the first week … we were all discussing about how we missed everyone, we couldn’t talk to our friends, and we just, like, missed scrolling,” Maxine said during a school-approved call.\n \n\n   \n  “Now we’ve really settled in, everyone’s forgotten about social media, and I have to say, it is the most vivid and animated environment I think I’ve ever been in my whole life.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxine is a member of Project Rockit’s National Youth Collective – a group of 50 young people across Australia who inform programs combating bullying, hate and prejudice.\n \n\n   \n  Project Rockit works in schools and provides safety advice to tech companies including Snapchat, Spotify and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Thomas, Project Rockit’s co-founder and CEO, says while Maxine has found it empowering to log off social media, other kids are feeling genuine grief about losing their connection with support groups and others like them.\n \n\n   \n  “Young people’s relationships with these platforms are really complex and diverse, and while some thrive without them, others really do utilize social media as their primary way to stay connected,” said Thomas.\n \n\n   \n  The National Youth Collective is currently brainstorming ways to reach out to isolated, marginalized and lonely children. “The last thing we want is for them to pop up on more dangerous, less regulated spaces as a result of a policy that was intended to keep them safer,” said Thomas.\n \n\n   \n    Campaigns snowball\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth remembering how we got here. The origins of the ban are widely attributed to the wife of an Australian state premier who had read “The Anxious Generation” by US psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt and urged her husband to do something about it.\n \n\n   \n  In his book, Haidt attributes the rise of mental health issues in children and young adults to the lack of unsupervised outdoor play and the proliferation of smartphones.\n \n\n   \n  South Australia launched an inquiry into how a ban might work, before the idea spread nationwide backed by campaigns launched by News Corporation, which dominates Australia’s media landscape, and a Sydney radio presenter who publicized the stories of families who’d lost children to suicide caused by online bullying under a  campaign called “36 Months.” \n \n\n   \n  The national bill – passed on the  final day of parliament  last year – was criticized at the time as a rushed piece of legislation conceived to win votes before the 2025 election.\n \n\n   \n  Just this week, the Digital Freedom Project, a campaign group formed to fight the ban, filed a case in Australia’s High Court arguing that it’s a “blatant attack” on the constitutional rights of young Australians to political speech. The group’s president is a Libertarian Party member of the New South Wales state parliament who has previously lobbied   against government health restrictions. Any court hearing will take time.\n \n\n   \n  Communications Minister Anika Wells hit back in Federal Parliament Wednesday. “We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we stand firm.”\n \n\n   \n  Other countries are proposing their own restrictions.  Malaysia this week  became the latest to join a list that includes Denmark, Norway and countries across the European Union, pushed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s Online Safety Act  threatens multimillion-dollar fines for companies that fail to take appropriate steps to protect children from harmful content. And at least 20 US states have enacted laws relating to children and social media this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but none as sweeping as an outright ban.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, hundreds of individuals, school districts and attorneys general from across the US have filed a complaint against Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat alleging they  deliberately embedded addictive features  into their platforms to drive advertising revenue, to the detriment of children’s mental health.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for Meta, TikTok, and Snap said the filing paints a misleading picture of their platforms and safety efforts.  YouTube has been approached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pendergast, the  Ctrl+Shft  chief digital strategist, said action to limit the freedom of big tech companies is long overdue.\n \n\n   \n  She’s spoken to thousands of Australian children about social media delay – including those at All Saints Anglican School – and is confident that it will make them safer in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’ll be very different next year. It will take a minute, but we need to make sure that parents know how to teach their children… (about) what to keep and what not to keep, and start to explore safer spaces for them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  However, Nicky Buckley, head of student engagement and culture for All Saints’ junior school, doesn’t expect to notice much of a change in 2026. “I just don’t think some parents are strong enough to remove it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Her concerns extend to the gaming sites the government has explicitly said won’t be included in the ban, like Roblox, Discord, and Steam.\n \n\n   \n  “It absolutely terrifies me,” she said. “I’ve got children as young as year two online and messaging strangers, and it’s not okay.”\n \n\n   \n  Buckley says a group of girls recently told her their 7-year-old friend was on a gaming site talking to a stranger, who had asked her where she lived. Buckley informed her mother, who had no idea she was talking to people online.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox, one of the gaming sites routinely accused of failing to do enough to protect children from online predators, announced in late November plans to  require age verification for chats . For some parents, it’s not enough.\n \n\n   \n  Buckley said parents at All Saints had formed a club to push back on smartphone use, where they swap book titles and news articles about the perils of social media.\n \n\n   \n  “At our first meeting, we had 76 parents turn up, which blew our minds,” said Buckley. “You couldn’t hold back the passion. Everyone was talking over the top, and they were banding together, just we, we need to come together and stop this.”\n \n\n   \n  Maxine, the 14-year-old who took herself off social media, says in some ways she’s looking forward to not being the only one missing out on the latest gossip and memes.\n \n\n   \n  Her message to other kids her age is to enjoy the serenity before everyone logs on again at 16.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re about my age, you’ll have it back next year anyway, so why not have 365 days of peace and silence, where you just focus on yourself and try to enjoy your last years of childhood before you start growing up.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/travel/travel-news-thanksgiving-love-friendship","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-04:00","title":"A Hospital in a Foreign Land is the Last Place Anyone Thinks They’ll Fall in Love — Real-Life Romance Stories from Around the World","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This CNN Travel feature highlights five real-life stories of profound human connections formed across cultures and unexpected settings, from a hospital in India to a farmhouse in Missouri.

Scher.\n \n\n   \n  Amy had never considered a relationship with a woman before, but she felt instantly connected to Charlotte and invited her to dinner. On their date, they talked and laughed for hours and the friendship grew closer.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember we were sitting on the steps of the hospital, and she was showing me something on her phone and I remember wanting to kiss her,” says Amy.\n \n\n   \n   Here’s what happened next .\n \n\n   \n    A Goldilocks for the 1980s\n \n\n   \n  It was the night before Thanksgiving 1980 and a blizzard was raging in Missouri.\n \n\n   \n  When 18-year-old John Morris’ car spun off the road, the pragmatic — or “naive” — teenager sought out the only shelter that was available: a clapboard farmhouse, set back from the road.\n \n\n   \n  No one was home, so he tried calling the tow company (no answer) and then washed up some dishes as a good deed for his unknown hosts.\n \n\n   \n  John had settled in for the night and was just wondering if he could help himself to the food in the fridge when he heard voices on the other side of the front door.\n \n\n   \n  His encounter with the owners turned into a  surprising night  for all of them.\n \n\n   \n    In the footsteps of her father\n \n\n   \n  Mayumi Maruyama grew up in a suburban house outside Detroit.

far-right party sets up its new youth wing as thousands protest \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:22 AM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A confident far-right  Alternative for Germany  set up its new youth organization on Saturday even as thousands of protesters converged on the western city of Giessen, where the party held its meeting, some of them clashing with police.\n \n\n   \n  A convention of the anti-immigration party, known by its German acronym AfD, started more than two hours late after groups of protesters blocked or tried to block roads in and around the city of some 93,000, delaying many delegates’ arrival.\n \n\n   \n  Police said they used pepper spray after stones were thrown at officers at one location. In another case, police said they used water cannons to clear a blockade by some 2,000 protesters after they ignored calls to leave. They did so again Saturday afternoon as a group tried to break through barriers toward the city’s convention center.\n \n\n   \n  Police said up to 5,000 officers were deployed and 10 to 15 were lightly injured. Many people demonstrated peacefully; police put the overall number of protesters by early afternoon in the “lower five-digit” region.\n \n\n   \n  AfD’s leaders condemned the protests as the meeting opened. “What is being done out there – dear left-wingers, dear extremists, you need to look at yourselves – is something that is deeply undemocratic,” party co-leader Alice Weidel said. She said that one AfD lawmaker was attacked; police said a lawmaker had been injured near Giessen but didn’t give details.\n \n\n   \n    Previous youth organization was dissolved in March\n \n\n   \n  The new youth organization’s predecessor, the Young Alternative – a largely autonomous group with relatively loose links to the party – was dissolved at the end of March after AfD decided to formally cut ties with it.\n \n\n   \n  AfD wants to have much closer oversight over the new group, named Generation Germany and open to all party members under 36, whose statute was approved on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  AfD finished second in  Germany’s national election  in February with over 20% of the vote and is now the country’s biggest opposition party. The party, with which mainstream parties refuse to work, has continued to rise in polls as Chancellor  Friedrich Merz ’s coalition government has failed to impress voters.\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s domestic intelligence agency had concluded that the Young Alternative was a proven right-wing extremist group. It later classified AfD itself as such a group, but suspended the designation after AfD launched a legal challenge.\n \n\n   \n  In a ruling last year rejecting a call for an injunction against the Young Alternative designation, a Cologne court argued that preserving an ethnically defined German people and the exclusion if possible of the “ethnically foreign” was a central political idea of the group.\n \n\n   \n  It also pointed to agitation against migrants and asylum-seekers, and links with extremist groups such as the Identitarian Movement. In June this year, a higher court ended the appeal process, noting that the Young Alternative had been dissolved.\n \n\n   \n  AfD’s other co-leader, Tino Chrupalla, said the party must learn from past mistakes.\n \n\n   \n  “Some benefited from the young, from their ability to mobilize, but didn’t have the well-being and future of this youth sufficiently in sight,” he said. “We should have taken more care of the young new hopes in our party; it will be different in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that the young activists must “put themselves at the party’s service.”\n \n\n   \n    Party portrays itself as anti-establishment force\n \n\n   \n  It’s typical for German parties to have youth wings, which are generally more politically radical than the parent parties. It remains to be seen whether the new AfD youth organization will be more moderate than its predecessor, with at least some continuity expected.\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Dorow, a delegate from Germany’s northern Schleswig-Holstein state, said he was previously active in the local branch of the Young Alternative.\n \n\n   \n  “The new formation means above all continuing what the Young Alternative started – being a training ground, attracting young people … and above all bringing them into politics for the good of the party,” in which they could take on offices at some point, he said. He said he hadn’t seen any “drift in a radical direction” in the Young Alternative.\n \n\n   \n  AfD portrays itself as an anti-establishment force at a time of low trust in politicians. It first entered the national parliament in 2017 on the back of discontent with the arrival of large numbers of migrants in the mid-2010s, and curbing migration remains its signature theme. But it has shown a talent for capitalizing on discontent about other issues too in recent years. That was reflected in the confident tone of AfD’s leaders Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Five of Germany’s 16 states hold regional elections next year. Two of those are in the ex-communist east, where the party is strongest.\n \n\n   \n  “We will get the majority of mandates; we will provide our first governor,” Weidel said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/style/miss-universe-pageant-controversy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"09:50:00-05:00","title":"This year’s Miss Universe debacle shows how beauty pageants turned ugly","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Miss Universe pageant faced a major scandal involving allegations of vote-rigging, secret pre-selection of finalists, and conflicts of interest.

      \nUpdated: \n        9:50 AM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And for the scandal-ridden  Miss Universe pageant , this is proving a big part of the problem.\n \n\n   \n  Opaque and subjective voting criteria have made it difficult to untangle the web of allegations surrounding this year’s finale. The question of whether Miss Mexico, Fátima Bosch,  should  have won is no longer about how she performed on stage — it’s about allegations of vote-rigging, secrecy and  favoritism .\n \n\n   \n  One of the contest judges, Omar Harfouch, has made a plethora of damaging claims on social media since resigning from his post days before last Friday’s finale.\n \n\n   \n  Among them, the Lebanese-French composer claimed 30 finalists were preselected in a “secret vote” by an “impromptu jury” comprising of individuals not on the official judging panel (an allegation the Miss Universe Organization  denied ). Perhaps more controversially, he said that Bosch’s victory was also pre-scripted, influenced by business ties between the pageant’s co-owner and president of the Miss Universe Organization, Raúl Rocha Cantú, and the Mexican beauty queen’s father.\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Miss Universe Organization nor Rocha Cantú’s lawyer responded to CNN’s requests for comment. On the latter claim, Rocha Cantú  told  Mexican journalist Adela Micha that a contract his company held with Mexico’s state-owned oil company Pemex, to whom Bosch’s father is an advisor, was awarded via a fair public bidding process that predates his co-ownership of the Miss Universe pageant. Pemex  said  in a statement on X that it had a temporary contract with companies linked to Rocha Cantú in 2023, although it emphasized that the relationship no longer exists.\n \n\n   \n  Off-stage drama further engulfed the pageant on Wednesday when Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office announced that Rocha Cantú is  being investigated  for alleged connections to an organized crime network engaged in drug trafficking, arms trafficking and fuel theft. Rocha Cantú’s lawyer did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on those allegations, either.\n \n\n   \n  The pageant boss has, however, posted several statements and videos to social media in recent days condemning the other claims. In a defiant three-part Instagram post Rocha Cantú denied Harfouch’s allegations, calling him an “opportunist” exploiting the claims to “gain followers.”\n \n\n   \n  The fallout has been disastrous for the pageant’s organizers. Ivory Coast delegate and fourth runner-up, Olivia Yacé, who many viewers felt should have won the crown (and who Harfouch said was excluded from contention “solely because she might face visa issues”), has since renounced her Miss Universe Africa and Oceania title, saying in a carefully-worded statement that she wanted to “remain true” to her values.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, Rocha Cantú appeared to concede that the strength of competitors’ passports was among “many things to take into consideration.” Discussing Yacé’s Ivorian citizenship, in his interview with Micha, he added: “She’s going to be the Miss Universe who spent a whole year in an apartment because of the cost of the visa process with lawyers. Some of them require six months’ notice. The year’s already gone, right?”\n \n\n   \n  And even prior to the finale, the pageant had been beset with controversy. Earlier in the month, a Thai pageant director berated Bosch during a pre-pageant meeting, triggering a mass walkout of contestants.\n \n\n   \n    Reputation for scandal\n \n\n   \n  Often sitting at the intersection of politics and national pride, pageants have proven to be magnets for scandal. This year’s debacle is just the latest facing Miss Universe, its competitors and its global franchises, the network of national contests that select each country’s representative.\n \n\n   \n  In the last five years alone, local organizers have faced allegations of  discriminatory entry requirements  (France),  sexual harassment  (Indonesia) and  xenophobia  (South Africa). At Miss USA, meanwhile, 2023 winner Noelia Voigt resigned her post via a cryptic mental health-related social media  post  seemingly containing the message “I am silenced,” spelled out with the first letters of the opening 11 sentences, sparking rumors of a strict non-disclosure agreement. Days later Miss Teen USA  forfeited  her title, too.\n \n\n   \n  The kind of controversies surrounding 2025’s Miss Universe are “not at all new” in pageantry, said Hilary Levey Friedman, a sociologist and author of “ Here She Is: The Complicated Reign of the Beauty Pageant in America. ”\n \n\n   \n  “People have long said, ‘Oh my gosh, it was fixed,’ or ‘They knew someone,’ or ‘There’s this conflict of interest,’” she said, adding that business interests are, also, nothing new. “These pageants have really always had a strong commercial past, and always had a tradition of men owning them and women competing.”\n \n\n   \n  Miss Universe, which was co-owned by Donald Trump from 1996 to 2015 is, above all, a business. Organizers may arguably have a moral obligation to fairness, and a duty of care to contestants, but the competition’s integrity is, primarily, a matter of reputation. “It is not a public institution,” Rocha Cantú  reminded his critics  on Instagram earlier this week. “We do not receive public funds or sponsorships from any public entity.”\n \n\n   \n    Struggle for relevance\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, the column inches dedicated to pageant controversies have seemingly outweighed interest in the contests themselves. This raises the inevitable question: does anybody really care?\n \n\n   \n  Miss Universe may be known as the “Super Bowl” of pageants, but this year’s finale was not even broadcast on English-language television in the US. (It was only available there via streaming, although Telemundo carried live coverage in Spanish.) “That is just such a wildly enormous difference from 20 years ago, let alone 50 years ago,” said Friedman, adding: “Viewership is so down, but press coverage of the scandals is so high. It’s just fascinating.”\n \n\n   \n  Widely criticized by feminists, and others, for promoting singular beauty standards and archaic notions of womanhood, the contests’ decline points to wider societal shifts. Whether beauty pageants — events that, almost by definition, objectify women — should have  any  role in today’s world is a matter of debate. But even those who support their ongoing presence might struggle to argue that aspects of the contests are not hopelessly outdated.\n \n\n   \n  Recent changes to Miss Universe’s rules, while billed as modernizing, lag decades behind the times. New regulations finally allowing over-28s, mothers and married women to participate — a concession made, astonishingly, in this decade — were hardly revolutionary. The pageant’s swimsuit (read: bikini) contest meanwhile endures, years after competitions like Miss World and Miss America ditched theirs in favor of marginally more demure alternatives, such as athleisure parades.\n \n\n   \n  But Friedman pointed to a fundamental clash between attempts to modernize and the “glitz and glamour” the events rely on to attract audiences. “They’ve tried to become more academic, more focused on ‘platform’ issues like social service, that sort of thing,” she said. “But that’s not super exciting to watch, right?”\n \n\n   \n  “I just think there’s so many different opportunities for women these days,” said Friedman, who is also the daughter of Miss America 1970, the late Pamela Eldred. “In the past, when they were so popular, it was partially because women just didn’t have as many outlets to pursue their ambition, to pursue career paths and that sort of thing. And so, I guess on some level, you could say pageants are a victim of their own success.”\n \n\n   \n    Too little, too late\n \n\n   \n  For Miss Universe, an immediate balm might be the introduction of clearer voting criteria and auditing processes. The pageant’s organizers had previously asked accounting firm Ernst & Young to oversee voting, though it is unclear whether this year’s contest was audited (or if so, by whom). Critics quickly pointed out that the results were read from a simple piece of paper rather than removed from a sealed envelope, as was once the norm. The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to CNN’s request for clarity on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  It may simply be too late for big pageants to reform their way back to mainstream cultural relevance. But dismissing their future entirely ignores the high esteem in which they are held in many countries outside the West — in the Philippines, for instance, where pageantry has a near-national-sport status.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters also point out that many beauty queens use their platforms to advocate and fundraise for charitable causes; some have used pageants to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. This year’s Miss Philippines Ahtisa Manalo, for instance, says she  paid college fees  though a combination of scholarships and pageant prize money.\n \n\n   \n  Let us not forget, too, that it is often the women themselves, not organizers, who suffer during these scandals. Earlier this week, Bosch posted screenshots of the litany of abusive messages sent to her by social media users unhappy with last Friday’s result. “In recent days, I have received insults, attacks and even death threats for one reason only: because I won,” she wrote on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  But Bosch’s ability to speak out exemplifies one way in which pageantry is, Friedman said, changing for the better. If social media is increasingly the source of controversy for franchise owners, it has simultaneously empowered contestants by expanding their platforms and allowing them to raise concerns publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what’s different is that people now have a way to get their message out in a way they didn’t before,” Friedman said, adding: “The #MeToo movement and centering of women’s narratives has led to women having more of a public voice. And ironically, or not, that has happened in pageantry as well.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/us/a320-series-fixes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"10:50:00-05:00","title":"Airlines race to fix Airbus planes after warning solar radiation could cause pilots to lose control","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Airbus has issued a safety alert regarding a rare solar radiation-induced vulnerability in its A320 family of aircraft, including A319, A320, and A321 models, which may cause data corruption in flight control systems.

\nUpdated: \n        10:50 AM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Airlines around the world are racing to avoid widespread cancellations by fixing thousands of Airbus aircraft that need immediate maintenance to protect from a problem that injured passengers and caused an emergency landing last month.\n \n\n   \n  Plane manufacturer Airbus found intense solar storms, like solar flares, could cause pilots to lose control of the Airbus A320 series of planes, including A319, A320, and A321s.\n \n\n   \n  About 6,000 of the single-aisle planes, which are the bestselling passenger aircraft in the world, need the repairs, but disruption so far has been minimal.\n \n\n   \n  “Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls,” Airbus said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  On October 30, JetBlue Flight 1230 — an A320 — was flying from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, when it suddenly dove down in altitude. The pilots made an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida, where about 15 people were taken to a hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Airbus investigated the incident and on Friday told airlines in an “Alert Operators Transmission” that the fix was needed. The company believes it is the only time this specific problem has happened, but says it “proactively worked with aviation authorities … keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.”\n \n\n   \n  Most planes can be repaired in about two hours by simply reverting to the previous software, Airbus told CNN on Saturday, meaning that disruption seems relatively limited despite it being one of the busiest travel weekends for Americans celebrating Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  However, for about 900 of the older aircraft affected, the fix is more complicated since they will need to have new hardware manually installed.\n \n\n   \n  The Airbus A320 series has what’s called fly-by-wire controls: physical movements from the pilot run through computers which, in turn, adjust the plane’s control surfaces.\n \n\n   \n  An airworthiness directive from the European Union requires airlines to make the repairs before the planes can carry passengers again.\n \n\n   \n  The airlines’ scrambled repairs seemed to avoid any widespread disruption by Saturday morning. Arrivals boards at major airport hubs like Dallas Fort Worth, Dubai, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, Tokyo Haneda and London Heathrow indicated that most flights were running on time, or with short delays.\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines had completed all except four of the 209 aircraft that needed to be updated by Saturday morning, less than the 340 it had earlier predicted, according to a statement from the airline.\n \n\n   \n  American initially warned of “some delays” as a result of the work, but it said on Saturday it expected no further operational impact. It hopes to have all of the repairs made by Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines said fewer than 50 of its A321neo aircraft will be impacted and the work should be complete by Saturday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “As safety comes before everything else, Delta will fully comply with a directive and expects any resulting operational impact to be limited,” the airline said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Six planes in United Airlines’ fleet are affected and there will be “minor disruption to a few flights,” the carrier said.\n \n\n   \n  JetBlue, which operates a fleet mostly made up of A320 and A321 aircraft, did not say how many of their planes needed to be fixed, but told CNN in a statement it has already started repairs.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams are doing everything possible to minimize disruptions to customers as this work is completed,” JetBlue said. “We will notify customers of any flight changes and customers can always check their flight status on jetblue.com or on the JetBlue app.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, Jetstar Airways Australia and Air New Zealand have also taken precautionary measures. IndiGo and Air India Express are expecting to complete the fix on their aircraft by Saturday, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Thirty-four of Jetstar’s 85 Airbus A320s are affected by the issue, the airline said. Around 90 flights have been canceled overall, affecting thousands of passengers, and further disruptions are expected through Sunday, chief pilot Tyrone Simes told reporters at Melbourne Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Airbus and the European Aviation Safety Authority have told airlines to reverse the upgrade before letting affected planes fly again, Simes said.\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, Lufthansa, Aer Lingus, Wizz Air, EasyJet and British Airways all said some of their aircraft were affected but downplayed the effect of that on their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the papal plane — known as “Shepherd One” — was also affected by the issue, though the Vatican said the necessary updates were carried out Saturday afternoon, so Pope Leo’s trip to Turkey and Lebanon will proceed with the same plane.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Pete Muntean, Taylor Romaine, Laura Sharman and Christopher Lamb contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/politics/tennessee-special-election-behn-van-epps-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"How far can Democrats ride the affordability argument?

ride the affordability argument? A progressive running in deep-red Tennessee is about to find out \n       \n  By Arit John, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Aftyn Behn, the Democratic nominee for next week’s special election in a heavily Republican Tennessee congressional district, has made affordability concerns a centerpiece of her campaign messaging –  mirroring the playbook  of the party’s victorious candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s contest is poised to test just how far Democrats can ride that argument in a district that  President Donald Trump  carried by 22 points last November.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are hoping the district’s partisan lean, combined with Behn’s progressive profile and recently resurfaced remarks on policing and other issues, will tilt the race in their favor. Democrats, meanwhile, are banking that voters’ frustration over the GOP agenda in Washington could help them significantly overperform in a race that otherwise wouldn’t be competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve always said, I don’t care who you voted for,” Behn told CNN in an interview. “I don’t care what political party you belong to, but if you are upset about the cost of living and the chaos of Washington, then I’m your candidate, and I welcome you with open arms.”\n \n\n   \n  The 7th Congressional District, which became vacant earlier this year  when former GOP Rep. Mark Green resigned , includes parts of Nashville but is largely rural, stretching from the state’s border with Kentucky in the north to Alabama in the south. As part of the 2022 redistricting process, Tennessee GOP lawmakers  redrew Nashville  from one solidly Democratic district – long held by moderate Rep. Jim Cooper – into three seats that favored Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Republicans’ advantage in the district, Democrats saw an opportunity to go on offense after their party’s total vote count in  the October primary  came about 6,000 shy of the number of ballots cast in the GOP primary. Behn, a state representative and progressive organizer, narrowly won the four-way Democratic primary. Matt Van Epps, a combat veteran and member of the Tennessee Army National Guard running with Trump’s endorsement, beat 10 other candidates to win the Republican nomination.\n \n\n   \n    Drawing national attention\n \n\n   \n  The special election has attracted millions of dollars in spending from outside groups and visits from national figures such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, with both parties eyeing it as the last major gauge of the country’s political environment before the calendar turns to 2026.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump will hold his second tele-rally for Van Epps, this time alongside House Speaker Mike Johnson, the candidate’s campaign confirmed. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will also hold a tele-rally for Behn the same day, a source familiar told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Of the more than $4 million spent on advertising in the race since the October primary, according to AdImpact, nearly $2.5 million has come from Republicans – much of that focused on painting Behn as out-of-step with the district, highlighting her past comments on topics such as defunding the police. One ad from the Trump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc. includes a clip of Behn describing herself as “a very radical person.”\n \n\n   \n  Opponents have also mined episodes of her podcast including one from 2020 where she talked about her dislike of country music and Nashville’s status as a popular tourist destination, as well as a video Behn recorded in May while monitoring immigration operations in her district in which she said she was “bullying the ICE vehicles and state troopers.” (Behn said her use of the word bullying was satire.)\n \n\n   \n  In her interview with CNN, Behn suggested Republicans have “been caught flat-footed, and they have resorted to personal attacks and character assassination.” Addressing the flurry of reports about her past comments in the final weeks of the campaign, Behn claimed they were “taken out of context and/or mischaracterized.”\n \n\n   \n  Behn added that she was not a lawmaker at the time she made many of the comments, and she’s since “matured” and shifted in the way she approaches politics now that she’s a state representative and not solely an activist.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve learned a lot, and I would hope that voters in the 7th District would give me the benefit of the doubt, that despite whatever … is being resurfaced right now, that I’m someone who has a track record of trying to unrig the system in favor of working people,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Tennessee Democrats told CNN they believe voters in the district will weigh other concerns when deciding on their vote in the election.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really all about the mess in Washington,” said Cooper, referring to the deciding factor of the race. “It’s a very important chance for Tennessee voters in one of the most beautiful parts of Tennessee to really speak loudly and clearly and say, ‘Hey, we’re upset, we need some help, and we’re looking for somebody who’s gonna help us.’”\n \n\n   \n  Behn’s campaign sees the millions that Republicans are pouring into the race as a sign of growing GOP concern. One campaign adviser pointed to a recent ad from Van Epps in which the Republican nominee does not mention the president, but leans into messaging about bringing down costs and making health care more affordable.\n \n\n   \n  “The type of content that you’re seeing from Matt Van Epps is what you’d expect to see from a Blue Dog Democrat in a district that Trump won by five points, not from a Republican in a district that Trump won by 22,” said Ian Russell.\n \n\n   \n  Even as Democrats outperform their 2024 margins in special elections this year, both parties see Van Epps as the favorite heading into Tuesday. “With strong conservative turnout, we will have a win next Tuesday, and I’ll hit the ground running, working with President Trump to lower the cost of living for hardworking Tennessee families,” Van Epps said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Republicans are bracing for a result that will be closer than the more than 20-point margins posted by Trump and Green a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Chip Saltsman, a Nashville-based Republican strategist not working with the Van Epps campaign, said that unlike Green, an incumbent and former state lawmaker who represented part of the district before the 2022 redistricting, Van Epps is a first-time candidate. He added that while he still expects Van Epps to win, Democrats had done a better job of quickly pivoting to the general election.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been so focused on the Republican primary, because that’s really the only game in town for most of the state,” Saltsman said. “Republicans got a little bit of a late start in reminding [voters] that there is actually a general election.”\n \n\n   \n  Scott Golden, the chair of the Tennessee Republican Party, said the party was working to get Van Epps’ message out there, but argued it may been getting lost in the news about Behn’s past comments.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not nervous that we’re going to lose, but we have to make sure that we work every single second,” Golden said.\n \n\n   \n    A focus on affordability\n \n\n   \n  Behn has made health care and grocery affordability a central part of her message, which she argues has been a common theme of her activism and political work.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m someone who hasn’t equivocated on affordability,” she said. “It has always been my ethos and my organizing agenda, legislative agenda, to make things more affordable for Tennesseans.\n \n\n   \n  Born and raised in Knoxville, Behn attended college in Austin and moved back to Tennessee during Trump’s first term in office. While the president and Republicans pursued their failed 2017 effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, she worked as a community health care organizer for the Tennessee Justice Center, a non-profit law firm based in Nashville.\n \n\n   \n  During her time as a national organizer for Indivisible, a progressive grassroots group, Behn took a leave of absence to help organize protests against the  expulsion of two Black lawmakers  who protested on the state House floor in favor of gun control. The experience, she said, inspired her to run in a September 2023 special election for a Nashville-area state legislature seat.\n \n\n   \n  She’s emphasized her efforts to  repeal the state’s four percent grocery tax , her work advocating against cuts to Medicaid and the cost-of-living issues she says Republicans in Washington have failed to address.\n \n\n   \n  “This race is competitive because the Washington Republican agenda has not delivered,” Behn said. “They have not addressed costs despite the commitment from the Trump administration to make groceries cheaper, utilities cheaper, rent cheaper … and I think people are looking for an opportunity to vote for someone who’s going to usher in an era of change.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/tech/ai-chips-google-gemini-3-tpu-nvidia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-05:00","title":"The hottest new AI company is…Google?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Google has surged in the AI race with the launch of its Gemini 3 model, which now leads benchmark scores in text generation, image editing, and processing, surpassing rivals like ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff  wrote on X  that he’s not going back to ChatGPT after trying Google’s new model. “The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Now Meta is said to be in talks with Google about buying its Tensor chips, according to  The Information , coming after  Anthropic said  in October that it plans to significantly expand its own use of Google’s technology.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of Google were up nearly 8% last week, while Nvidia’s were down a little over 2%.\n \n\n   \n  At stake is more than just bragging rights or a few sales contracts. As the tech industry claims AI will reshape the world — including investment portfolios belonging to everyone from billionaires to 401k-holding retirees — what company and what vision comes out on top could affect nearly every American.\n \n\n   \n  At face value, Nvidia’s post says the company isn’t worried about Google encroaching on its territory. And for good reason — Google’s chips are fundamentally different from Nvidia’s offerings, meaning they aren’t a match-for-match alternative.\n \n\n   \n  But that OpenAI and Nvidia felt the need to acknowledge Google at all is telling.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re in the lead for now, let’s call it, until somebody else comes up with the next model,” Angelo Zino, senior vice president and technology lead at CFRA, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Google and Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n    The leader for now\n \n\n   \n  Google is hardly an AI underdog. Along with ChatGPT, Gemini is one of the world’s most popular AI chatbots, and Google is one of the few cloud providers large enough to be known as a “hyperscaler,” a term for the handful of tech giants that rent out cloud-based computing resources to other companies on a large scale. Google services like Search and Translate have used AI as far back as the early 2000s.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Google was largely caught flat-footed by OpenAI’s ChatGPT when it arrived in 2022. Google management reportedly issued a “code red” in December 2022 following ChatGPT’s seemingly overnight success, according to  The New York Times . ChatGPT now has at least 800 million weekly active users, according to its maker, OpenAI, while Google’s Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users.\n \n\n   \n  But Gemini 3, which debuted on November 18, now sits at the top of  benchmark leaderboards  for tasks like text generation, image editing, image processing and turning text into images, putting it ahead of rivals like ChatGPT, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude in those categories.\n \n\n   \n  Google said over one million users tried Gemini 3 in its first 24 hours through both the company’s AI coding program and the tools that allow digital services to connect to other apps.\n \n\n   \n  But people tend to use different AI models for different purposes, says Ben Barringer, the global head of technology research at investment firm Quilter Cheviot. For example, models from xAI and Perplexity are ranked higher than Gemini 3 search performance in benchmark tests.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t necessarily mean (Google parent) Alphabet is going to be … the end-all when it comes to AI,” said Zino. “They’re just kind of another piece to this AI ecosystem that continues to get bigger.”\n \n\n   \n    More chip competition\n \n\n   \n  Google began making its Tensor chips long before the recent AI boom. But Nvidia still dominates in AI chips with the company reporting 62% year-over-year sales growth  in the October quarter  and profits up 65% compared to a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  That’s largely because Nvidia’s chips are powerful and can be used more broadly. Nvidia and its chief rival, AMD, specialize in chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, which can perform vast amounts of complex calculations quickly.\n \n\n   \n  Google’s Tensor chips are ASICs, or chips that are custom-made for specific purposes.\n \n\n   \n  While GPUs and Google’s chips can both be used for training and running AI models, ASICs are usually designed for “narrower workloads” than GPUs are designed for, Jacob Feldgoise, senior data research analyst at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the differences in the types of chips themselves, Nvidia provides full technology packages to be used in data centers that include not just GPUs, but other critical components like networking chips.\n \n\n   \n  It also offers a software platform that allows developers to tailor their code so that their apps can make better use of Nvidia’s chips, a key selling point for hooking in long-term customers. Even Google is an Nvidia client.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at the magnitude of Nvidia’s offerings, nobody really can touch them,” said Ted Mortonson, technology desk sector strategist at Baird.\n \n\n   \n  Chips like Google’s won’t replace Nvidia anytime soon. But increased adoption of ASICs, combined with more competition from AMD, could suggest companies are looking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.\n \n\n   \n  And Google won’t be the only AI chip competitor, said Barringer of Quilter Cheviot, and it’s doubtful it will achieve Nvidia’s dominance.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a part of a balance,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/uk/plastic-biobead-spill-england-uk-environmental-disaster-gbr-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"07:21:00-05:00","title":"An oil spill in solid form: Bio-bead disaster devastates beloved English coast","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive bio-bead spill occurred in southern England in early November 2025, when a mechanical failure at a Southern Water wastewater treatment plant released an estimated 10 tons (650 million) of plastic pellets into the sea.

beloved English coast \n       \n  By Kara Fox, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:21 AM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Andy Dinsdale began walking the southern English coast in search of a “sea heart,” a tough Mahogany seed carried by ocean currents from Central and South American rainforests.\n \n\n   \n  In his quest to find one, he inadvertently became a  plastic pollution  expert.\n \n\n   \n  For the last 20 years, Dinsdale has witnessed the transformation of Camber Sands, a 2-mile stretch of golden sand and dunes, from one of Britain’s most cherished stretches of coast into a front line of an escalating  environmental crisis .\n \n\n   \n  But he wasn’t prepared for what he saw in early November. As Dinsdale and citizen scientist group Strandliners scoured the beach for a pollution survey, they discovered something peculiar: An astonishing number of black plastic pellets were littering the sand.\n \n\n   \n  Millions of bio-beads — peppercorn-sized plastic pellets used in some wastewater plants to grow bacteria that help break down pollutants during the final step of the cleaning process — had washed into the English Channel after a mechanical failure days earlier at a water treatment plant more than 35 miles up the coast.\n \n\n   \n  An estimated 10 tons — or up to 650 million beads — had escaped into the sea, mingling into sand, slipping into creeks, and infiltrating the salt marshes of the adjacent Rye Harbour Nature Reserve, one of Britain’s most ecologically significant coastal wetlands. The spill represents one of the UK’s worst environmental disasters in years.\n \n\n   \n  After Strandliners and local lawmakers sounded the alarm, Southern Water, the private utility company that owns the plant, accepted responsibility for the October 29 incident, saying on November 10 it was “very sorry.”\n \n\n   \n  News of the spill sparked a mass volunteer effort, with up to a hundred people a day out on the beach, working with kitchen sieves, colanders and buckets in the initial days of the cleanup.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Water has since deployed clean-up crews to the site, working with local authorities and independent contractors. The company has promised to cover all costs associated with the clean-up, although some consumers are concerned the cost will ultimately be passed on to them through their utility bills.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Water said it believed 80% of the beads had been recovered from the beach as of November 11, but acknowledged that more beads would likely wash ashore with future high tides.\n \n\n   \n  “These bio-beads will be here forever,” Dinsdale said, walking up the shoreline on a bitterly cold but sun-drenched day.\n \n\n   \n  “The horrific thing for us is that they’re so small, so when people walk by them, they just think they’re bits of seaweed… or bits of stone or gravel.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Dumping grounds’\n \n\n   \n  Barbara Plum, who lives a few miles away, was sifting through a windswept patch of sand on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “Our beaches are just used as dumping grounds,” Plum said, explaining that she felt compelled to volunteer. She told CNN she hopes increased scrutiny will put pressure on corporations.\n \n\n   \n  “Companies probably need to be forced to make changes. You know that they probably choose the cheapest option, which may involve plastic use.”\n \n\n   \n  Environmentalists have advocated for replacing plastic bio-beads in wastewater treatment plants with plastic-free, natural alternatives such as sand and pumice. These options are porous, effective, and pose fewer long-term environmental threats if lost, unlike their plastic counterparts.\n \n\n   \n  Dinsdale said that an ideal world would be plastic-free but acknowledged that’s not realistic.\n \n\n   \n  “We use (plastic) in so many lifesaving situations, but used in the wrong place, it can be catastrophic to the environment. And in this example, with the wastewater treatment works, the environment was not on the list of the possibilities of what could happen with them.”\n \n\n   \n  Southern Water maintains that the beads are inert and non-toxic, citing their manufacturer. But experts and conservationists have raised doubts, pointing out the beads come from plants that were constructed in the 1990s, when post-consumer recycled plastic frequently contained heavy metals including lead, antimony and bromine, with persistent chemical residues. Southern Water told CNN it was looking into the age of the beads involved in the spill as part of its own independent investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers fear that bio-beads can leach toxins absorbed during wastewater processing, or pick up pollutants as they drift through the sea, such as PFAS — often called “forever chemicals” because they fail to break down fully in the environment. Once ingested by fish, birds, or seals, these chemicals can bio-accumulate and travel up the food chain, including to humans.\n \n\n   \n  Amy Youngman, a legal and policy specialist at the Environmental Investigation Agency, a UK-based NGO, called the incident “essentially an oil spill in solid form, but with added chemical toxicity.”\n \n\n   \n  “Wherever you end up with a pellet washed on your shore, you likely have some chemical contaminants along with them, or they enter the food web when animals eat them, and we eventually eat them as well,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Saunders came to Camber Sands from a town 20 miles away to join the clean-up Tuesday. It was his only day off work this week, he said, but he was driven by the birth of his new grandchild.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s my grandchild going to inherit? Nothing. Year upon year, it just gets worse. Environmental protection regulations are diminishing,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Southern Water, which provides water and wastewater services to millions of customers across a swath of southern England, uses bio-beads at five of its plants. The company told CNN that replacing bio-beads “is under consideration as part of the independent review we have commissioned into the incident,” and that upgrading aging systems requires investment and regulation. “These are complex decisions,” a  spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Approached for comment, regulator OFWAT referred CNN to the Environment Agency (EA), a government body.\n \n\n   \n  The EA told CNN that if bio-beads are lost and the environment is polluted, it will “investigate and take necessary enforcement action.” The EA added that it is working alongside the water sector on a project looking at “the impact of microplastics generated by wastewater treatment works.”\n \n\n   \n  That impact appears to be spreading beyond the UK.\n \n\n   \n  In late October, volunteers from the Surfrider Foundation Europe reported  finding black bio-beads on the northern French coast, between Cap Gris- Nez and Wissant.  Bio-beads have since begun appearing on shorelines in Belgium, too, according to the Belgian environment group Proper Strand Loper, affecting Oostende and De Haan.\n \n\n   \n  In England, the bio-bead spill is not an isolated incident.\n \n\n   \n  A steel mesh at a South West Water plant on the Truro River in Cornwall split in 2010, causing around 5.4 billion bio-beads to escape, leaving beaches and estuaries littered with pellets for years, according to a report from the environmental group Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition. In 2017, deposits of bio-beads were discovered along Dorset and Devon beaches, with surveys showing millions of tiny plastic pellets embedded in the sand, creeks, and estuaries. Those bio-beads also landed in Camber Sands.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘dinner plate’ for rare birds\n \n\n   \n  In Sussex, concern remains high over the threat the tiny beads pose to the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve, a vital saltmarsh and wildlife site, known for rare birds and home to more than 4,350 species of plants and animals, including 300 that are rare or endangered.\n \n\n   \n  Henri Brocklebank, director of conservation at the Sussex Wildlife Trust, a conservation charity, told CNN that the wetlands have been carefully managed to act as a “dinner plate” for the birds.\n \n\n   \n  “These (bio-beads) look just like little seeds. So it’s not really a huge leap of the imagination to think that these are going to be getting ingested by these rare birds that have migrated literally thousands and thousands of miles to be here,” she said, adding: “To have plastic here is completely contradictory to everything we’ve done to protect them.”\n \n\n   \n   Plastic  contributes to the deaths of up to 1 million seabirds each year, along with hundreds of thousands of marine mammals and turtles. A recent study by Ocean Conservancy, a US nonprofit, found that ingesting just three sugar-cube-sized pieces of plastic can be 90% fatal for seabirds like Atlantic puffins, with even tiny amounts threatening turtles and marine mammals.\n \n\n   \n  The latest bio-bead spill underscores a wider plastic problem along Europe’s coast — and the global crisis of plastic pollution.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, up to 23 million tons of plastic enters our aquatic ecosystems annually, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, which says it’s the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic being dumped into the world’s oceans, rivers, and lakes every day.\n \n\n   \n  At Camber Sands, the global crisis feels painfully local. Volunteers armed with sieves and combs continue their painstaking efforts to counter an industrial spill that could have far-reaching consequences.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t know how many are still out there. We don’t know what beaches they’re going to hit next,” Dinsdale said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/politics/house-republican-chaos-congress","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-04:00","title":"GOP Faces a House in Chaos","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives is in crisis as Republican leadership, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, struggles to maintain control amid escalating infighting, resignations, and political violence.

But that’s not the end of it: Members of both parties are increasingly feeling emboldened to buck party leadership,  forcing votes on personal priorities , including a spate of recent votes to punish fellow lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like us to get back to normal Congress,” Johnson said recently as he left the Capitol for Thanksgiving, acknowledging  the censure wars  that have roiled the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s the shocking resignation of one of President Donald Trump and Johnson’s most vocal critics in recent months,  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  — who is making clear she won’t be quiet on her way out in January.\n \n\n   \n  Even floor speeches are devolving into disparaging spats. In the House’s final vote before Thanksgiving, an ugly dispute between Reps. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, and Maria Salazar, a Florida Republican, over an anti-socialism measure required leadership intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we just gotta quit electing knuckleheads. We have a very high knucklehead percentage compared to non-knuckleheads up here,” Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee said when asked about the recent rise in tensions on the floor. “By and large, we just need to start electing better people.”\n \n\n   \n  That political pettiness has led to a notable uptick in frustrations within the House, at a time when GOP leaders are already facing an extraordinarily tough stretch that will include votes on contentious  Obamacare  and government funding measures loathed by the right wing. And the clash of emotions, diminishing legislative productivity and a rise in political violence outside of the Capitol grounds has led to an outpouring of concerns about what Congress can accomplish for the rest of the year and even up until the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “As I told my family last night, the House has just had a nervous breakdown. I don’t know what kind of drug we need. But it’s time for somebody to give us a prescription,” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat, told CNN, reflecting on the increasingly grim mood inside the House in its first full week in session after nearly two months.\n \n\n   \n  “Members are talking about it amongst ourselves; what’s going on with this place?” Cleaver told CNN. (Cleaver, a Methodist pastor, has arranged for more security while he’s home this week.)\n \n\n   \n  Inside the Capitol, lawmakers in both parties say the increasing nastiness among members has sunk morale to a new low. Already, 18 House Republicans are ditching their jobs to run for a  different political office , along with eight more on the Democratic side, in part because of current gridlock — and more retirement announcements are expected around the holidays.\n \n\n   \n  While the House was gone for 54 days during this fall’s historic government shutdown, it only took a week for drama to overtake the lower chamber. In just five days, lawmakers brought forward four resolutions to punish various colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “After not being in session for so long, one week has got everyone ready to go home,” Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The tensions go beyond Capitol Hill: Trump has weighed in with primary threats to members of his own party and even  seemingly suggested  that a group of Democrats who spoke out against his policies should be put to death.\n \n\n   \n  That infighting has led — most recently — to the surprise announcement by Greene that she would resign her seat in the new year after her public feud with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s planned departure complicates things for Johnson, and not just because she will further narrow his slim majority during what could be the last major burst of policymaking in Trump’s second term. The Georgia firebrand also publicly called out the GOP for essentially surrendering their House majority, further inflaming tensions in her own party.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans across the board are increasingly worried about their fate next November. The party is on edge that Trump’s redistricting push may be backfiring, awaiting a critical  ruling on its Texas maps  as soon as this week. Then there’s the early December special election in Tennessee, which Republicans are heavily favored to win but likely with a closer-than-expected margin with Democrats now spending heavily in the race.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson will quickly feel Greene’s absence.\n \n\n   \n  After the Epstein push, more lawmakers of both parties are now eager to force their own votes using the discharge petition, which was once rarely successful but is now increasingly part of members’ strategy to work around Johnson. It’s a rare step for lawmakers to take when their own party is in power.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who has shown she’s unafraid to tangle with Johnson, is now pushing a politically popular bill to ban lawmaker stock trading that still lacks support from leadership. Johnson may not be able to dodge floor votes the way a speaker normally can on politically thorny issues.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has suggested he wants to look at ways to make it more difficult for lawmakers to go rogue with their own legislative priorities, such as raising the threshold for discharge petitions. But he lacks the support in the wider GOP conference to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a bipartisan group of members are pushing a rule change that would make it harder for the House to engage in censures.\n \n\n   \n  “Today’s censure effect is less than it used to be. It used to be embarrassing,” Rep. Nick LaLota of New York told CNN. “I think the House would be right to move to increase the standard for censure. I think we should remove the privileged nature of it.”\n \n\n   \n  “Otherwise,” he warned, “these things will just continue to devolve into partisan attacks.”\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Steny Hoyer, the former No. 2 House Democrat, told CNN that he, too, sees “merit” in the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “This going tit-for-tat stuff is wrong,” Hoyer, who dealt with plenty of his own floor drama during his time as majority leader, told CNN. “You do not want to cheapen sanctions for behavior,” he warned, adding that the House needs to “preserve, to the extent we can, the image and integrity of the institution.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another grim reality facing Washington: A frightening uptick in political violence that Greene said contributed to her decision to leave — and prompted at least  one other prominent lawmaker  to head for the exits this year.\n \n\n   \n  Days before Greene announced her early retirement, Trump suggested that Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders should be put to death. All six of the Democrats featured in the video experienced a significant uptick in threats against them, including bomb threats, following Trump’s amplification.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump’s comments, one House Republican made a private plea to their colleagues that they had a role to play in turning down the rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  “We have got to tone it down,” the GOP lawmaker granted anonymity to discuss their private conversations told CNN. “Our colleagues have to do a better job of not being so personal. You got to be willing to work with people even if you don’t agree on stuff. You have got to build relationships and get to know them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/asia/visual-timeline-hong-kong-fire-intl-hnk-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"05:25:00-04:00","title":"A visual timeline of the few hours it took a small fire to grow into Hong Kong’s worst blaze in decades","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small fire that began on the first floor of an apartment building in a Hong Kong public housing estate rapidly escalated into a devastating inferno that consumed seven high-rise towers within hours.

It was a horror.”\n \n\n   \n  The neighborhood surrounding Prince Street in SoHo was a far cry from what it is today – a fashionable hub of high-end art galleries, posh boutiques and trendy restaurants. Back then, its largely vacant, cast-iron industrial buildings were starting to attract young artists. Rusting hulks of stolen cars littered narrow, cobblestone streets. Boarded-up storefronts and trash fires were common.\n \n\n   \n  Etan went missing in SoHo on the morning of May 25, 1979. It was the first time the first grader’s mother let him walk by himself to a bus stop roughly a block away. His body was never found. The disappearance riveted the city and the nation. It was the beginning of an era in which young boys and girls would be supervised like never before and cases of missing children gained national prominence.\n \n\n   \n  “It really hit the neighborhood hard. We were all very close at that point. I was sitting on the stoop the day before it happened. I had my arm around him,” Meisel said of Etan. “It was just very sad. And I don’t think anybody’s ever going to get answers.”\n \n\n   \n  That search for answers continues.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Manhattan prosecutors said they will  put a man on trial for a third time  after his conviction in the missing child case was overturned in July.\n \n\n   \n  “After thorough review, the district attorney has determined that the available, admissible evidence supports prosecuting (the) defendant on the charges of murder in the second degree and kidnapping in the first degree,” Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Sarah Marquez wrote in a letter to a New York State Supreme Court justice.\n \n\n   \n  A conference in the case against Pedro Hernandez, 64, who was  convicted during his second trial in 2017  of murdering and kidnapping Etan, was scheduled for Monday. He worked at a bodega near Etan’s home when the boy disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  A federal appeals court in July overturned his conviction, ruling that a trial judge was “clearly wrong” in a response to a 2017 jury question about Hernandez’s confessions, Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply disappointed in the decision … to retry Pedro Hernandez for a third time,” said defense attorney Harvey Fishbein in a statement, adding  his client “is innocent of the charges.”\n \n\n   \n  “But if this 46-year-old case is actually retried, we will be ready,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Etan’s parents, who moved to Honolulu in 2019, declined to comment to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “People would love to see the family finally get – I don’t think closure – but some sense of resolution,” Lisa R. Cohen, the author of “After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive,” told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “And I think they thought they got that in 2017 and now it’s back.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Start a whole ‘nother era of this case’\n \n\n   \n   Hernandez was arrested  in the case in 2012, more than three decades after Etan vanished. He  confessed to detectives  but his lawyer maintained the defendant under pressure made up his account of the crime. His attorney has said Hernandez is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to tell whether he committed the crime or not.\n \n\n   \n  Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Etan into a basement with the promise of a soda as the boy was on his way to school, according to prosecutors. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag.\n \n\n   \n  The former bodega clerk has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an “IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,”  his attorney Fishbein has said . Hernandez was questioned by police for more than seven hours and confessed before his Miranda rights were read to him.\n \n\n   \n  After his first trial in 2015 ended in a hung jury, Hernandez was convicted and sentenced in 2017 to  25 years to life in prison. \n \n\n   \n  “Now I know what the face of evil looks like and he’s finally convicted,” Stanley Patz said at a news conference at the time. Patz and his wife thought they would never find out what happened to their child, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years the Patz family worked to keep the case alive and create awareness of missing children in the United States. The anniversary of Etan’s disappearance, May 25, is remembered as National Missing Children’s Day.\n \n\n   \n  Etan’s was the first of several high-profile cases that pushed concern about missing children to the forefront of national consciousness. Photos of Etan and other missing children were later featured on milk cartons.\n \n\n   \n  In another case, in 1981, 6-year-old Adam Walsh was abducted from a Florida shopping mall and killed.\n \n\n   \n  In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children’s Assistance Act, which helped lead to the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n \n\n   \n  Cohen said Etan’s disappearance dramatically changed the way Americans watched over their children.\n \n\n   \n  “Before Etan, there was a different way that parents saw the issues of child safety and raised their kids,” she said. “Kids played in the street, kids came home when it got dark. There wasn’t this incredible tracking. After Etan, not necessarily the minute it happened, but little by little, this movement was sparked where parents then became much more concerned.”\n \n\n   \n  Stanley Patz was a professional photographer and Etan was frequently the sit-in for lighting in the apartment that also served as a photo studio, Cohen said. The images of Etan’s smiling, cherubic face were widely distributed during the yearslong search for the blond, blue-eyed boy.\n \n\n   \n  “His father immediately ran and got these contact sheets that he had of these pictures that he had taken of Etan and started making copies,” she said. “The community was immediately putting them up on posters. I think the pictures are a huge part of this … It speaks to the power of his visual image.”\n \n\n   \n  Under federal court rulings, AP reported, jury selection for Hernandez’s retrial must begin by June 1, or he must be released from prison.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s not like this incredible resolution,” Cohen said. “Certainly not now, because they’re now going to start a whole ‘nother era of this case.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/europe/zelensky-yermak-right-hand-man-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"12:58:00-05:00","title":"Zelensky dismissed his right-hand man.

dismissed his right-hand man. Is he weaker or stronger now? \n       \n  Analysis by Andrew Carey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:58 AM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Since before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, he was rarely far from Volodymyr Zelensky’s side, whether welcoming foreign dignitaries to Kyiv, or accompanying the Ukrainian president abroad on crucial missions to secure military and diplomatic support.\n \n\n   \n  Now,  Andriy Yermak’s resignation  could become Zelensky’s biggest political test since taking office six-and-a-half years ago. While the departure will likely play well at home, it casts uncertainty into the heart of the administration at a critical diplomatic moment.\n \n\n   \n  Yermak, the former head of the president’s office, quit on Friday after anti-corruption officers raided his home – apparently the latest and highest-profile casualty of Ukraine’s spiraling scandal over alleged kickbacks in the energy sector.\n \n\n   \n  The upset comes as Ukraine faces mounting US pressure to sign a peace agreement  widely seen as favoring Russia . Just days earlier, Yermak had been in Geneva, leading Ukraine’s team as they met with a US delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss the latest White House plan.\n \n\n   \n  As he announced the dismissal, Zelensky said he was grateful to Yermak for “always representing Ukraine’s position in negotiations in exactly the right way.”\n \n\n   \n  “It has always been a patriotic position,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Among Ukrainians, Yermak’s downfall will likely find considerable approval.\n \n\n   \n  Yermak had become a deeply unpopular figure who “somehow aggregated all the dissatisfaction with what the president does wrong,” Nataliya Gumenyuk, a member of the board of independent news media organization Hromadske, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A series of corruption scandals in recent years, a bust-up with his former, and highly popular, army chief, and the messy introduction of new mobilisation policies have all threatened to tarnish Zelensky’s image. But while his approval ratings are a way down from 2022 levels, they have held fairly steady over the last couple of years.\n \n\n   \n  Another journalist, Olga Rudenko of the Kyiv Independent, said Yermak’s departure was proof of the strength of Ukrainian democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “Think about it: A young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country – and to do so during the war,” she wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  A key question will be whether his departure increases the domestic pressure on Zelensky himself, or in fact turns the tide.\n \n\n   \n  Gumenyuk said she believed Ukrainians would accept Zelensky’s framing of the loss of his right-hand man as a positive reset of his administration. And the president will have been heartened that MPs from his own party – some of whom had threatened to leave the party if Yermak remained in post – issued a statement praising him for putting the interests of the country first.\n \n\n   \n  But a former government official told CNN the decision had come too late, arguing many Ukrainians would now be asking what Zelensky knew about Yermak’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “On the one side, you have his close ally, on the other side, you have his close friend, his former business partner,” the official said, referring to both Yermak and another man caught up in the latest scandal, Timur Mindich. “Do you really think the president wasn’t aware about this?”\n \n\n   \n  Yermak’s widespread unpopularity was a function of his immense power as an electorally unaccountable head of the Presidential Office.\n \n\n   \n  “He was a shadow prime minister,” Orysia Lutsevych of London-based think tank Chatham House said, describing a man who effectively chose who would serve in Zelensky’s government.\n \n\n   \n  But Yermak was also fiercely loyal to his boss.\n \n\n   \n  “There (was) a lot of co-dependency, they spent a lot of time together … Yermak positioned himself as a negotiator, as somebody who not only kind of runs the regular daily activities, but can solve problems,” Lutsevych said. “He’s a deal maker.”\n \n\n   \n  Of his chief adviser, Zelensky himself  said  last year: “I respect him for his results. He does what I tell him.”\n \n\n   \n  For sure, it seems hard to believe that Ukraine’s leader will easily find a replacement in whom he can place as much trust and responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s before he weighs up the prosecution of the war and the international situation.\n \n\n   \n  Yermak had been expected to go to the US this weekend to lead Ukraine’s delegation in another round of talks with the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear who will take his place as team leader, though Ukraine certainly has plenty of senior officials with experience of these highly difficult negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  And even though he played such a prominent role in Zelensky’s diplomatic endeavors, Yermak’s reputation abroad was not what it once was. Becoming embroiled in a major corruption scandal only further weakened his standing, particularly in the United States, where even the whiff of misappropriated funds has always proved a major stumbling block for many of Ukraine’s supporters in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  One European diplomat based in Kyiv told CNN that Zelensky “had little choice but to fire Yermak in view of the damaging headlines carried by global media.”\n \n\n   \n  But it is perhaps the optics of chaos at the heart of power in Kyiv that will prove most damaging.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, unsurprisingly, has seized on an opportunity to try to undermine Zelensky’s legitimacy.\n \n\n   \n  “(The) political uncertainty that is caused by this scandal is growing and growing very fast, day by day. One can hardly now make a prognosis on what is going to happen next,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN’s Matthew Chance.\n \n\n   \n  Pulling all the threads together, Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister and a key international ally of Ukraine, saw things bleakly.\n \n\n   \n  He drew attention to the fact Yermak’s dismissal took place on the same day as  a visit by Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Moscow , and in the midst of what he called the “chaos in negotiations” with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “A fatal combination,” he posted on X.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/29/politics/dc-business-community-shock-national-guard-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Bustling DC retail district in shock after shooting of National Guard members","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A lone gunman fatally shot Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old National Guard member from West Virginia, and injured fellow guard Andrew Wolfe outside the Farragut West Metro Station in Washington, DC, on November 29, 2025.

  \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fasil Regassa wipes away tears when he talks about  Sarah Beckstrom , the 20-year-old National Guard member who was shot Wednesday just a few feet away from his store.\n \n\n   \n  “I cried when I heard she died,” Regassa told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For nine years, Regassa and his wife, immigrants from Ethiopia, have managed a 7-Eleven convenience store just across the street from  the shooting scene . When the shooting started, Regassa said, he locked the front doors of his store and rushed the three or four customers inside to a back area for safety.\n \n\n   \n  In the bustling downtown area   of Washington, DC, blocks away from the White House and packed with tourists, chain restaurants, cafes, banks, stores and corporate offices, business community members   are still processing the violence and chaos they experienced near the Farragut West Metro Station.\n \n\n   \n  Beckstrom and fellow guard member Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot multiple times by a lone gunman just outside the entrance to the metro station. Beckstrom died from her injuries Thursday evening. Both soldiers, members of the West Virginia National Guard, had been deployed to the nation’s capital during President Donald Trump’s law enforcement surge in August of this year.\n \n\n   \n  Regassa said the presence of National Guard members in this district has made the area “more safe” and described the Guard members who have come into his store for snacks and drinks as “completely nice people.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he appreciates the guard members and feels the retail area was a more dangerous place before their arrival. He told CNN of an incident in 2020 when he says five assailants overran his store, stole some goods and caused him to suffer a broken leg when one of them crashed down on him as he lay on the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Rosa Fuentes was also caught up in the chaos of Wednesday afternoon. Fuentes manages the Tatte Bakery & Cafe, less than a block from the shooting scene. When she heard the shots, Fuentes said, she immediately closed and locked the doors of the restaurant and kept customers inside.\n \n\n   \n  She saw one woman outside running, who she described as crying, “shaking” and “panicking,” and she opened the doors to let her in. “We were scared,” Fuentes said, because “we didn’t know if they had got the guy.”\n \n\n   \n  Fuentes, who has a 23-year-old daughter, also fought back tears when she reflected on Beckstrom’s death. She said she was crying when she heard the news, “and was thinking about how her parents felt.”\n \n\n   \n  Fuentes, an immigrant from El Salvador, described the guardsmen who come into her restaurant as nice people, but she has mixed feelings about the Trump administration’s plans to deploy additional guard soldiers to Washington in the wake of the shooting. She initially said she thought it could make the area safer, but added, “I don’t know,” saying that she’s worried about what could happen to the guard members themselves.\n \n\n   \n  The manager of another cafe nearby, who declined to provide her name or the name of the establishment, said she witnessed the shooting, describing it as “shocking.” She recalled locking the doors of the cafe and getting customers down on the ground in the moments afterward. She said the guardsmen patrolling the area since August have kept a “low profile,” and she is pleased that more of them could be deployed here soon. They’d provide “another layer of protection,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Gyanu Sapkota, an immigrant from Nepal who has managed a Subway sandwich shop near Farragut Square for 18 years, told CNN that guard members would often come into his shop during their deployment, and he said Beckstrom and Wolfe looked familiar to him.\n \n\n   \n  The guard members in the city “are very, very nice,” said Sapkota, who was not at the store during the shooting. “Most were very friendly. Most of them were very young.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the arrival of the guard members in the tourist-heavy area, Sapkota said he often had problems with people coming into his store and stealing drinks and bags of chips. But he said the presence of the National Guard in the area has made him and his employees feel safer, and he applauded the plan to send more guard troops to DC. “That’s better for us,” Sapkota said.\n \n\n   \n  Managers of local branches of major banks that operate in Farragut Square, who declined to give their names, described to CNN locking doors and taking cover after the shooting, seeing police converging on the scene and people running past their windows.\n \n\n   \n  While one of the managers described the shooting as “sad,” he said of the presence of the guard members in the area, “I didn’t want them here.”\n \n\n   \n  “In my opinion, they’re military folks, and they’re always going to be targeted,” he said. “I just feel there’s ways you can do more in the community to cut violence. I don’t think the National Guard would do that.”\n \n\n   \n  The manager of another bank described the guard members in the area as friendly, and he said one of them gave him a patch as a kind gesture.  But he added, of the possible deployment of additional guard members here, “I don’t think they should bring more of them here. I don’t think it’ll help the situation.”\n \n\n   \n    Makeshift memorial draws emotional reflections\n \n\n   \n  On Friday,   a makeshift memorial to the victims at the site of the shooting grew by the hour, with people placing flowers, wreaths, flags and notes in an outdoor planter by the entrance to the Farragut West station.\n \n\n   \n  A 21-year-old Marine, who did not give his name because he’s not authorized to speak to the media, placed a vase of roses, an American flag patch and two challenge coins at the memorial.\n \n\n   \n  After taking a moment to reflect on the victims, he told CNN he thought the political rhetoric and finger-pointing following the shooting has been “disgusting.”\n \n\n   \n  “It all needs to stop,” he said. “We need to recognize that a US service member has lost their life.”\n \n\n   \n  A note was placed that read: “Praying for all Nat’l Guard — thank you for all you do.”\n \n\n   \n  A man who laid flowers said, while he didn’t agree with the National Guard’s deployment in the city, “she didn’t deserve to die.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/trump-honduran-president-juan-orlando-hernandez-pardon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he will pardon former Honduran president serving sentence in drug-trafficking case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced a full and complete pardon for former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is serving a 45-year federal prison sentence and a $8 million fine for drug trafficking charges linked to his time in office.

\n   \n  President Donald Trump said Friday he intends to grant a “full and complete pardon” to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, a move that would erase a major US drug-trafficking conviction for a onetime US ally who is currently serving a  45-year federal prison sentence .\n \n\n   \n  “I will be granting a Full and Complete Pardon to Former President Juan Orlando Hernandez who has been, according to many people that I greatly respect, treated very harshly and unfairly,” Trump  announced  on his Truth Social platform.\n \n\n   \n  “This cannot be allowed to happen, especially now, after Tito Asfura wins the Election, when Honduras will be on its way to Great Political and Financial Success. VOTE FOR TITO ASFURA FOR PRESIDENT, AND CONGRATULATIONS TO JUAN ORLANDO HERNANDEZ ON YOUR UPCOMING PARDON.”\n \n\n   \n  President of Honduras from 2014 until 2022, Hernández was sentenced last year and given an $8 million fine by a US judge for  drug trafficking offenses .\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors had accused Hernández of conspiring with drug cartels during his tenure as they moved more than 400 tons of cocaine through Honduras toward the United States. In exchange, prosecutors said, Hernández received millions of dollars in bribes that he used to fuel his rise in Honduran politics.\n \n\n   \n  During his years in office, the Justice Department said, Hernández “protected and enriched the drug traffickers in his inner circle.” Prosecutors cited his use of executive power to support extraditions to the US of certain drug traffickers “who threatened his grip on power,” while “promising drug traffickers who paid him and followed his instructions that they would remain in Honduras.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s announcement comes as his administration has focused in recent months on what it has said is a counter-drug operation in the Caribbean, with  US military activity  ramping up there.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s regime has been responding to the increase with its own  show of force  in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecution of Hernández mirrored the US government’s allegations against Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Hernández was accused, and convicted, of aiding drug trafficking cartels that are responsible for bringing deadly drugs to the US. By contrast, US drug enforcement authorities say that many of the drug trafficking routes the Maduro regime enables are aimed at European illicit markets.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has been facing formal drug trafficking charges from the Justice Department since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Hernández, who denied the charges against him, had been extradited from Honduras after the US Department of Justice filed three drug-trafficking and firearms-related charges against him in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Following the announcement, Hernández’s attorney thanked Trump and said “we look forward to President Hernandez’s triumphant return to Honduras.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are so grateful to President Trump and everyone who supported President Hernandez.

Street is relying on the Supreme Court to protect the Fed. Is that wishful thinking? \n       \n  Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Sat November 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Wall Street barely blinked at President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve this year. But its confidence could be shaken with an upcoming Supreme Court ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has launched an intense pressure campaign against the Fed during his second term, frequently demanding interest-rate cuts and threatening to fire Chair Jerome Powell. The central bank has lowered interest rates twice this year, in September and October, and has another opportunity to cut rates in December.\n \n\n   \n  Yet investors remain confident in the Fed’s ability to fight inflation — at least according to measures such as long-term interest rates on US Treasuries and inflation expectations.\n \n\n   \n  Their faith hinges on a Supreme Court case over  Trump’s efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook , a Biden appointee and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump wins, the Fed’s vaunted independence to set interest rates without political interference could crumble.\n \n\n   \n  But Wall Street seems to believe the Supreme Court will ultimately opt to keep the central bank independent. Markets also seem to believe that none of the names floated to succeed Powell as Fed chair when his term ends in May pose a threat in that regard, either.\n \n\n   \n  “For now, Wall Street is very comfortable with Fed independence,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at financial services firm DA Davidson.\n \n\n   \n    Signs that investors have mostly been unfazed\n \n\n   \n  Just three days after Trump said he fired Cook in August — the first time a president has tried to fire a Fed governor in the central bank’s near-112-year history — the S&P 500 closed at a record high as other major stock indexes pushed higher.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a benchmark used for the rates on various loans, has steadily declined since the spring, when Trump began to threaten firing Powell. That means investors don’t see interest rates getting out of control in the next decade, a sign of confidence in the Fed.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, long-term market-based inflation expectations, which capture Wall Street’s faith in the Fed’s ability to fight price increases, have remained in check throughout the year.\n \n\n   \n  But fears of growing government deficits have driven up so-called term premiums, the extra yield investors demand for holding long-term bonds over shorter ones. Investors say concerns about Fed independence have also played a role — albeit a minor one — in the uptick.\n \n\n   \n    Two decisive moments for the Fed\n \n\n   \n  The court has scheduled oral arguments in late January to determine whether Trump has the power to fire Cook. The president has cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The Justice Department is investigating, but she has not been charged. Earlier this month, Cook’s lawyers said the allegations are “baseless” and  urged the department to drop its inquiry. \n \n\n   \n  In a separate case in May, the justices said in an unsigned opinion that Trump  could keep Gwynne Wilcox , whom he fired from the National Labor Relations Board, off the NLRB while she continues fighting in court to reverse her termination.\n \n\n   \n  But SCOTUS specifically said that  decision doesn’t impact the Fed .\n \n\n   \n  “Markets took a great deal of comfort from that,” Randall Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said at a central banking conference on October 31 hosted by the Peterson Institute for Economics (PIIE). He said investors “believe that the Supreme Court will take a reasonable and balanced approach” in the Cook case.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are also closely watching Trump’s nomination of the next Fed chair. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led the search, revealed  a shortlist of five people  from the White House, the Fed and the private sector. The list includes National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as well as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent told CNBC recently that Trump’s announcement could come around Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets still seem to be fairly confident Fed independence will prevail, and I think this is in part because of the names that we saw for Fed chairman were reasonable,” Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor and monetary policy scholar at Johns Hopkins University, said at the PIIE conference.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/afghan-vetting-process-scrutiny","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"20:14:00-05:00","title":"Afghan vetting process under renewed scrutiny following National Guard shooting in DC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A shooting incident in Washington, DC involving a 29-year-old Afghan man, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has reignited scrutiny of the US vetting process for Afghans resettled after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.

      8:14 PM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump  is blaming  the Biden administration for this week’s  shooting  of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, in part by insisting that the suspect, a 29-year-old Afghan, was among millions of foreigners Biden allowed into the US without proper vetting.\n \n\n   \n  Details about the alleged shooter’s background, including his previous work for the CIA in Afghanistan, and conversations with sources familiar with the vetting process, paint a far more complicated picture.\n \n\n   \n  While investigators have yet to establish a clear motive for the shooting, the incident is likely to rekindle concerns over the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the haste with which thousands of evacuees were brought to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Trump officials have suggested a breakdown in vetting is likely tied to the attack, while the president is already using it as a reason to  further his crack down  on immigrants in the US, including reevaluating the green card status of foreign nationals from a variety of countries.\n \n\n   \n  In a video address from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida late Wednesday, Trump argued the attack carried out by a lone gunman “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  “We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was among more than 190,000 Afghans admitted into the US following its withdrawal from Afghanistan, under programs designed to resettle those who helped the US during its 20-year war in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Over the course of more than a decade, sources told CNN, Lakanwal underwent numerous rounds of vetting — starting around 2011 by the CIA when he began working with the US military and intelligence agencies — and ending earlier this year when he was approved for permanent asylum in the US by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Lakanwal was part of a prioritized group evacuated from Kabul after the Afghan capital fell to the Taliban. Due to his work for the US, including serving in an elite Afghan counterterrorism unit, Lakanwal was considered to be at risk of retribution once the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  Once evacuated, Lakanwal went through what sources told CNN were multiple layers of vetting by multiple US government agencies — first in a Middle Eastern country, according to one source familiar with the matter — and then regularly over the past few years while he was residing in the US.\n \n\n   \n  In April, Lakanwal, who lived in Washington state, was granted permanent asylum by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  In June, the Justice Department  released  the results of an audit into the FBI’s role in facilitating screening Afghans brought to the US after the 2021 withdrawal. The audit, conducted by the department’s Inspector General, found no systemic breakdowns in the multi-layered process, involving various federal agencies, that was established at the time to screen and vet Afghan evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  The report does acknowledge, however, that “the normal processes required to determine whether individuals posed a threat to national security and public safety were overtaken by the need to immediately evacuate and protect the lives of Afghans, increasing the potential that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation.”\n \n\n   \n  Concerns about the thoroughness of vetting for people admitted into the US after the Afghanistan withdrawal have caused angst in US security agencies for years.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023 and 2024, intelligence obtained from allies prompted the FBI to raise concerns about the thoroughness of vetting for Afghan and Central Asian asylum seekers, current and former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Rampant use of fraudulent identification documents and the use of fixers with ties to terrorist groups were a primary concern.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI sent agents to investigate the backgrounds of dozens of people who had been admitted to the US, and the reinvestigations prompted some removals, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, others disagree the vetting process is to blame for the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t think this is a vetting issue,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, a non-profit group involved in helping resettle thousands of Afghans after the US withdrawal in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Talking to CNN’s Becky Anderson Friday, VanDiver ticked through the extensive amount of screening Afghans like Lackanwal went through — including leading up to him attaining asylum this year.\n \n\n   \n  “People that came on the planes in August of 2021, they were vetted before they left. They were vetted when they went to a third country to continue their processing. They were vetted by (Customs and Border Patrol) and USCIS before they arrived here. While they were here, and awaiting adjustments of status, they were continuously vetted,” VanDiver said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is one man who, as the president said, ‘went cuckoo’ and took a deranged action that is not broadly indicative of the Afghan community at all,” VanDiver added.\n \n\n   \n  A Trump administration official pushed back on the notion that there was any semblance of normal protocol in place during this time.\n \n\n   \n  “The government was in shambles and in the process of being taken over by the Taliban. Our understanding, and what we’ve seen documented, is that there was very little vetting going on,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    Multiple layers of vetting\n \n\n   \n  The first round of vetting that Lakanwal received around 2011 by the CIA focused on determining whether he could safely work with US intelligence and military personnel in Afghanistan, according to a senior US official.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the CIA would have done its own vetting of Lakanwal through a variety of databases, including the National Counterterrorism Center database, to see if he had any known ties to terrorist groups, the senior official said.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal was vetted again a decade later by the NCTC during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, before he was allowed entry into the US.\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of vetting, nothing came up,” the senior US official told CNN, noting the review did not show any ties to terror organizations. “He was clean on all checks.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior official noted that the US government had been doing continuous, annual vetting of individuals since the Afghans’ arrival in the US, especially in the wake of the  failed terror plot  disrupted before the election last year in Oklahoma which involved an Afghan evacuee.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s NCTC Director Joe Kent confirmed in a tweet Friday that Lakanwal was previously vetted by the US intelligence community while he was still overseas, but noted that screening was focused on his ability to serve alongside American forces in Afghanistan — not whether he was fit to become a permanent US resident.\n \n\n   \n  “It is true that the terrorist who conducted the attack in D.C. was ‘vetted’ by the intelligence community, however he was only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen,” Kent said in the post.\n \n\n   \n  Kent also accused the Biden administration of using that same standard for allowing individuals entry into the US during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, “foregoing previous vetting standards applied to Special Immigrant Visas and any common sense vetting or concern for Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a result, over 85k Afghans—including individuals with backgrounds similar to this shooter— were rapidly admitted into our country without the rigorous vetting that has protected us in the past,” he claimed.\n \n\n   \n    A chaotic withdrawal\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, the Biden administration was under immense pressure from veterans groups to evacuate Afghans who had worked with American soldiers, some taking it upon themselves to help get people out of the country. The sense of urgency during that chaotic withdrawal raised bipartisan concerns about the screening process for Afghans who were ultimately admitted into the US.\n \n\n   \n  That was due in part to the sheer volume of Afghans who were coming to the US and the urgency of the evacuation itself, which came as the US-backed government in Kabul was collapsing.\n \n\n   \n  All of those factors contributed to concerns about the ability to accurately verify the identify of those being let into the US and vet them accordingly.\n \n\n   \n  That process is now under intense scrutiny as Trump calls for a reexamination of every person from Afghanistan who came to the US under President Joe Biden, and criticizes what he says were millions of “unknown and unvetted foreigners” admitted to the country under his predecessor.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the administration announced it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern” at Trump’s direction.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” Joe Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, wrote in a  post on X  Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for additional details, including which countries are considered to be “of concern,” USCIS pointed CNN to 19 countries listed in a  June presidential proclamation .\n \n\n   \n  The 19 countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said Thursday the administration is also reviewing all asylum cases that were approved under former President Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  “Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN, adding, “The Trump Administration is also reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/trump-biden-auto-pen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"16:34:00-05:00","title":"Trump pushes long-running attack on Biden autopen use, claiming he’s ‘cancelling’ actions signed with it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has escalated his political attack on former President Joe Biden by claiming that all executive actions signed using the autopen—approximately 92% of Biden’s documents—are null and void, asserting that Biden was not involved in the signing process and that those who used the autopen did so illegally.

Chief among them, whether he has the legal authority to rescind the former president’s actions on the basis he described.\n \n\n   \n  “Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92% of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect,” Trump wrote, without specifying what falls under that 92%.\n \n\n   \n  “The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump further claimed that Biden “was not involved in the Autopen process” and warned that “if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him. I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally. Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in his post.\n \n\n   \n  Biden has publicly disputed that there was any “cover-up” by his administration, saying he made all decisions as president and calling Republicans who have suggested otherwise “liars.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has  long fixated  on Biden’s use of the autopen. In March, he leaned into the idea that the former president’s use of the tool to sign documents showed that he wasn’t in charge while in the White House and that his actions were “null and void.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, conservative executive authority scholar John Yoo  suggested to CNN  that Trump was “just having fun at Biden’s expense.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump later ordered an investigation into Biden’s use of the autopen and its supposed links to the former president’s “cognitive decline.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2005, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (under Republican President George W. Bush) conducted an extensive review of the legality of a president using the autopen. It found that “the President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill to sign it within the meaning of Article I, Section 7.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has most often focused his autopen theory on Biden’s pardons. But there too, established legal advice from past administrations undermines the claim. A 1929 memo from the US solicitor general noted that the Constitution didn’t even prescribe a method for issuing pardons.\n \n\n   \n  A separate congressional probe asserted it  remained a serious question  as to whether Biden was aware of the substance of various pardons and commutations signed in his name via autopen, but it did not cite any direct evidence that anyone other than Biden made the decisions that his staff later put into effect.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/trump-immigration-crackdown-national-guard-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"19:43:00Z","title":"An emboldened Trump escalates his anti-immigration crackdown after National Guard shooting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a shooting that killed two National Guard members in Washington, DC, President Donald Trump intensified his anti-immigration agenda, launching a federal investigation into the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the U.S. under the Biden-era Operation Allies Welcome program and was granted asylum in April 2025.

Trump escalates his anti-immigration crackdown after National Guard shooting \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:43 PM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  is doubling down on the aggressive anti-immigration policies that helped deliver him a second term, launching an interagency federal investigation into the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, while also directing his administration to take steps to stem migration into the US.\n \n\n   \n  In the hours following the shooting, an emboldened Trump addressed the American public. He painted a picture of a country overrun with “cuckoo” and “unvetted” migrants and he vowed a crackdown to expel them from the country and “permanently pause migration” from others – a priority he’s centered in his return to the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  “This heinous atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country. For the most part, we don’t want them,” the president said while addressing troops on Thanksgiving from Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  A series of announcements from Trump on Truth Social after the attack appeared to mark a major policy shift for the country. Though it remains unclear exactly how he will carry them out in practice, the efforts stand in line with the president’s campaign trail promises to fundamentally reshape the US immigration system.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect in Wednesday’s shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who came to the US in 2021 under “ Operation Allies Welcome, ” the Biden-era program to resettle Afghans in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024, which the Trump administration granted in April 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2011, Lakanwal worked with US forces, including the CIA. A senior US official told CNN the man had been vetted by intelligence agencies and was “ clean on all checks ” prior to working with US forces and being admitted into the country.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal will face a murder charge in connection with the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team believe they have a mandate to toughen immigration enforcement, with vows of deporting tens of millions of people central to his reelection platform. That has included removal flights, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in US cities including Chicago and Los Angeles and an executive order suspending the refugee program, though there  has been frustration  over lagging immigration arrests.\n \n\n   \n  In the immediate aftermath of the shooting near the White House, Trump began laying the groundwork to significantly bolster his anti-immigration agenda.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday evening, he quickly cast blame on his predecessor for allowing the suspect into the country as he called for the reexamination of every person who entered the US from Afghanistan under the Biden administration. Trump has since also expressed openness to deporting the suspect’s wife and children, telling reporters, “We’re looking at that right now – we’re looking at the whole situation with family.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s pledge only compounds efforts already underway from his administration. Earlier this week, CNN  reported  prior to the shooting that the administration was moving to reinterview certain refugees admitted to the US during the Biden administration as part of a comprehensive review of their cases.\n \n\n   \n  By Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow  announced  that at Trump’s direction, he had ordered “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.” Asked for additional details, including which countries are considered to be “of concern,” USCIS pointed CNN to 19 countries  listed  in a June presidential proclamation, including Afghanistan, Iran and Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Edlow also announced updated guidance that authorizes USCIS officers “to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests.” That policy, USCIS said in a  statement , will allow officers “to more meaningfully assess whether an alien is a threat to public safety and national security.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the president intensified his rhetoric, calling for what he described as “reverse migration.”\n \n\n   \n  “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” Trump said in a lengthy  post  to social media late Thursday evening, adding that he would “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  The State Department referred CNN to the White House on which countries would specifically be impacted. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump allies and aides commended the move.\n \n\n   \n  “This will prove to be the president’s most politically popular policy, ever,”  said  Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, the group founded by slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk that caters to youth on American campuses.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said his department was moving to block undocumented immigrants from receiving federal tax-based benefits, acting on orders from the president to reserve the programs for US citizens only.\n \n\n   \n  And  Edlow announced  the US was pausing all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to USCIS and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency, for additional details, including the number of asylum decisions pending.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2.2 million immigrants were waiting for asylum decisions or hearings at the end of August, according to data from Syracuse University’s  Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse .\n \n\n   \n  The State Department, meanwhile, paused visa issuances for travelers with Afghan passports.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates have warned that Trump’s rhetoric and actions could harm the Afghan community in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Shawn VanDiver, the CEO of AfghanEvac, said that the suspect’s “isolated and violent act should not be used as an excuse to define or diminish an entire community.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 190,000 Afghans have resettled in the United States since August 2021, according to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Criticism of the administration’s efforts in the wake of the shooting that has claimed the life of at least one of the victims drew a strong response from Trump’s influential deputy chief of staff — and the top architect of his immigration policy.\n \n\n   \n  In response to an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board arguing that Afghan refugees “shouldn’t be blamed for the violent act of one man,” Stephen Miller  called the assertion  “the great lie of mass migration,” while providing insight into how he broadly views immigration.\n \n\n   \n  “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies. No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders.

Their contents end up at a store in Alabama \n       \n  By Faith Karimi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:42 PM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vee Aronds gazed at her reflection in the mirror as she tried on a satin-and-lace wedding dress. She patted the fitted bodice and twirled to see the length of the train.\n \n\n   \n  Surrounded by racks of formal gowns, Aronds was on a mission to uncover hidden treasures at the sprawling Unclaimed Baggage store, which describes itself as the nation’s only seller of items from lost luggage.\n \n\n   \n  Millions of clothing items, pieces of jewelry, electronics and other abandoned belongings end up each year at this singular store in northeastern Alabama.\n \n\n   \n  As she admired the flowing white dress from different angles, Aronds mused about its journey from an airport carousel to the store.\n \n\n   \n  Who had owned it, she wondered? Did the suitcase get lost on the way to the wedding — or after? Would the owner recognize her intricate dress if she saw it in the store?\n \n\n   \n  Inside the 50,000 square-foot space, rows of clothes, shoes, books, electronics and other inventory from lost suitcases stretch as far as the eye can see. On this day they included a mix of unique items – left-handed kitchen shears – and whimsical ones, such as a papier-maché Tinker Bell from Disney’s “Peter Pan” dangling from the ceiling.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines typically spend three to four months trying to reunite lost suitcases with their owners. If they can’t, they sell the bags to Unclaimed Baggage, which separates items into batches to be sold, thrown away or donated to charity, said Bryan Owens, the store’s owner. Bargain hunters then scoop up the store’s merchandise at discount prices.\n \n\n   \n  Aronds, 55, and her partner drove to Scottsboro from Ooltewah, Tennessee, one day last November. It was her first visit to the store, and she’d envisioned a wonderland of partially opened bags bursting with clothes, accessories and untold secrets.\n \n\n   \n  “I was prepared to dig through suitcases,” she said. “But now that I’m here, I prefer this setup — it’s so much easier to find things.”\n \n\n   \n  Her partner, Frederick Stewart, 75, watched from a bench as Aronds tossed a black gown with dark sequins into her shopping cart, joining a growing pile that included several multicolored kaftans.\n \n\n   \n  She said she loved the wedding dress. But she couldn’t bring herself to buy it. Not just yet.\n \n\n   \n    Lost luggage items have included wigs, sharks’ teeth and two live snakes\n \n\n   \n  The Unclaimed Baggage store launched in 1970. Owens’ father, Doyle Owens, started it after a friend who worked for Trailways bus service told him he had mountains of unclaimed luggage and didn’t know what to do with it.\n \n\n   \n  “My dad grew up somewhat in a retail business and he thought, ‘I can help you with that,’” Bryan Owens said.\n \n\n   \n  The elder Owens borrowed $300 and a 1965 Chevy pickup truck and drove to Washington, D.C. to collect the suitcases. The family put ads in a Scottsboro newspaper announcing they were selling items from unclaimed baggage. People showed up in such large numbers that the items regularly sold out.\n \n\n   \n  As business boomed, Doyle Owens quit his job in the insurance industry and focused on his new venture.\n \n\n   \n  Bryan Owens bought the store from his parents in 1995. His father died two decades later, but not before he got a chance to see the store expand its reach beyond this Alabama city of 16,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  In the 55 years since it started, Unclaimed Baggage has gone international, with online purchases that ship to customers overseas. It’s become one of the area’s main tourist attractions and draws more than 1 million visitors annually, Owens said.\n \n\n   \n  The vast majority of the store’s inventory is from luggage lost during air travel, although the store receives some unclaimed bags from trains and buses. Unclaimed Baggage also sells items left in seat pockets, overhead bins and in hand luggage, said Sonni Hood, the store’s spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  Among the quirkier items discovered in luggage last year: a funeral casket key, a suitcase packed with wigs, a jar full of shark teeth and two live rat snakes stashed in a duffel bag. The store released the non-venomous reptiles into the wild.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the more unusual items found in luggage over the decades are showcased in a small museum inside the store. They include a suit of armor, a set of bagpipes,   a Gucci bag filled with Egyptian historical artifacts and a puppet — of Hoggle, a grumpy dwarf — used in the 1986 fantasy movie “Labyrinth.”\n \n\n   \n  One lost bag contained a custom Nikon camera designed for the space shuttle. Turns out, someone from NASA had lost it during transit.  The store turned it over to the space agency, Owens said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like Christmas every day – we never know what we’ll find,” he said. “I look at it like an archaeological dig.”\n \n\n   \n    Airlines sell bags to the store after they’ve exhausted efforts to match them with their owners\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, airlines mishandled  an average of 6.3 bags  per 1,000 passengers, according to SITA, an industry expert on air transport. More than 99.5% of suitcases are eventually reunited with their owners, but the small fraction of lost bags adds up, Hood said. In August 2024 alone, for example, federal statistics show airlines mishandled more than 260,000 bags in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines typically spend three to four months trying to match the unclaimed bags with their owners before selling them to the store. Some bags go unclaimed because they have no identifying information.\n \n\n   \n  By the time the bags end up at the store, the airlines have already compensated the owners, per federal regulations, up to  $4,700 per passenger  for a lost bag on a domestic flight.\n \n\n   \n  The store buys each bag as is, without taking inventory of its contents. The bags are taken to a warehouse, where their items are sorted and cleaned.\n \n\n   \n  Used undergarments are not sold; only new ones that still have price tags on them, Hood said. Tech experts remove personal data from electronic devices and test them to ensure they work.\n \n\n   \n  About 7,000 new items arrive at the store each day, Hood said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to a handful of US-based airlines with questions about how their process works. Two — United Airlines and Southwest — confirmed that they send lost suitcases to the facility in Alabama after they’ve exhausted options to reunite them with their owners.\n \n\n   \n  United said it sends suitcases after 90 days, while Southwest does so after 120 days. Other domestic airlines contacted by CNN did not respond.\n \n\n   \n    The store’s wares are a reflection of the changing culture\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, items recovered from lost suitcases have reflected changing cultural trends. During the store’s infancy, travelers often left their Walkmans – portable music players – on planes, along with cassettes by such ‘70s artists as Joni Mitchell.   Today, travelers leave AirPods, phones and tablets, along with T-shirts and other merchandise from Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a snapshot of what’s going on with travelers, and a slice of society in general,” Owens said.\n \n\n   \n  The most frequently found items include sneakers, blouses and blue jeans – although more formal clothing turns up as well. Filmmaker Daniel Scheinert, who won an Oscar last year for co-directing “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” famously   delivered his acceptance speech in a tuxedo  purchased from the Unclaimed Baggage store .\n \n\n   \n  Items in the store are priced at between 20% to 80% off retail prices, Hood said. But that doesn’t mean they sell cheap junk, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not a thrift store. Thrift stores are full of things that people no longer want. Our store is full of things that people loved so much, they packed them to take on vacation. So it’s usually going to be nicer items.”\n \n\n   \n  Wade Dubose, 59, is a self-proclaimed super shopper who goes to the store several times a day to hunt for bargains.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like going on an adventure — you never know what you’re gonna get,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  On a recent visit, he scattered his planned purchases on the floor around him. They included a pair of Nikon binoculars, tailgating fans, hand warmers and a golf cart cover.\n \n\n   \n  As an entrepreneur who purchases items and resells them, Dubose relies on the store for his inventory. “I buy anything, as long as it’s a deal,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The store once sold a Rolex watch for $32,000\n \n\n   \n  Andolyn Parrish, 28, grew up in Scottsboro but moved to Nashville, where she works as a salesperson. She visits her hometown regularly to see family and shop at the store.\n \n\n   \n  On a recent trip, she pushed a shopping cart overflowing with clothes. At the top was a silver $10 jacket that she said would spruce up her work outfits.\n \n\n   \n  One of Parrish’s most expensive purchases was a vintage Louis Vuitton duffel that cost her $350 but retails for thousands of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  “Something that I could never afford at retail prices, but I was able to pick it up here,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Hood, the store’s spokesperson, said their most expensive item ever was a platinum Rolex watch that retailed for $64,000 but was sold at the store for half that. The store’s current top-ticket item is  a solitaire diamond ring  priced at $19,491.\n \n\n   \n  “When I look around here, I see a store full of found things,  not lost things — items given a second chance,” said Hood, who started working at the store in high school as a fitting room helper.\n \n\n   \n  “Through loss, there’s a chance for hope and redemption. Through our donations, we transform lives. Loss in any way is devastating. But how incredible is it to transform that into something positive for others?”\n \n\n   \n    The store is not a lost and found — but one woman discovered her old ski boots\n \n\n   \n  The store rarely reunites people with their lost items.\n \n\n   \n  Owens and Hood recalled only one known case a few years ago, when a shopper from Atlanta attended the store’s annual November ski sale, which draws people from all over the nation. Lines wrap around the building, and some customers pitch tents in the parking lot overnight to secure a spot at the front.\n \n\n   \n  The man bought ski boots that day for his girlfriend. When he got home, they discovered her name engraved in the boots and realized they were the same pair she’d lost during a trip. The airlines had already compensated her for the lost luggage.\n \n\n   \n  “They ended up in our store, and they came full circle back to her,” Owens said.\n \n\n   \n  The store has a procedure for destroying documents, IDs, prescriptions and other sensitive information found in suitcases. Eyeglasses are donated to the local Lions Club.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not in the business of reunification,” Hood said. “We are in the business of giving these items a second life.”\n \n\n   \n  The store’s customers are happy to help with that effort. Aronds left the store last week with a bag of clothes — minus the wedding dress.\n \n\n   \n  “He hasn’t proposed, so why should I get it?” she said with a laugh. “Come on, a man has to ask first.”\n \n\n   \n  Stewart chuckled. “I’m going to marry this woman one day,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  If he does, Aronds plans to give a wedding   dress from the store another walk down the aisle.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/americas/honduras-trump-election-candidates-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"19:39:00-05:00","title":"Hondurans Face Elections Under the Shadow of Trump and Fraud Allegations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Honduras is set to hold general elections in November 2025 under intense scrutiny due to allegations of fraud and political interference, with the country’s electoral process threatened by internal divisions and external influence.

PM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Honduras  on Sunday will hold general elections marked by preemptive allegations of voting fraud and an intervention by the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The presidential race has been clouded by uncertainty. Out of the several candidates running to succeed Honduran President  Xiomara Castro , three have emerged as the frontrunners, but there is no clear favorite to win.\n \n\n   \n  “We are in an election with a deep political and economic divide,” political scientist Héctor Soto Caballero told CNN. “It highlights the clash between two completely different visions for the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Castro’s term is due to end on January 27, which would mark the first time a left-wing president has finished a term in the country. Her husband, leftist former President Manuel Zelaya, was overthrown in a coup in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  The president is supporting the left-wing candidate of the ruling Liberty and Refoundation Party (LIBRE), lawyer Rixi Moncada, who was the country’s first female defense minister and has promised to continue Castro’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  While Honduras’ economy has shown moderate growth under Castro, who has maintained her social protection focus and continued the International Monetary Fund’s credit program, the campaign has shifted focus to other polarizing issues.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s at stake isn’t the typical campaign promises, with problems related to health, education and security. LIBRE came in and proposed a discussion that touches the very foundations of the system: democratizing the economy. But it’s not proposing this through dialogue with the business sector; instead, it’s confrontational. This has polarized society,” said analyst Soto.\n \n\n   \n  Also in the running is centrist-liberal Salvador Nasralla, a populist of the Liberal Party. The television star is a former ally of Castro who served as her vice president until last year. He has called for labor reforms and stronger trade relations with the West.\n \n\n   \n  The candidate of the National Party is right-wing businessman and former Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry “Tito” Asfura. The construction magnate who is running on a free market platform has been endorsed by US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Allegations of fraud\n \n\n   \n  Both the ruling party and the opposition have fanned allegations of voting fraud ahead of the election, which critics say undermines the system’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  The tense climate is putting pressure on the National Electoral Council (CNE), an independent body led by three councilors from each of the country’s major political parties.\n \n\n   \n  Recently, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Honduras Armed Forces, Roosevelt Hernández, asked the council for a copy of the presidential ballot records on election day, something not stipulated by law. CNE president Ana Paola Hall described the move as “interference.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Armed Forces is disobeying the National Electoral Council (CNE),” said Sánchez, who expressed fears that they will use force if the results are not recognized. In that regard, she said the situation would follow “the same script as Nicaragua and Venezuela,” two nations whose electoral processes have been denounced and are not recognized by numerous countries in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Castro said this week on X that her government “upholds and honors” the principles of personal freedom, democracy and accountability, among others.\n \n\n   \n  International organizations have aired their concerns. Americas director at Human Rights Watch Juanita Goebertus warned in a statement that “allegations of possible fraud, aggressive moves by both prosecutors and the army, and political deadlock in the electoral authority are threatening Hondurans’ right to participate in free and fair elections.”\n \n\n   \n  The Organization of American States (OAS) and the European Union have also called on the authorities to guarantee the independence of the electoral body.\n \n\n   \n  Eduardo Fuentes, co-director of CNE acknowledged that “there were atypical circumstances and very conflicting positions,” but assured that the institution has met most of its duties.\n \n\n   \n    Honduras’ foreign policy and Washington’s influence\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the tensions is pressure from the US, Honduras’s largest trading partner.\n \n\n   \n  Trump endorsed right-wing candidate Asfura this week, saying on Truth Social they could work together “to combat the narco-communists and provide the necessary aid to the Honduran people.” Trump added that Asfura “stands up for democracy and fights against Maduro,” the  Venezuelan president  who is facing a months-long pressure campaign from the US.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump made another post, saying he would pardon former Honduran President  Juan Orlando Hernandez  of the conservative National Party, who is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the US after being convicted of drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Soto says opposition candidates have been signaling their ideological ties to Washington, while the ruling party has been committed to maintaining a transactional relationship with the US.\n \n\n   \n  “If Nasralla wins, he has openly shown himself to be accommodating to the US leadership. In Asfura’s case, he wouldn’t be much opposition (to the White House); it would be a close influence,” Soto said.\n \n\n   \n  Castro’s ruling party has met many of Washington’s demands on security and migration issues while avoiding direct confrontation. The country is heavily impacted by US immigration measures such as the end of the temporary protected status (TPS) for immigrants, which affected tens of thousands of Hondurans in the US; and remittances, which represent approximately 25% of Honduras’ GDP, according to World Bank data.\n \n\n   \n  Sánchez pointed out that the relationship “could change drastically if the opposition wins,” saying that Trump would not be satisfied if the ruling party stays in power.\n \n\n   \n  Honduras has fewer tools than other countries to confront this asymmetrical relationship with the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “We depend more on the United States and on relations in Central America,” Sánchez said, recalling that Trump has already threatened to impose taxes on remittances and that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not include Honduras in his tour of Central America and the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Another key aspect of Honduras’ foreign policy is its relationship with  Venezuela , whose ruling Chavismo movement strongly supported Castro’s husband after his coup. “That built long-standing relations. The government is definitely a close actor, but it has understood that it is a complex, uncomfortable relationship,” Soto said.\n \n\n   \n  Castro was one of the few leaders in the region who recognized Nicolás Maduro’s 2024 election victory claim. Her handpicked successor Moncada has avoided commenting on Venezuela during the campaign, while opposition candidates assured that they would break relations with Caracas if they became president.\n \n\n   \n  According to Soto, if tensions between the US and Venezuela were to escalate into a military conflict, it would lead to an increased US presence in Honduras, where American military personnel are stationed at La Palmerola air base. “From a hemispheric perspective, it would have an impact, at least logistically. If there were a government more aligned with Washington, it would be an opportunity to foster closer ties,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House also faces another challenge in Honduras:  China’s growing influence  throughout Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Honduras established diplomatic ties with China in 2023 and severed relations with Taiwan. However, Soto points out that there has been no significant progress toward a free trade agreement since relations were established.\n \n\n   \n  Miami Strategic Intelligence Institute (MSII), a conservative think tank based in Florida, said in a recent report that the election outcomes could “either deepen Beijing’s foothold or recalibrate toward US-aligned positions.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/style/miss-england-lesbian-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"A national beauty pageant got its first out lesbian winner","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Grace Richardson, a 20-year-old musical theater student, has made history by becoming the first out lesbian winner of the Miss England beauty pageant, crowned in Wolverhampton on November 21, 2025.

An Afghan national who previously worked with the CIA named as suspect in DC National Guard shooting. Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, Chelsea Bailey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:24 PM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A West Virginia National Guard member has died and another is in critical condition after  a gunman opened fire near the White House  the day before Thanksgiving, in an attack that has added fuel to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n   US Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom , 20, had been in the service for just over two years when she was shot and killed in the nation’s capital, the president said in a call to service members on Thanksgiving. He described the young soldier who volunteered to work over the holiday as “outstanding in every way.”\n \n\n   \n  The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who officials say came to the US in 2021 under a program implemented by the Biden administration following the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The suspect was also wounded and taken to the hospital, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal had  previously worked in Afghanistan  with the CIA, according to the agency’s director, John Ratcliffe. He was granted asylum in April by the Trump administration, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump called the shooting an “act of terror” in remarks from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The president called for a reexamination of every person from Afghanistan who came to the US under President Joe Biden, and criticized what he claimed were millions of “unknown and unvetted foreigners” admitted to the country under his predecessor.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the shooting, the suspect and the response:\n \n\n   \n    Suspect granted asylum earlier this year after arriving in the US in 2021\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal arrived in the US on September 8, 2021, as part of a program called  Operation Allies Welcome , Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration after applying in 2024, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In August 2021, Biden launched the  Operation Allies Welcome  program to protect vulnerable Afghans following the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s return to power.\n \n\n   \n  More than 190,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US under both Operation Allies Welcome and the  program that replaced it , known as Enduring Welcome,  according to the State Department. \n \n\n   \n  Most Afghans who arrived under Operation Allies Welcome were allowed to enter and remain in the US for two years without permanent immigration status. More than 40% of those admitted to the program were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) because they took great risks to help the US, or were related to someone who did, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to Fox News Wednesday, Ratcliffe said, “The Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the US government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”\n \n\n   \n  Family members of Lakanwal have told authorities he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, which they said stemmed from the fighting he did in Afghanistan, where he fought in a CIA-sponsored-and-trained “Zero Unit” of Afghan special forces, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the case told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have interviewed the suspect’s spouse, each one of his five children and others around him, according to the sources.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has maintained Lakanwal was insufficiently vetted by his predecessor, a senior US official told CNN Lakanwal would have had to undergo extensive vetting to work with the CIA.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal began working with the CIA around 2011 and at the time the agency would have conducted vetting through a variety of databases – including the National Counterterrorism Center database – to determine if he had any known ties to terrorist groups, the senior official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A decade later, Afghans admitted to the US under Operation Allies Welcome also underwent  extensive vetting , despite claims to the contrary by Trump and his allies at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal would have been among those vetted in 2021 before being allowed to enter the US as a part of the program, the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of vetting, nothing came up,” the senior US official said. “He was clean on all checks.”\n \n\n   \n  He would have undergone continuous, annual vetting, especially in the wake of the  failed terror plot  disrupted before the election last year in Oklahoma, which involved an Afghan evacuee, the official says.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in order to process his asylum claim, immigration officials with the Trump administration would have examined Lakanwal’s background earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The vetting of people overseas by US intelligence agencies is different than what domestic agencies are expected to do once people arrive and are seeking asylum, a second official noted.\n \n\n   \n    Suspect had been absent from local mosque, neighbor tells CNN\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have said Lakanwal allegedly drove cross-country from his home in Bellingham, Washington, to the nation’s capital prior to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Washington, his neighbor, who requested anonymity to protect his privacy, told CNN the alleged gunman lived in the apartment complex with his wife, five children and two nephews.\n \n\n   \n  He described Lakanwal as a “simple and nice guy,” and said the two attended the same local mosque. But, he added, the suspect had not been seen at the mosque in more than two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t see him; he disappeared,” the neighbor said. “He was not coming … somebody said he’s sick, someone else said he went somewhere.”\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal’s full work history in the US is not known, but Amazon confirmed a person with that name was an independent contractor with the company for one month this past summer, working for their Amazon Flex delivery service.\n \n\n   \n  His neighbor told CNN the suspect once told him he had worked with the US military in Afghanistan, but to his knowledge, Lakanwal was currently unemployed and looking for work.\n \n\n   \n    National Guard members identified as officials vow prosecution\n \n\n   \n  A small memorial now marks the spot where two West Virginia National Guard members were shot Wednesday in downtown Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Beckstrom was remembered by Trump as a “highly respected, young, magnificent person.”\n \n\n   \n  She began her military service in June 2023 and was part of the 111th Engineer Brigade within the West Virginia Army National Guard, the president said.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard member Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition, US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said at a news conference Thursday. His father, Jason Wolfe, called him a “fighter.”\n \n\n   \n  Jason Wolfe told CNN’s Gabe Cohen he asks everyone to “keep my son in your prayers.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a great person,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Beckstrom’s father previously  told The New York Times  his daughter suffered a “mortal wound” and was not likely to recover.\n \n\n   \n  Beckstrom was from Summersville, West Virginia, and Wolfe is from Martinsburg, West Virginia. Both have been deployed to the district under the DC Safe and Beautiful Mission “since the beginning of the mission in August of this year,” according to a  statement  from the West Virginia National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, today, as most families join together to give thanks for the blessings that have been bestowed upon them, two families have been shattered and destroyed and have been torn apart as a result of the actions of one man,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n  The Guard members “answered the call, they took the charge, they volunteered, they put their lives on the line for people they don’t even know,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Fox News Friday morning, Pirro said Lakanwal will now face a murder charge following Beckstrom’s death.\n \n\n   \n  “There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” Pirro told Fox News this morning.\n \n\n   \n  Pirro previously said Lakanwal will be charged with assault with intent to kill and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. He faces 15 years in prison under the assault with the intent to kill charge, she said.\n \n\n   \n  At a separate news conference Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration will do “everything in our power” to seek the death penalty following the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  She added at a minimum, the alleged suspect could face “life in prison with terrorism charges.”\n \n\n   \n    Guard members ambushed in shocking attack, officials say\n \n\n   \n  Since the shooting, Pirro said, investigators across multiple agencies have worked around the clock to learn more about the alleged gunman.\n \n\n   \n  She said Lakanwal resided in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and children.\n \n\n   \n  “What we know about him is that he drove his vehicle across country from the state of Washington with the intended target of coming to our nation’s capital,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n  “A lone gunman opened fire without provocation, ambush-style, armed with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver.”\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel said the motive for the attack remains under investigation, but the shooting is being treated as an act of terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s attack took place around 2:15 p.m. in Farragut Square, a tourist-heavy area near a busy transit center and the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The two National Guard members were performing “high visibility patrols” when the suspect approached, raised a gun and started shooting at them, Executive Assistant Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department Jeffery Carroll said at a news conference following the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Carroll said after “some back and forth,” fellow Guard members were “able to subdue” the suspect and take him into custody.\n \n\n   \n  DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded to provide first aid, Carroll said. The suspect and the wounded National Guard members were transported to area hospitals, he added.\n \n\n   \n  An eyewitness named Patrick told CNN he was about to enter a nearby bar around 2:10 p.m. when he heard loud bangs and saw people running.\n \n\n   \n  “They were thick gunshots. I mean, I couldn’t really tell if it was a rifle or a pistol, but some type of big caliber,” said Patrick, who declined to give his last name.\n \n\n   \n  Once he stopped hearing gunshots, he walked to the intersection and saw two National Guard members and a third person on the ground. Shattered glass from the bus stop covered the area. He said people were performing CPR on one of the Guard members, while the other had blood near their head.\n \n\n   \n  Following the shooting, Trump asked for 500 more National Guard troops to be deployed to the nation’s capital, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  That request came despite an ongoing legal battle over whether the original National Guard deployment was legal. On Wednesday, the Trump administration also asked a federal appeals court for an emergency stay of last week’s order from a federal judge to remove the National Guard from Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n    Trump ramps up anti-immigration rhetoric\n \n\n   \n  As a multi-agency investigation into the shooting begins, President Trump and his administration have begun ramping up the anti-immigration rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  In a video address from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump blamed the Biden administration for bringing the alleged shooter to the US and argued the attack “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump lamented what he described as “20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners” who entered the US during his predecessor’s administration, casting it as “a risk to our very survival.”\n \n\n   \n  The president described the suspect as a “foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hell hole on Earth.” In the same remarks, he also took aim at Somali immigrants living in Minnesota, claiming they are “ripping off our country and ripping apart that once-great state,” casting Somalia as a country that has “no laws, no water, no military, no nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump vowed to “re-examine every single alien who has entered our country under Biden,” a process that has already begun, as  CNN reported earlier this week. \n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Trump’s address, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it had stopped processing immigration cases related to Afghan immigrants “pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”\n \n\n   \n  “The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the agency said in a  statement on X .\n \n\n   \n   Correction: A previous version of this story misstated which state the National Guard soldiers were from. They are from West Virginia. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/world/andriy-yermak-ukraine-corruption-raid-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"12:57:00.000Z","title":"Zelensky’s top aide and key peace negotiator resigns after anti-corruption raid of his home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andriy Yermak, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky and lead negotiator in Ukraine's peace talks with the United States, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home by Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO).

He has been leading the Ukrainian delegation during recent talks in Geneva with Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Yermak’s resignation, which was announced by Zelensky on Friday, complicates Kyiv’s position going into crucial peace negotiations with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “I want no one to have any questions about Ukraine today. Therefore, today we have the following internal decisions. First, there will be a reboot of the Office of the President of Ukraine. The head of the office, Andriy Yermak, has written a letter of resignation,” Zelensky said in his daily TV address.\n \n\n   \n  Yermak did not immediately issue a public statement. He confirmed earlier on Friday that the raid was going on, saying on Telegram that he was “fully cooperating” with the authorities.\n \n\n   \n  “The investigators are not encountering any obstacles. They have been given full access to the apartment, and my lawyers are on site, interacting with law enforcement officials,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Both of Ukraine’s two main anti-corruption bodies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), were involved in the searches, according to a statement released by the agencies on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The statement did not disclose the reason for the raids, but the raid comes just two weeks after the two agencies announced a sweeping investigation into an alleged kickback scheme concerning Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The scandal has already taken down two of Zelensky’s ministers and embroiled a former business associate from his days in the entertainment industry.\n \n\n   \n  But the latest development is particularly awkward for Zelensky given Yermak’s recent elevation to the top of Ukraine’s negotiating team.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear who will take Yermak’s spot in the next rounds of the negotiations, expected as early as the next few days. Announcing the resignation, Zelensky said he would be speaking to possible candidates to take up the chief of staff post on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian leader said the delegation that will be meeting the US team will include the Chief of the General Staff, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, and Ukraine’s intelligence services.\n \n\n   \n  Talks with the United States have been difficult. Last week, the Trump administration came up with a  28-point peace plan  that largely reflected Russia’s extensive wishlist, including demands for Ukraine to give up territory, reduce its army and be barred from joining NATO.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian and European officials strongly opposed that version of the peace plan and Yermak’s delegation managed to convince the US to revise it.\n \n\n   \n  More talks have been scheduled for the coming days. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he was expecting a US delegation to arrive to Moscow early next week, while Zelensky said the Ukrainian team was also set to meet the Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Russia said it was monitoring developments following Yermak’s resignation.\n \n\n   \n  “What we see is that the corruption scandal and uncertainty, political uncertainty, that is caused by this scandal is growing and growing very fast day by day. One can hardly now make a prognosis on what is going to happen next,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are watching very carefully the situation, while of course pursuing our own goals by continuing the special military operation and then continuing to be open for negotiations and getting prepared for meeting with (US envoy Steve) Witkoff,” Peskov added.\n \n\n   \n  While some US officials, including President Donald Trump, have touted great progress being made this week, any chances of a swift breakthrough appear slim, especially after  Putin indicated  on Thursday that he is unwilling to budge from his maximalist demands.\n \n\n   \n    Corruption woes\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has long been seen as one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, a major obstacle to its aspirations to join the European Union.\n \n\n   \n  The EU has made it clear to Kyiv that it must implement strong anti-graft measures if it wants to become a member and the Biden administration urged the Ukrainian government to do more to  root out corruption in 2023. \n \n\n   \n  Fighting rampant government corruption was also Zelensky’s main campaign pledge ahead of the 2019 election. A former comedian who played Ukraine’s president on a hit TV show, Zelensky had zero political experience before his victory – but he tapped into voters’ dismay on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  During the war, Zelensky has  fired a slew of senior Ukrainian officials  over corruption allegations, and his government has instigated  anti-corruption measures , including the National Anti-Corruption Strategy.\n \n\n   \n  International organizations, including the EU, the United Nations and the G7 group of leading industrialized nations have previously praised Zelensky’s government for its anti-corruption efforts, including the fact that even the country’s top officials are no longer beyond the reach of law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the latest developments on Friday, Paula Pinho, the spokesperson for the European Commission, said the investigations “show that the anti-corruption bodies in Ukraine are doing their work.”\n \n\n   \n  But Zelensky’s decision earlier this year to fast-track a new law that granted oversight of the NABU and SAPO agencies to the prosecutor general, a politically appointed figure, was seen as a series misstep.\n \n\n   \n  Criticised by anti-corruption watchdogs at home and abroad, as well as the EU, the move sparked  Ukraine’s first anti-government protests  since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The public anger forced Zelensky to quickly  reverse track  and restore the agencies’ independence.\n \n\n   \n  But that episode, coupled with the recent allegations wielded against some of Zelensky’s closest allies, including his former business partner Timur Mindich, his former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and now Yermak, are putting more pressure on the Ukrainian leader at a time when he is facing difficult negotiations with the US and Russia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/entertainment/celine-dion-thanksgiving-stiff-person-syndrome","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"09:44:00-05:00","title":"Celine Dion Releases a Powerful Thanksgiving Message","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Celine Dion, the globally acclaimed singer, shared a heartfelt Thanksgiving message emphasizing gratitude, family connection, and mindfulness.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:13 PM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The number of people killed in the devastating Hong Kong apartment complex fire has risen to 128 with as many as 200 missing, officials said Friday, as authorities announced eight more arrests over the blaze.\n \n\n   \n  The  inferno rapidly spread  in a public housing estate in the city’s Tai Po neighborhood on Wednesday, trapping people inside. With authorities warning the toll will likely rise further, focus is turning to what caused the territory’s worst fire in decades.\n \n\n   \n  Fire alarms in all eight buildings of the complex were “not functional,” officials found during inspections carried out after the blaze, according to Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung. It was not clear if the alarm system was operational on the day of the fire, though residents  previously told CNN  their building alarm did not ring.\n \n\n   \n  “On this, we will take law enforcement action,” Yeung said.\n \n\n   \n  Eight people were arrested on Friday as part of ongoing investigations, the city’s anti-corruption body said. They include two directors of a consultancy firm that was advising on maintenance works at the complex, two project managers responsible for supervising the works, three scaffolding subcontractors and an intermediary.\n \n\n   \n  Three men working for a construction company were arrested earlier this week on suspicion of “manslaughter by way of gross negligence,” officials said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  All three were granted bail on Friday, Hong Kong Police said. The men – two company directors and a consultant – are required to report back to police in early December.\n \n\n   \n  The blaze has sent shock waves through the skyscraper-filled city, which has a usually strong public safety record and construction standards.\n \n\n   \n  Displaced residents and survivors, many of whom faced a third night in temporary shelters on Friday, are  asking how such a disaster could happen , while others were waiting in desperation to hear whether their missing loved ones are among those killed.\n \n\n   \n  The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. A police investigation into why the blaze quickly spread from building to building, turning a single tower block fire into multiple simultaneous multi-story infernos, is expected to take three to four weeks, Yeung said.\n \n\n   \n  The families of those who died in the fire will receive HK$200,000 (roughly $25,700 USD) from the government, Alice Mak, Hong Kong’s secretary for home and youth affairs, said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Households affected by the fire will also receive HK$50,000 (around $6,400 USD) living allowance in the upcoming week, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities believe the initial blaze started on the lower floors of Wang Cheong House, Block 6 of eight towers that make up  Wang Fuk Court, a tightly packed complex  that was home to more than 4,000 people, many of them elderly.\n \n\n   \n  Wang Fuk Court was undergoing renovations at the time of the fire, and all eight towers were wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green protective meshing. Police previously found the construction company name on flammable polystyrene boards that firefighters found blocking some windows at the apartment complex.\n \n\n   \n  “It ignited the mesh nets (and) quickly spread to the polystyrene boards around the windows, resulting in the fire in other floors and buildings,” Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security Chris Tang said.\n \n\n   \n  “After the polystyrene caught fire, the high temperature caused windows to shatter, causing the fire to spread indoors.”\n \n\n   \n  As the mesh nets and bamboo scaffolding caught fire and fell, it spread the fire to other floors, Tang said. Firefighters and residents faced extreme conditions inside the buildings, with temperatures reaching above 500 degrees Celsius (930 degrees Fahrenheit), he added.\n \n\n   \n  Tang said the mesh nets did comply with safety standards.\n \n\n   \n  Among the 16 inspections the Labor Department had conducted on the buildings’ maintenance works since last year the most recent one took place less than a week before the blaze broke out, Chris Sun, Hong Kong’s secretary for labor and welfare, told the media on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Sun said the last inspection was conducted because of a complaint that some workers were smoking.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, a written reminder was issued regarding fire safety, instructing the contractor to strengthen its fire-prevention measures,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Fire rescue efforts were further complicated as some units inside the buildings reignited, even after their flames had been extinguished by firefighters.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s labor department is working with the city’s Indonesian and Philippine consulates to help them in assisting foreign domestic helpers who lived in the buildings, Sun said.

exemption \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orbán  met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Friday to shore up Hungary’s energy supplies and discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Having spurned chances to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, Hungary was facing a  violent economic shock  after the Trump administration last month imposed  sanctions  on Russia’s two biggest oil producers. Before the sanctions were announced, Orbán had warned that, without energy imports from Russia, Hungary’s economy would be brought “to its knees.”\n \n\n   \n  But Orbán, a hard-right populist and a darling of the MAGA movement, was spared that shock after US President Donald Trump granted Hungary a  one-year exemption  from the sanctions, saying   it had been “difficult” for his ally to wean the country off Russian oil since it is landlocked.\n \n\n   \n  “We recently travelled to Washington to secure Hungary’s exemption from the American sanctions on Russian energy: we succeeded. Now we must take the next step, guaranteeing that deliveries to Hungary continue without interruption,” Orbán wrote on social media Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “This is why I am going to Russia today: to make sure Hungary’s energy supply remains secure and affordable this winter and in the year ahead,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump, explaining why he was considering granting Hungary an exemption, said it had been “very difficult for him (Orbán) to get the oil and gas from other areas” since “they don’t have ports,” analysts have disputed this reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  After Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, European Union countries moved to slash Russian energy imports in a bid to deplete the Kremlin’s war chest. However, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Central European nations – were given an exemption from a ban on importing   Russian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  While the Czech Republic has since phased out Russian crude oil, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Russian crude oil made up 86% of all Hungarian purchases of crude in 2024, up from 61% pre-invasion. So far this year, 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports have been from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to a  report  in May from the Center for the Study of Democracy and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n \n\n   \n  Isaac Levi, an analyst at CREA, told CNN earlier this month that the latest US exemption is a “terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over €1 billion ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin’s war chest.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the Trump administration’s rationale for the exemption was not credible, since the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, no longer imports Russian crude oil and has lower fuel prices at the pump than Hungary. “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin’s war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” Levi said.\n \n\n   \n  During Friday’s meeting in Moscow, Orbán and Putin also discussed recent US-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Putin did not rule out Friday the possibility of a summit in Budapest with Trump, Russian state media reported.\n \n\n   \n  Putin and Trump had agreed in October to meet in the Hungarian capital to discuss ending the conflict, but those plans were swiftly shelved, with Trump saying he did not want the talks to be a waste of time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/africa/zuma-south-africa-ukraine-parliament-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"08:22:00-05:00","title":"Zuma’s daughter quits South Africa parliament over Russia recruitment allegations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, daughter of former South African president Jacob Zuma, has resigned from the National Assembly following allegations that she recruited 17 South African men to fight for Russian mercenary forces in Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reluctance to accept any proposal that does not leave him in control of all of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region will likely remain clear over the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  The latest US proposal headed his way apparently strips that key concession from the plan leaked last week, something neither Kyiv nor its European allies consider militarily or politically wise. Given the decade-long history of this war – Russia’s three invasions of Ukrainian territory, over years of diplomacy and deceit – there is justification to doubt Moscow’s sincerity.\n \n\n   \n  This repetitive, cyclic failure to grasp the gulf between the two warring sides – hammered out in two separate negotiating tracks – is ultimately why progress always seems so close, yet also so unattainable. Negotiating one deal with Ukraine and then another with Russia, then hoping the two get close enough to hold, provides the tantalizing illusion of progress, but in practice leads nowhere. The sticking points stick.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the proposed deal involves putative, theoretical ideas about future alliances, financing or limits. But like parts of memorandums past, these elements may morph into something more practical, or disappear entirely, in the months after any deal is signed.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine won’t need an army of 600,000, the limit proposed in the draft deal, if it truly seeks peace. NATO membership will likely become less urgently needed, and less viable in peacetime, when Ukraine must demobilize and handle the economic nightmare of a post-war economy, with the damage that will do to its armed forces’ integrity.\n \n\n   \n  Will Russia rejoin the G8? It may want to, but the idea of Putin shaking hands at a summit with the leaders of the European states that still despise him seems farfetched. Who will pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction? Any grasp of how opaque business can be in Russia and Ukraine will tell you that won’t be simple or transparent, whatever the scheme. These points in any deal are important to address, but may alter in first contact with reality.\n \n\n   \n  The single most vital issue is whether any deal actually stops the war. And Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is likely headed towards again having to grapple with a hideous trade-off. He must weigh the value of future security guarantees, formalized by the United States and Europe, against the real and inevitable damage that conceding Donetsk would do to his, and Ukraine’s, political and military standing. It is a bad choice if a deal sticks. There is no choice if, in the long term, as before, the Kremlin does not honor the deal.\n \n\n   \n  But the immediate future does not bring better news. A myriad of crises envelope Zelensky’s government. President Donald ﻿Trump’s deadline has displaced from the headlines a corruption scandal that re-emerged Friday with the news that corruption investigators  searched the home  of his chief-of-staff and lead negotiator, Andriy Yermak.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s military has a manpower crisis. Funding from Kyiv’s European allies is in doubt next year, although the European Union recently said it thinks it can bridge the gap. And on the front lines, three separate crises are unfolding: Russia is moving fast in Zaporizhzhia, slowly but inevitably in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, and forwards in Kupiansk, further to the north. Ukraine cannot fight this many fires with so few soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  The remainder of Donetsk under Kyiv’s control is also imperiled this winter. The major military hub of Kramatorsk is already subject to Russian short-range drone attacks, as Moscow’s forces are close enough. Kyiv won’t be taking territory back from Russia any time soon. The calculus ahead for Kyiv and its allies is not when can they turn around the progress of the war, but rather, can they get the Russians to break first?\n \n\n   \n  The tacit hope of Kyiv and its allies, perhaps a forlorn one, is that Ukraine can push Russia’s brutal waste of manpower, and its total economic focus on the war, to the limit, and see it crack. It is impossible to predict in societies as closed as Russia how far away collapse might be. The Wagner rebellion of 2023 seemed fantastical, until Yevgeny Prigozhin’s men were on the road to Moscow over a turbulent 72 hours. Ukraine’s troubles are more open, and they are acute.\n \n\n   \n  The fight ahead for Zelensky is fraught with risk. Russia is better resourced and making serious advances on the ground. Ukraine’s fight is existential – it doesn’t have Moscow’s luxury of one day deciding it has had enough and stopping the onslaught. But the net impact of the last 10 months of lumbering, diplomatic confusion and whiplash have made an unthinkable deal closer to becoming possible.\n \n\n   \n  The idea of Ukraine ceding land to Moscow in exchange for peace was openly derided by Kyiv and Europe earlier this year, and throughout the Biden administration. Now it has found its way into the first iteration of the Trump 28-point peace plan. It has vanished from the leaked European counterproposal, but evidently not from Putin’s maximalist wish list.\n \n\n   \n  A cycle will surely now repeat itself. Trump’s special envoy Witkoff will likely hear once again during his visit to Moscow that Putin will not budge on his demand that Ukraine give up Donetsk in return for peace. Witkoff will communicate that to Trump. Zelensky will be pressured again, and another Thanksgiving-style deadline may ensue.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/democrats-data-centers-abundance","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Data centers powering the AI boom are pitting states against each other","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the AI boom drives massive expansion in data center construction across the U.S., states are locked in a political and economic competition over energy costs, water usage, and sustainability.

centers powering the AI boom are pitting states against each other \n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Just before her victory this fall, New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill jabbed at nearby Virginia, which also had a governor’s race, over its booming data center market.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, we need to produce power here in our state … because Virginia has a million data centers which are sucking all the power out of our market,” Sherrill said at one debate, “We need to produce here, lower costs here, and stop putting the costs on the ratepayers of New Jersey.” (Sherrill was exaggerating: Virginia has 666 data centers, according to  the Data Center Map , while New Jersey has 82.)\n \n\n   \n  A CNN reporter read Sherrill’s quote  just before the November 4 election  to Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger. Sherrill and Spanberger are  longtime friends and former roommates .\n \n\n   \n  “Mikie!” Spanberger responded. “Go ahead. We’ll take the revenue.”\n \n\n   \n  While Spanberger and others have celebrated the economic benefits of data centers, the incoming governor also noted in her victory speech that tech corporations would have to develop sustainably and cover their costs, with energy bills spiking across the region.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats campaigning on affordability are confronting the demands created by data centers that create jobs, often in areas that have long needed them, but that also suck up power. And the issue is converging with a national party debate about how to embrace economic development and growth — the  “Abundance” mindset .\n \n\n   \n  Officials and candidates across the country are lamenting rising power bills, water usage and the potential climate impact of the AI boom. But they’re hard-pressed to turn down job-creating investments that could go to their neighbors instead – a tension that’s felt beyond the East Coast.\n \n\n   \n  “We are, by the nature of the grid, connected to our neighboring states,” said Raúl Torrez, the Democratic attorney general in New Mexico. His state is next to Texas, which has 413 data centers, according to the Data Center Map, compared with New Mexico’s 22.\n \n\n   \n  “I will say that it is very difficult to be right next to a state that just takes a maybe less aggressive approach in terms of protecting consumers,” Torrez said.\n \n\n   \n    An interconnected problem\n \n\n   \n  Thirteen states and the District of Columbia are connected to the same grid as New Jersey and Virginia. That grid, known as PJM, is the country’s largest, covering a swath of competitive political territory.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the states on that grid are net producers of energy; others are net consumers. But the opening of data centers across nearly all of them is creating structural pressure on a shared system. Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, is set  to increase rates  by around 9%; in New Jersey, utility bills spiked by more than 20% this year. Communities across the region are protesting developments.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to produce more energy and we’re going to lower energy costs. We are going to produce more energy here in Virginia and make sure that data centers pay their fair share,” Spanberger said during her victory speech.\n \n\n   \n  But a review from the Virginia General Assembly last year laid out the scale of the challenge, even as it also found the data center industry contributes $9.1 billion in GDP to the state economy.\n \n\n   \n  “The state could encourage or require data centers to take actions to help address their energy impacts by promoting development of renewable energy generation, participating in demand response programs, and managing energy efficiency,” the General Assembly review reads. “However, these actions would have only a marginal impact on decreasing data center energy demand.”\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a potential 2028 presidential contender, outlined the challenge — and the escalating political stakes — at an energy conference in September. Utility rates in Pennsylvania  jumped  5% to 12% statewide this summer.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s face it: Change is needed to keep energy costs low, bring new energy generation onto the grid more quickly,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Cutting across state lines\n \n\n   \n  Data center campuses can offer a lifeline to communities eager for investment, promising jobs and tax receipts. They’re often developed in rural areas, far from traditional economic hotbeds. Microsoft, among the tech giants pouring billions into data centers, has touted its  community development  in Mecklenburg, a county in the southern portion of Virginia bordering North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Another Microsoft data center opened in the industrial area once set aside for Foxconn, the Taiwanese technology giant  that didn’t meet  its initial commitment during Trump’s first term to open an electronic plant.\n \n\n   \n  But that single data center requires more electricity than every home in Milwaukee, the state’s largest city, according to Mitchell Berman, a Democrat running for Congress in Wisconsin’s battleground 1st Congressional District next year.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t want to get in the way, or have too much of a regulatory burden. We need progress; that’s ultimately what drives our success in manufacturing, in AI and in the technology space,” Berman said. “But we have to do it within reason, and not at the expense of people in our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  Carol Obando-Derstine, a Democrat running in Pennsylvania’s 7th District next year, said she was “hearing from a lot of people all the time, reacting to news of data centers.”\n \n\n   \n  “What they are concerned about is the rising costs of utilities, what they pay for energy. When they see news of folks, these billionaire companies coming into the area, they are concerned about the impact it’ll have on their bills,” Obando-Derstine said.\n \n\n   \n  Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said that “one guiding principle for policy around these data centers and their effects on the economy is, there needs to be strong local input on the terms and conditions.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a general rule, my view is that the tech companies need to pay for the cost spillovers, particularly power and water,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But Auchincloss, like many lawmakers, said he wants to establish a balance between limiting costs and promoting development.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of granularity here, so I’m hesitant to announce one national point of view — it changes community by community, and policymakers should be humble about that,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/middleeast/israel-syria-deadly-incursion-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"07:15:00-05:00","title":"Israel’s deadly incursion in Syria a ‘war crime’ after 13 killed, Syrian FM says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 28, 2025, Israel launched a military incursion into the Beit Jinn village in southern Syria, targeting two members of the Lebanese Islamist militant group Jama’a Islamiya, allegedly planning attacks on Israel.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:33 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A visit to the  Louvre museum  in  Paris  is set to become significantly more expensive for travelers from outside Europe, with officials announcing plans to hike the price of tickets by 45%.\n \n\n   \n  From January 14, 2026, an individual ticket for visitors from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) — a grouping of nations that comprises the European Union member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway — will cost 32 euros ($37), a spokesperson for the Louvre told CNN on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Those visiting as part of a group with a guide will have to pay 28 euros ($32.40) per person.\n \n\n   \n  The price increases are expected to bring in an extra 15-20 million euros (around $17-23 million) a year, which will be invested in “modernising and upgrading the Louvre to address structural issues facing the museum,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Built from the late 12th century onwards, the Louvre Palace was the official residence of the kings of France for centuries. Louis XIV’s decision to move his court to Versailles, on the outskirts of the French capital, allowed for the establishment of the Louvre Museum in 1793.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, it has become the most visited museum in the world and a cultural highlight of any stay in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French.\n \n\n   \n  But the large crowds coming through the museum’s doors each day have put a strain on the centuries-old building — and its staff.\n \n\n   \n  Other issues include inadequate security measures, which were exposed in spectacular fashion on October 19 by an audacious daytime robbery in which four men stole priceless historic jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  These shortcomings were described in a report released by a French court on November 6, which slammed the Louvre’s leadership for its focus on headline-grabbing purchases and renovation projects over maintaining the security of one of the world’s largest museums.\n \n\n   \n  Pierre Moscovici, president of the Court of Accounts, which authored the report, told journalists that the robbery was a “deafening alarm signal” for the museum.\n \n\n   \n  However, the plan to introduce higher ticket prices for non-EEA visitors pre-dates the heist, as it was announced by French culture minister Rachida Dati at the beginning of this year.   \n \n\n   \n  Similar measures will also apply at other attractions, such as the Palace of Versailles, the Sainte Chapelle in Paris and the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley, according to the spokesperson.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/sport/football-ncaa-lane-kiffin-future","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-05:00","title":"Lane Kiffin’s Coaching Decision: The College Football Spectacle Continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lane Kiffin, the controversial and frequently dismissed college football coach, is once again at the center of national attention as three SEC schools—Ole Miss, LSU, and Florida—compete to hire him.

The latest drama unfolds this weekend \n       \n  Analysis by Dana O’Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:52 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   ESPN  analyst Paul Finebaum once compared him to Miley Cyrus and the late  Oakland Raiders  owner Al Davis called him a “flat-out liar.’’\n \n\n   \n  Tennessee students torched T-shirts and mattresses after he left for USC.\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, clever USC students graffitied the word “Kiffin” beneath every no parking “Fire Lane” marking on campus. Five games into the 2013 season, the school’s athletic director obliged, firing Lane Kiffin at 3 a.m. in the infamous dismissal known as the “tarmac firing.”\n \n\n   \n  And now here we are, a dozen years later, and three SEC schools with claims to 10 national championships among them all are anxiously awaiting to learn which of them will earn the right to pay Kiffin an  obscene amount of money  to coach its football team.\n \n\n   \n  Forget  turkey and stuffing , you can’t get more Americana than this – an improbable, if not exactly plucky, comeback story mixed into a reality show starring a savvy social-media-influencing family, playing out like an old-fashioned “Sophie’s Choice” soap opera and all of it neatly wrapped up in the purely American pastime of the pigskin.\n \n\n   \n  Not since a local TV station trained a camera on the back door of John Calipari’s Memphis office, trying to see if the coach was literally leaving for Kentucky, has a coach inspired such melodrama.\n \n\n   \n  WWLD (What will Lane do)? Will he choose desperate  LSU , whose governor reportedly has endorsed multi-million-dollar investments in both Kiffin’s contract and the Tigers’ NIL? Does it matter that his son, Knox, wore LSU headphones to his high school playoff football game and that his daughter, Landry, dates an LSU linebacker?\n \n\n   \n  Or will he opt for  Florida , which is seeking its eighth (if you count the two-game careers each for DJ Durkin and Greg Knox) coach in the last 15 years in its unrequited effort to rekindle the Urban Meyer years? Kiffin’s now-reunited wife, Layla, went to school there. Will that give Gainesville the relocation package edge?\n \n\n   \n  Or will he stay put at Ole Miss, where he has led the Rebels to their best season in more than six decades? Or will Ole Miss get jilted, bailed on before their savior coach can take them to the  College Football Playoff  altar?\n \n\n   \n  The Decision (apologies to  LeBron James ) is expected to come on Saturday, after Ole Miss either secures its spot in the playoff or gets egg all over its face and loses the Egg Bowl to Mississippi State. How the decision will be shared – news conference, press release, Instagram reel of a papal-like puff of smoke in branded school colors spewing from the chimney of the Kiffin family manse – remains to be seen.\n \n\n   \n  Yet What Lane Will ( Actually ) Do is almost secondary to the tempest he’s created to get here. He is the perfect coach for this moment of college athletics excess and absurdity, inexplicably the most desirable coach in all of  college football  despite a career pockmarked by epic failures.\n \n\n   \n  And rather than act as the Serious-Minded Football Coach and Leader of Men who would never do anything to distract from the very serious business of football, Kiffin is leaning into the mayhem, as if he’s in on the joke.\n \n\n   \n  The Serious-Minded Coach would hide behind the cloak of plausible deniability and let his agent do the dirty work before skulking out of town to his next gig. Kiffin? He’s posting pictures of meditative readings to his X account: “ Day 228 how do you figure out what you really want? ” reads the start of one passage of a book he has open.\n \n\n   \n     The lure of Lane \n \n\n   \n  If you are not in the throes of the hysteria, this is, in fact, quite hysterical.\n \n\n   \n  Consider the career arc of Lane Monte Kiffin, son of esteemed  and very serious-minded  defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin. His father was considered one of the game’s best defensive minds. He got his first shot at a head-coaching gig at NC State. After three seasons with no bowl games, he was fired and never got another head job.\n \n\n   \n  His son? No one, it seems, can avoid the lure of Lane.\n \n\n   \n  Davis fell under his spell first. The colorful Raiders owner tabbed the then-31-year-old Kiffin as the Raiders head coach in 2007, reminding everyone that the brilliant John Madden – who led the franchise to the Super Bowl XI title – was only 32 when he started in Oakland (Davis was just 33 when he coached the team in 1963).\n \n\n   \n  “We will come back. And Lane Kiffin will lead us back,’’ Davis vowed.\n \n\n   \n  Twenty games later, Davis got out an overhead projector in order to specify exactly how Kiffin had failed him, concluding, “I think he conned me like he conned all you people,’’ he said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite being dismissed in that blaze of unglory on September 30, 2008, Kiffin had another head coaching job and a raise within two months. The University of Tennessee hired him to replace Phil Fulmer, at $2.375 million a year, a bump from the $2 million Davis paid him.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll eventually win a lot here,’’ Kiffin promised, “but I can’t tell you when that will be.’’\n \n\n   \n  Eventually never happened. Kiffin stiff-armed the Volunteers 14 months later, having won as many games (seven) as recruiting violations incurred. Angry students torched mattresses and tried to bumrush the room where Kiffin read a statement about his decision to leave. Campus police drove him home in a cruiser for protection.\n \n\n   \n  Asked to describe Kiffin’s tenure, athletic director Mike Hamilton said: “Brief.’’\n \n\n   \n  Kiffin took over a USC team under serious NCAA penalties and within two seasons led the Trojans to a 10-2 record. The next season, USC debuted at No. 1 in the nation. The Trojans finished 7-6 and, five games into the 2013   season, Kiffin’s athletic director met him after a dismal 62-41 loss to Arizona and handed Kiffin his pink slip. Kiffin  has since said  he wasn’t actually left on the tarmac all those years ago – as it was portrayed back then and stuck in college football lore since – but he was indeed fired at the airport in the overnight hours.\n \n\n   \n  All of which prompted Finebaum to opine on SportsCenter, “How did someone like Lane Kiffin ever get these jobs? In some respects, Lane Kiffin is the Miley Cyrus of college football. He has very little talent, but we simply can’t take our eyes off him.’’\n \n\n   \n     The long road back \n \n\n   \n  The Icarus of college football, Kiffin crash-landed at Alabama, hired by Nick Saban as his offensive coordinator. It was the equivalent of a pigskin cleansing.\n \n\n   \n  Given the reins of Saban’s thoroughbred, Kiffin won a national title, championed a Heisman Trophy winner (Derrick Henry) and drove his boss crazy at times with his playcalling. Saban is the Exhibit A of a Serious-Minded Football Coach and he and his OC did not always see eye to eye.\n \n\n   \n  Saban memorably chewed out Kiffin in a game against Western Kentucky, explaining later, “There are no arguments. Those are called ass-chewings.’’\n \n\n   \n  Given a reboot to his head-coaching career, Kiffin grabbed it, accepting a job at Florida Atlantic. Though he vowed to finish the season in Tuscaloosa, where the Tide was playing in the national championship, he was given the “don’t let the door hit you” from Saban.\n \n\n   \n  Worried about his coordinator paying more attention to his new job than his old one, Saban tabbed Steve Sarkisian his new offensive assistant a week before the title game, and Kiffin left for the state of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  After three successful and largely mundane years at Florida Atlantic, Kiffin arrived in Oxford, where the football team could never quite match the fandom’s fervor.\n \n\n   \n  And finally, Kiffin did it. He delivered.\n \n\n   \n  The Rebels are in the middle of a historic season – ranked seventh in the nation, with only that game against Mississippi State standing between them and postseason glory.\n \n\n   \n  This should be his moment. He should be like Miley Cyrus: dancing and strutting off stage with a Grammy hoisted above her head.\n \n\n   \n  Instead Bet Online not only has odds on the Egg Bowl, where Ole Miss is favored by 7.5; it has odds on where Kiffin will coach next, where the Rebels are not, in fact, favored. LSU is.\n \n\n   \n  Because this is Lane Kiffin.\n \n\n   \n  We still can’t take our eyes off of him.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/sport/olympics-2026-cortina-ticket-sales-cap-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"06:38:00-05:00","title":"Transport fears force cap on ticket sales for events in Italy’s Cortina ahead of Winter Olympics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahead of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, transport challenges in Cortina d’Ampezzo have led organizers to cap ticket sales, reducing initial estimates by 15% to prevent congestion.

\n        6:38 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Local organizers have been forced to cap the number of tickets on sale for  Winter Olympics  events in  Cortina d’Ampezzo  in February because of concerns over transport congestion, heightened by delays in building a new cable car to take fans up the mountain.\n \n\n   \n  The issues facing the Apollonio-Socrepes gondola are the most pressing sign of the transport challenges that Italy faces as it stages a Games co-hosted by Cortina, and the city of Milan, with events spread across other parts of northern Italy.\n \n\n   \n  With the Games a little over two months away, work is well behind schedule on building the cable car link to carry thousands of spectators from the town center to the Tofane Alpine Skiing center where the women’s races are being held.\n \n\n   \n    Cap on ticket numbers\n \n\n   \n  In the town itself, Cortina will host curling, as well as  bobsled , luge and skeleton in the new sliding center.\n \n\n   \n  Massimo Bortoluzzi, provincial transport councillor, said uncertainty over the cable car project and delays in preparing the collection points for spectators heading to the events have prompted a preliminary 15% cut in initial spectator estimates of 200,000.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to draw a line, we’ve come too close to the deadline and now risk problems finding drivers and shuttles,” Bortoluzzi told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers have temporarily restricted the number of tickets available for events in Cortina to match the transport system’s current capacity and to avoid excessive traffic, a spokesperson for the Milano Cortina 2026 Foundation, the local organizing committee said, without providing precise figures.\n \n\n   \n    Traffic to be limited during Games\n \n\n   \n  Set in the Dolomites, Cortina is one of Italy’s best known winter resorts and staged the Games in 1956, but it has no rail station and access by the

Ancient DNA shakes up their origin story \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:30 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The origins of domestic cats — centuries before they conquered the world’s sofas and internet memes — have long been murky. Now, ancient DNA is helping to fill in the blanks, and the findings shake up the traditional story.\n \n\n   \n  Archaeologists had thought that cats and humans began living with one another around 9,500 years ago in  the Levant , which today includes parts of the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, at the beginning of the Neolithic era when humans started growing crops.\n \n\n   \n  Stores of grain attracted rodents, which in turn enticed wildcats, and humans found it useful to keep those mouse catchers around, leading to the cats’ eventual domestication. The oldest known cat remains in the archaeological record date from  a burial in Cyprus  from that time period.\n \n\n   \n  However, new analysis of genetic information recovered from cat skeletal remains at archaeological sites across Europe, the Middle East and Asia suggests that the domestic cats familiar today have far more recent origins and were not the first felines to live alongside humans.\n \n\n   \n  “We started to interrogate the bones that are ascribed to domestic cats that go back to 10,000 years and find which actually have the same genomes as the modern cat population that now dominates,” said Greger Larson, a professor in the school of archaeology at England’s University of Oxford. Larson coauthored two papers resulting from the research that published Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “It then completely undermines that narrative,” Larson said.\n \n\n   \n   A Europe-focused study  published in the journal Science examined 87 ancient and modern cat genomes and found that the domestic cat, which has the scientific name Felis catus, originated in North Africa, rather than the Levant as previously thought. Its ancestors were closely related to the African wildcat, or Felis lybica lybica.\n \n\n   \n  The cats established the gene pool of the modern domestic cat and appeared to spread around Europe with the rise of the Roman Empire about 2,000 years ago, the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  By the year 730, the domestic cat had arrived in China, likely hitching a ride in trading caravans along the  Silk Road , according to a second study published in  the journal Cell Genomics . It analyzed DNA from 22 felid bones unearthed in China over the past 5,000 years.\n \n\n   \n  Before then, an entirely different species of feline unrelated to the domestic cat or its ancestor lived alongside humans from at least 5,400 years ago until AD 150, the researchers discovered. Known scientifically as Prionailurus bengalensis, or the leopard cat, its remains — found previously at seven archaeological sites in China — were identified in the new analysis.\n \n\n   \n    Hidden neighbors\n \n\n   \n  Native to Asia, Prionailurus bengalensis is a small wildcat that does not naturally interbreed with Felis species. But beginning in the 1980s, modern cat breeders interbred the two to produce the Bengal cat, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The leopard cat’s relationship with humans was historically “commensal” — the two benefited from one another — but it never became fully domesticated despite living alongside people for more than 3,500 years, said Shu-jin Luo, a senior author of the China-focused study and a researcher at Peking University’s School of Life Sciences in Beijing. People benefited from the wild felines’ mouse-catching skills, while the cats had a ready supply of rodents to eat — but there was likely never any deliberate control over the leopard cat population.\n \n\n   \n  “The human-leopard cat commensal relationship eventually ended, and leopard cats returned to their natural habitats, living today as our elusive and hidden neighbors,” Luo said.\n \n\n   \n  One hypothesis for why the leopard cat never ended up fully domesticated stems from its reputation for preying on chickens as well as rodents, unlike domestic cats that are better at catching mice. In Chinese folklore, the leopard cat is known as the “chicken-catching tiger,” a reference to its appetite for poultry, Luo explained.\n \n\n   \n  “After the  Han Dynasty , the rise and change in poultry farming practices — from free ranging to cage-based systems — likely escalated human–leopard cat conflict,” Luo said via email. “Their strong tendency to prey on chickens, and to overkill in confined spaces, would have made leopard cats increasingly unwelcome around human settlements.”\n \n\n   \n  The disappearance of leopard cats from human settlements coincided with the turbulent centuries between the fall of China’s Han dynasty in AD 220 and the rise of the Tang dynasty in AD 618, when a colder, drier period reduced agricultural output, disrupting the leopard cat’s niche, Luo said.\n \n\n   \n  “This does not imply that leopard cats went extinct; rather, they simply retreated from human settlements and continued to persist in their natural forest habitats,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  The new environments that emerged in agricultural communities such as China meant changing relationships with lots of different animals, including wildcats, said William Taylor, assistant professor and curator of archaeology at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, who studies the domestication of animals. He wasn’t involved in the research.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s very cool to see these DNA studies help trace how the story of cats of Europe and Asia — this ubiquitous little critter that many folks take for granted — takes us back to the first trade routes like the Silk Roads that were built on travel by animals like horse, donkey, and camel.”\n \n\n   \n    Cats and ancient Egypt\n \n\n   \n  The﻿ new findings that trace the origins of the domestic cat to North Africa are perhaps not surprising, said Jonathan Losos, a professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n \n\n   \n  Cats play an important role in the iconography of ancient Egypt, he noted in a  commentary  published alongside the Science study. Tomb walls depict cats as family members wearing collars, earrings and necklaces; eating from dishes; and sitting under chairs.\n \n\n   \n  However, it isn’t clear whether the land of the pharaohs was where the entire domestication process occurred, or if it was simply the finishing school where mice catchers became household companions, Losos wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The Europe-focused study found that the cats at archaeological sites earlier than 200 BC were genetically identifiable as European wildcats   of the species Felis silvestris, not domestic cats, even though their skeletons were difficult to tell apart. It is still possible that the wildcats lived among humans, Losos noted, as kittens of wildcat species can be relatively easily tamed.\n \n\n   \n  The work to untangle the history of cats is ongoing, and Losos noted a lack of archaeological samples from North Africa and southwest Asia means the domestic cat’s origin story is far from complete.\n \n\n   \n  “Ever sphinx-like, cats give up their secrets grudgingly,” he added. “Yet more ancient DNA is needed to unravel these mysteries of long ago.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/politics/us-reexamining-green-card-holders-19-countries","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"08:13:00-05:00","title":"US to Reexamine Green Cards from 19 Countries Amid Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, has announced a full-scale reexamination of green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries deemed 'of concern,' including Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and others, following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal.

countries “of concern” at President Donald Trump’s direction, as the Trump administration intensifies its immigration crackdown following the  shooting of two National Guard members  in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” Joe Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, wrote in a  post on X  Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for additional details, including which countries are considered to be “of concern,” USCIS pointed CNN to 19 countries listed in a  June presidential proclamation .\n \n\n   \n  The 19 countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  USCIS said in a statement later Thursday that when vetting immigrants from those 19 countries, the agency will now take into consideration “negative, country specific factors,” which includes whether the country is able “to issue secure identity documents.”\n \n\n   \n  Since officials last night identified the suspect of the shooting as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, the Trump administration has ramped up its efforts to restrict immigration.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said Thursday the administration is also reviewing all asylum cases that were approved under former President Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  “Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN, adding, “The Trump Administration is also reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in  a social media post  Thursday night his administration will work to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear which countries Trump was referring to. “Third world countries,” used by some to define developing nations, has repeatedly been used by Trump as part of his anti-immigration rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out the State Department and the White House for clarity.\n \n\n   \n  Trump wrote in the post that his administration will also, “terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump added that he would end all federal benefits and subsidies to “noncitizens” and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.”\n \n\n   \n  Lakanwal — who previously worked with the US government, including the CIA — came to the country in 2021 as part of Biden’s  “Operation Allies Welcome”  after assisting the US in Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024, and the Trump administration granted it in April 2025, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  The Alliance of Afghan Communities in the United States on Thursday condemned the shooting, while also expressing concerns over the impact of Lakanwal’s actions on the immigration process for other Afghan nationals.\n \n\n   \n  “A single individual’s crime must not jeopardize or obstruct the legal cases of thousands of deserving Afghans who meet all U.S. legal requirements,” the alliance said in a statement, which called for federal agencies to process Afghan immigrants as usual, without delays or suspensions.\n \n\n   \n  More than 190,000 Afghans have resettled in the United States since the US military withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021, according to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  In a video address from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida late Wednesday, Trump blamed the Biden administration for bringing the alleged shooter to the US and argued the attack “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in the remarks, “We must now reexamine every single alien who’s entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also lamented what he described as “20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners” who entered the US during his predecessor’s administration, casting it “a risk to our very survival.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration’s latest move to reexamine green cards is in line with Trump’s  anti-immigration rhetoric . A green card is a document that deems its holder as a lawful permanent resident of the US. It differs from refugee and asylum programs — which the Trump administration has already sought to limit — though refugees must apply for a green card after one year of being in the US.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/economy/us-tariffs-italian-pasta","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Your Favorite Pasta Could Soon Get a Lot More Expensive.

Here’s why \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Greg Bettinelli discovered Pasta Rummo on his honeymoon in Florence in 2002, at a time when the brand was nearly impossible to find in the United States. He and his wife stuffed their suitcases with as much of it as they could carry.\n \n\n   \n  These days, the Italian pasta brand can be bought from major retailers like Target and Whole Foods. Still, Bettinelli is stocking up again, fearing his favorite pasta brand will disappear from American shelves or skyrocket in price when tariffs of more than 100% are set to take effect on over a dozen Italian pasta makers next year.\n \n\n   \n  Bettinelli’s fears aren’t unjustified.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of  grocery staples have gotten pricier  this year due to inflation and the Trump administration’s significant tariffs. Even as President Donald Trump moved earlier this month to  cut tariffs on some foods  to ease costs, they still could chip away at a budget-friendly meal option: a plate of pasta.\n \n\n   \n  If the tariffs go into effect, pasta shipments from the impacted Italian companies would be “virtually wiped out,” warned Coldiretti, the largest farming association in Italy, in a  statement  translated from Italian. The 13   companies collectively represent 16% of Italian pasta exports to the United States, according to the US Commerce Department.\n \n\n   \n  But if Italian pasta is hit with 107% tariffs, as the Trump administration plans, the fewer options Americans have left could be even more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no way we can absorb (the tariffs) in our price structure,” said Claudio Constantini, general manager at Pastificio Sgambaro, one of the 13 Italian companies facing tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Constantini said Sgambaro will try to maintain exports to the US, for now. “But if the picture does not change, it will not work for long,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sgambaro, a family-owned company, mostly sells its products in smaller Italian grocers in the United States. But it had hoped to expand in 2026. Constantini said those plans are now in limbo.\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like you were eating outside in Tuscany, but it’s just a $4 pasta,” Bettinelli said of Italian-made pasta. “It was an affordable luxury. Why can’t we have nice things?”\n \n\n   \n    Why are the pasta tariffs so high?\n \n\n   \n  The potential pasta tariffs stem from an antidumping complaint two American companies filed with the US Commerce Department last July. In the complaint, two Midwestern companies, 8th Avenue Food & Provisions and Winland Foods alleged that several Italian companies underpriced pasta that was shipped to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Winland Foods, which owns 16 different pasta brands, declined to comment; 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns Ronzoni, didn’t respond to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The complaint prompted  an investigation  led by the Commerce Department, which began by requesting documentation from two of the 13 Italian companies that were being examined: La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo. The two accounted for the largest volume of pasta sales to the United States, according to the department.\n \n\n   \n  The preliminary investigation published by the Commerce Department in September stated that the two companies made sales to the United States “at less than normal value.” It also said both were “uncooperative” during the investigation and provided “incomplete and unreliable” data. (Neither company responded to CNN’s request for comment.)\n \n\n   \n  Because of that, the Commerce Department applied what’s known as an “adverse facts available” antidumping tariff rate, which is essentially based on assumptions about a business under investigation when there isn’t sufficient documentation. In this case, the department decided on a 91% tariff, which would be stacked on top of the current 15% tariff on goods from the European Union, bringing the total rate to 107%.\n \n\n   \n  The actual tariff rate is subject to change depending on the Commerce Department’s final review, which is slated to wrap up on February 18 with a possible extension of up to 60 days, a department official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the European Commission  reportedly  pushed the Trump administration in meetings earlier this week to reconsider pasta tariffs, along with tariffs on other goods from the European Union, according to Politico.\n \n\n   \n    Mounting affordability concerns\n \n\n   \n  The steep tariffs that could soon hit many Italian pasta brands come as the Trump administration faces  mounting pressure  from voters to address affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Grocery staples, including beef and coffee, have gotten pricier since Trump instituted blanket tariffs on nearly every country’s imports in April. Then this month, the administration rolled back many tariffs on food and agricultural imports, an effort  seen as an attempt  to improve affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the impending pasta duties may not be tied directly to Trump, despite his  disdain  for many of the European Union’s trade and business practices.\n \n\n   \n  The president “generally does not get involved” in antidumping investigations, said Thomas Beline, a trade attorney and partner at Cassidy Levy Kent, who previously worked at the Commerce Department and was involved in Italian pasta antidumping investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, Italian pasta antidumping investigations are hardly new; the Commerce Department initiated such inspections nearly 30 years ago under President Bill Clinton.\n \n\n   \n  Blame aside, with many Italian pastas on the cusp of potentially becoming pricier, some enthusiasts are already searching for workarounds.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Costanza Genoese Zerbi, a Long Beach, California, real estate agent, urged her social media followers to make their own pasta as a way to enjoy a higher-quality plate at a more affordable price. On Sunday, she even hosted a pasta-making party for women in her community.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the people who are going to be hurt the most from this are Americans,” Zerbi, who moved to the United States from Italy as a child, said of pasta tariffs. “If you don’t have the richness of foods from all over the world, whether it’s Italy or France or Mexico or Canada, it’s a very sad world.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/sport/football-nfl-week-13-thanksgiving-day","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"05:12:00-04:00","title":"Burrow leads Bengals to win in return, Cowboys outlast Chiefs and Love shines in Packers win: Thanksgiving NFL recap","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Thanksgiving Day, 2025, the NFL delivered a dramatic and emotionally charged weekend of games.

So, it was great to get this one, coming off a short week. This is a fun little moment with all these guys.”\n \n\n   \n  Burrow also commended everyone in his life including family and medical staff for getting him back on the field.\n \n\n   \n  The road doesn’t get much easier for the Bengals as they head to Buffalo to face reigning MVP Josh Allen and the  Bills  while the Ravens look to bounce back against another divisional opponent, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n \n\n   \n    Cowboys quell Mahomes’ magic\n \n\n   \n   Kansas City Chiefs  star quarterback Patrick Mahomes came into Thursday’s game with something to prove.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old has only played the  Dallas Cowboys  once in his nine-year career and never in his home state of Texas so the Thanksgiving showdown meant a little bit more.\n \n\n   \n  However, it was Dallas that outlasted the “Mahomes magic” in a 31-28 win at AT&T Stadium to spoil his homecoming.\n \n\n   \n  Cowboys QB Dak Prescott threw 27-of-39 for 320 yards, two touchdowns and a pick to help the five-time Super Bowl champs win their third straight game to improve to 6-5-1 on the season.\n \n\n   \n  Dallas has beaten the last two Super Bowl champions in recent weeks – the Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles – an achievement which led Prescott highlighted postgame.\n \n\n   \n  “On top of where we put ourselves right before these games and just the place that we’re in, having to get these wins against two elite teams,” Prescott said.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, two teams that played in the Super Bowl last year. Last year’s last year, but you’re talking about two organizations that obviously know how to win and we just beat them both in two great games.”\n \n\n   \n  Mahomes, who played college ball at Texas Tech, had an outstanding game, throwing 23-of-34 for 261 yards and four touchdowns in the loss.\n \n\n   \n  Dallas now heads to Detroit to play the Lions next Thursday while the Chiefs host the Houston Texans on December 7.\n \n\n   \n    For the Love of the game\n \n\n   \n  It hasn’t been the prettiest of seasons for 27-year-old  Jordan Love  and the Green Bay Packers, but the fifth-year quarterback saved his best game for Turkey Day.\n \n\n   \n  Love matched his career-high with four passing touchdowns to go with 234 yards through the air to lead the Packers to a 31-24 win over division rivals the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  The Pack, who improved to 8-3-1 on the season, have swept both games against Detroit this season to own a tiebreaker and currently sit in second place in the NFC North behind the Chicago Bears.\n \n\n   \n  It was the third loss in five games for the Lions, who sit outside the NFC playoff picture with a 7-5 record. Quarterback Jared Goff was 20-of-26 for 256 yards and two touchdowns, while star wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown left the game in the first quarter with an ankle injury.\n \n\n   \n  Green Bay hosts the Bears on December 7 while the Lions welcome the Cowboys to Ford Field next week.\n \n\n   \n  Football fans don’t have to wait long as the NFL plays on Black Friday with the Eagles facing Chicago at 3 p.m. ET at Lincoln Financial Field.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/us/ups-planes-grounded-crash-delivery-season-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"04:53:00-05:00","title":"Fleet of UPS planes grounded after deadly crash expected to miss peak delivery season","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a deadly crash on November 4, 2025, in Louisville, Kentucky, where a UPS McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo plane lost its left engine during takeoff, killing 14 and injuring 23, UPS grounded its entire MD-11 fleet.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:56 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Four times taller than the Hollywood sign and around seven times larger than the White House, Uzbekistan’s newest cultural center is a monument of epic proportions.\n \n\n   \n  Part museum, part academic research facility, the three-story, $150-million Center for Islamic Civilization (CISC) in Tashkent will be open to the public in March 2026, and is intended to celebrate and revive Uzbekistan’s historical role as a center of Islamic scholarship.\n \n\n   \n  “This region has been home to many ancestors who influenced world civilization,” said Firdavs Abdukhalikov, director of CISC. “The big question was how to present their influence to the world, to younger generations, in an engaging and modern way.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past eight years, while the building was under construction, CISC engaged 1,500 specialists from more than 40 countries to help develop the center’s scientific, architectural and cultural elements.\n \n\n   \n  For example, through an “interactive educational zone” that leverages virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence technologies for exhibits such as conversations with “living portraits” of historical scholars and thinkers, the center hopes to inspire children to explore astronomy, medicine, literature and art.\n \n\n   \n  The second floor will be dedicated to research, where international academics can access more than 200,000 books in its library.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not just a museum — it’s a cultural and educational platform. Here, we don’t only engage with artifacts, but also with the lives and ideas of influential figures,” Abdukhalikov added.\n \n\n   \n    Reviving the past\n \n\n   \n  While Uzbekistan is a secular nation, Islam is a key part of its history and cultural identity.\n \n\n   \n  Arab conquests brought Islam to Central Asia in the 7th century, replacing earlier Zoroastrian and Buddhist traditions, and between the 9th and 12th centuries, the region experienced a golden age of science, literature, and architecture.\n \n\n   \n  Medieval Uzbekistan, and the wider Central Asian region, was “a globalized world before globalization,” said historian  Farhan Ahmad Nizami , founding director of the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford, who’s not connected to the CISC.\n \n\n   \n  Uzbek cities like Bukhara and Samarkand were important stops on the Silk Road, a cross-continental trade route that stretched from Venice to Xi’an for 1,500 years (130 BCE to 1453 CE), and became a confluence of culture and ideas from both the East and West.\n \n\n   \n  “(Uzbekistan’s) contribution in science and arts is obvious, and now people are rediscovering it, although it had not received sufficient attention,” Nizami added.\n \n\n   \n  Later, in the 15 th  and 16 th  centuries, the  Timurid Empire  would see a second renaissance of art, science, and diplomacy, with  Samarkand  at its center, an era that the CISC’s architecture draws inspiration from with its grand, mosaic-covered archways, blue tile-covered domes and intricate ornamentation.\n \n\n   \n  In the 19th century, Russian expansion saw many parts of Central Asia incorporated into the Russian Empire, and later the Soviet Union, which imposed secular rule and suppressed Islamic practices.\n \n\n   \n  “A significant portion of our cultural treasures left the country during the Soviet times,” says Abdukhalikov.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until 1991 that Uzbekistan regained independence and began reviving its Islamic heritage and cultural identity. To this end, CISC was given a directive to recover its historic items.\n \n\n   \n  “We have participated in auctions such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s, bringing back parts of our cultural heritage. We have reclaimed 2,000 items and are continuing our work on this,” says Abdukhalikov.\n \n\n   \n  The center’s exhibitions explore Uzbekistan’s history through these objects, including the 7th-century Quran of Uthman, one of the oldest in the world, and a collection of 114 Quranic manuscripts created by renowned rulers and calligraphers across the ages.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Tremendous potential’\n \n\n   \n  While Nizami said the center has “tremendous potential,” he cautioned that “the building is a platform; what happens on the platform is entirely different,” stressing that its success depends on long-term research, education and cultural engagement.\n \n\n   \n  There are criticisms of the center, relating to its cost, the sources of its funding, and the  limited religious freedom  in the country.\n \n\n   \n  CISC declined to comment on the building’s cost or funding sources.\n \n\n   \n  A construction fire in September delayed the center’s original launch, but the main construction work has been completed.\n \n\n   \n  With around 60% of Uzbekistan’s population under the age of 35, Abdukhalikov said that the museum is for the next generation.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to inspire them and tell the story of our great history through innovation and creativity,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/health/measles-elimination-who-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"Measles cases are surging, making global elimination a ‘distant goal,’ WHO says","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Measles cases are surging globally, with a dramatic rise in outbreaks — nearly tripling since 2021 — threatening to undo decades of progress.

\nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For decades, measles vaccination has been a global success story. Deaths from measles dropped 88% around the world from 2000 to 2024, according to a new report from the World Health Organization, with an estimated 58 million lives saved in that time.\n \n\n   \n  But now, with vaccine coverage well below the level needed to stop transmission, cases are surging. Fifty-nine countries reported large or disruptive measles outbreaks last year, almost triple the number reported in 2021. A quarter of outbreaks are happening in countries previously declared measles-free, including  Canada and the United States .\n \n\n   \n  “Global measles elimination remains a distant goal,” according to the WHO report released Friday. The progress of the last decades is in peril with the return of outbreaks and decline in resources for immunization and disease surveillance, according to the report — in particular, the US government’s  reduced support  for global health.\n \n\n   \n  Elimination means a virus is no longer circulating and that a country has the capacity to “shut down” infections that come in via visitors and travelers. Canada  recently lost  its elimination status, and WHO is also concerned about the US backsliding and losing its status, said Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s Department of Immunization.\n \n\n   \n  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reports  that there have been 1,798 confirmed measles cases in the US this year, the highest number of cases since the country reached elimination status in  2000 .\n \n\n   \n  “Measles remains the world’s most contagious virus,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Even though there’s a highly effective low-cost vaccine, the disease “exploits gaps in immunization coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  Globally, more than 30 million children were under-protected against measles in 2024.\n \n\n   \n    Victories and challenges\n \n\n   \n  There have been some victories, officials say. Measles deaths have dropped sharply since 2000. Every WHO country and region has committed to eliminating measles and rubella by maintaining at least 95% vaccine coverage, strengthening surveillance systems and making measles elimination goals part of broader health care efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Recently, Cabo Verde, Seychelles and Mauritius became the first countries in the African region to achieve measles elimination this year. Twenty-one Pacific island countries also eliminated measles and rubella this year.\n \n\n   \n  “We have made measurable progress towards measles elimination,” said Diana Chang Blanc, unit head of WHO’s Essential Program on Immunization. But progress toward elimination is “still too slow. Cases and deaths are still unacceptably high.” Every measles death is preventable with a low-cost vaccine.\n \n\n   \n  Three countries have yet to give the second dose of a measles vaccine as standard practice. That’s important, Chang Blanc said, because the second dose “increases vaccine effectiveness to 95%, providing most individuals with long-lasting immunity.”\n \n\n   \n     In 2024, only 84% of children received the first dose and 76% received the second dose globally. “This means that 30 million children remain underprotected from measles in 2024,” Chang Blanc said. “Children living in fragile, vulnerable conflict-afflicted settings are the most adversely affected.”\n \n\n   \n  Progress is not happening at the expected pace, she said, because of lower global immunization rates and backsliding of vaccination since the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been challenging for children who missed recommended vaccines during the pandemic to catch up.\n \n\n   \n  Measles acts as a “fire alarm for immunization programs,” O’Brien said. When the disease resurfaces, “it warns that there are gaps in immunization coverage” and health care access inequities. That same gap persist with other vaccine-preventable diseases, too, like whooping cough and polio.\n \n\n   \n    Slowing progress to elimination\n \n\n   \n  The alarm has already been sounding on vaccines. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted immunization program around the world. Measles vaccination levels are still slightly below pre-pandemic levels.\n \n\n   \n  Misinformation and disinformation are notable factors in slowed vaccination rates, WHO says. But access is still the most significant problem.\n \n\n   \n  Chang Blanc said that the breakdown or lack of “a strong foundation in the routine immunization system” is the No. 1 reason for high measles case counts and outbreaks.\n \n\n   \n  Although it sounds simple, Chang Blanc said, those routine systems require trained health workforces, logistic systems, transport, surveillance systems and other resources that many countries do not have.\n \n\n   \n  The major barrier to reaching 95% measles vaccine coverage is “access to populations that need it most,” Chang Blanc said.\n \n\n   \n  Deep funding cuts aﬀecting the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network, which include 760 laboratories that help surveil and respond to outbreaks, and country immunization programs are “feared to widen immunity gaps and drive further outbreaks in the coming year,” the report says.\n \n\n   \n  “Securing sustainable domestic financing and new partners is now a critical challenge to advancing eﬀorts toward a world free of measles,” the report says.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/science/russia-space-launch-pad-damaged-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"12:51:00-05:00","title":"Launch pad damaged as Russian rocket blasts off for space station, agency says","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A launch pad at Russia’s Baikonur Cosmodrome sustained damage during the launch of Soyuz MS-28, which successfully transported two Russians and one American to the International Space Station.

that a US plan to end the war in Ukraine could “form the basis for future agreements” but renewed threats to seize more territory by force unless Kyiv withdraws.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters in Bishkek, in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan on Thursday, Putin confirmed the Kremlin was expecting a US delegation headed by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to visit Moscow early next week, adding that the Kremlin was ready for “serious discussion”.\n \n\n   \n  But chances of a swift breakthrough appear slim after Putin repeated his maximalist demands, saying the war in Ukraine will only end “once Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy.”\n \n\n   \n  “If they don’t withdraw, we will achieve this through military means,” the Russian leader said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his delegation will also meet with US officials by the end of this week to discuss points set out in Geneva. Speaking in his nightly video address, Zelensky added that next week will see “important negotiations not only for our delegation, but also for me personally,” without providing further details.\n \n\n   \n  Russia is occupying some 20% of the territory recognized under international law as part of sovereign Ukraine, including almost all of the Luhansk region, and parts of the Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n \n\n   \n  Moscow is demanding Ukraine surrender the entirety of these four regions, which it has annexed but not fully conquered.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has made some gains along the eastern Ukrainian frontline in recent weeks, most significantly around the  city of Pokrovsk .\n \n\n   \n  Still, the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said on Thursday that data on Russian forces’ rate of advance indicates that “a Russian military victory in Ukraine is not inevitable, and a rapid Russian seizure of the rest of Donetsk Oblast is not imminent.”\n \n\n   \n  Crucially, the area Russia is demanding includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen that are seen as vital for Ukrainian security. Kyiv and its European allies have made it clear that territorial concessions are a red line for them.\n \n\n   \n  Putin’s remarks on Thursday were the strongest indication that Russia is not willing to move after US  officials , including Trump himself, touted “tremendous progress” being made on their efforts to end the war.\n \n\n   \n  This came after Ukrainian and European officials strongly opposed and then revised the  28-point peace plan  which was drafted by the US with apparent strong input from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The original plan reflected Russia’s extensive wishlist, and included a demand for Ukraine to reduce its army and be barred from joining NATO.\n \n\n   \n  Putin said on Thursday that he was expecting  Witkoff  to arrive to Moscow early next week, presumably to discuss the new draft of the plan, the exact wording of which is not yet known.\n \n\n   \n  Putin said he has been informed of the latest discussions and that the plan could “form the basis for future agreements.”\n \n\n   \n  “It would be impolite of me to speak of final agreements now,” Putin added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/asia/hong-kong-fire-survivors-questions-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"03:37:00-04:00","title":"Hong Kong’s Deadliest Fire in Decades: Survivors Ask How It Was Allowed to Happen","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hong Kong suffered its deadliest fire in decades at the Wang Fuk Court public housing complex, where a fire rapidly spread through eight buildings under renovation, fueled by flammable bamboo scaffolding and polystyrene materials.

Survivors are asking how it was allowed to happen \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:37 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For half an hour as the fire grew and swallowed an adjacent building, Wan watched television in his home, unaware of the danger blazing his way. Even when he heard a commotion outside and sirens wailing in the distance, he brushed it aside as a typically loud afternoon in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  It was only when he heard people screaming for help that he got up to look out the window of his eighth-floor apartment. “The instant I opened the window, I saw the smoke,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  By then, it was 3:15 p.m. on Wednesday – 30 minutes after an eyewitness first noticed a  blaze intensifying  in one of eight residential towers making up the Wang Fuk Court public housing complex.\n \n\n   \n  Firefighters had arrived on the scene, but the fire had already spread to other tower blocks, which were all under renovation and covered in  bamboo scaffolding , a traditional construction material. Burnt poles were collapsing off the exteriors as flames raced up the 32-storey high-rises.\n \n\n   \n  Wan, who CNN is identifying by his surname, grabbed his two dogs and his wallet, and fled down an emergency stairwell that smelled of gas. Just minutes after his evacuation, the fire was declared a Level 4 – the second-highest on a five-tier alarm ranking.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the next few hours, horrified onlookers watched as the complex – home to more than 4,000 people, many of them elderly – rapidly became engulfed in flames. People returning home from work and school stood with their briefcases and backpacks, staring at the flickering orange as daylight faded.\n \n\n   \n  By nightfall, the scale of the devastation was becoming clear. Around 6 p.m. the fire was declared a maximum level 5 alarm. Community chat groups lit up as families desperately checked the whereabouts of loved ones. News channels broadcast images that sent shock waves through Hong Kong, a wealthy city with a strong track record on building safety.\n \n\n   \n  As stunned residents grappled with the sheer speed of the fire’s spread – engulfing seven of the complex’s eight buildings within a matter of hours – they raised critical questions about whether this disaster could have been prevented, pointing to concerns over construction safety, silent fire alarms, and a pricey renovation project.\n \n\n   \n  Three arrests have been made so far, with criminal and anticorruption probes launched as the government faces mounting public pressure to answer questions.\n \n\n   \n  After spending the night at an emergency shelter, Wan and his wife were among hundreds of residents waiting desperately for news.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no home to go back to,” he told CNN from the sports center that had been converted into a shelter, as volunteers and staff walked around distributing food and drinks.\n \n\n   \n  “We have nothing, not even clothes.”\n \n\n   \n    Questions and probes\n \n\n   \n  At least 128 people are known to have died in the blaze, the deadliest in decades in the city of some 7.5 million. Many others still remain unaccounted for and the toll is expected to rise as the grim task of searching through charred apartments continues.\n \n\n   \n  As residents endure an agonizing wait for news, some say there were early warning signs and pleas for action.\n \n\n   \n  A Facebook group that describes itself as a community forum for Wang Fuk Court residents shows they had raised concerns about the construction netting material as early as last October – more than a year ago. Several posts include residents sharing what they said were complaints filed with the Labour Department about possible fire hazards; one post claimed the Labor Department issued a warning to contractors after surprise on-site inspections.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement sent to CNN the Labour Department said it had conducted 16 safety inspections at Wang Fuk Court between July 2024 and November 2025 “including reviewing whether the protective sheeting (commonly known as ‘scaffold netting’) installed on the Wang Fuk Court scaffolds had product certification meeting the Department’s requirements.”\n \n\n   \n  “The most recent inspection was conducted on November 20, after which the Department again issued a written reminder to the contractors on the necessity of taking appropriate fire prevention measures,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s code on bamboo scaffolding safety calls for all scaffold netting to be fire-retardant. That code is not a law – although non-compliance can carry consequences in any criminal proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has tried contacting the construction company involved through several associated email addresses and phone numbers, but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  Officials and police also say they suspect construction materials found at the apartments — including protective nets, canvas, and plastic covers — failed to meet safety standards. They also found polystyrene boards, a highly flammable material, blocking windows of multiple apartments – which Wan said he had noticed inside his building staircases before.\n \n\n   \n  Other residents voiced concerns to CNN about the speed of evacuations and the reliability of their fire alarms. On Wednesday night, one resident who declined to be named said no authorities came knocking to tell her to evacuate when the fire began at a nearby block.\n \n\n   \n  Another resident surnamed Au, aged 40, said his family had smelled fire and heard the sound of bamboo scaffolding burning and falling outside their walls – but their building alarm didn’t ring.\n \n\n   \n  The Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong’s statutory anti-graft body, announced on Thursday that it had set up a dedicated task force to investigate potential corruption linked to the renovations at Wang Fuk Court.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the city’s leader announced on Thursday that all housing estates undergoing significant renovations will be inspected for safety.\n \n\n   \n    Vulnerable residents\n \n\n   \n  The fire struck a neighborhood loved by many for its abundance of pedestrian streets, wide bike paths and nearby hiking trails.\n \n\n   \n  Wang Fuk Court is part of government public housing – a program that aims to rent or sell affordable housing to low-income families at a steep discount.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong is routinely ranked one of the world’s most expensive property markets, where a tiny apartment far from the city center can still eat up half of a monthly salary – making these public housing units deeply desirable.

last Black Friday? \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sears, once America’s largest and most important retailer, could very be going into its last Christmas shopping season.\n \n\n   \n  The Sears chain had 2,000 stores as recently as 20 years ago and more than 200 stores when it emerged from bankruptcy in 2019. Now it has just five, after three more closings this past year.\n \n\n   \n  One standalone store in Coral Gables, Florida, could be torn down to build 1,000 housing units. Another four operate in malls – in Braintree, Massachusetts; Concord, California; El Paso, Texas; and Orlando Florida. All those malls are owned by Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall operator.\n \n\n   \n  The company, once the Walmart and Amazon of its day, helped change America, from how people shopped to where they lived and more. Now the once-proud chain is in a precarious position; by next year’s holiday season, it could finally be gone.\n \n\n   \n  Neither Simon nor Sears ownership responded to a request for comment, and the owner of the Florida property declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  The five remaining stores are unlikely to revive Sears, experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re phantoms in the night presently,” said Mark Cohen, a former Sears Canada executive who was formerly head of retail studies at Columbia University. “Someone unlocks the door in the morning and locks it at night, but there’s actually nothing to sell in the stores.”\n \n\n   \n    Sears’ death spiral\n \n\n   \n  There is no chance the remaining stores are profitable, said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail for research firm GlobalData.\n \n\n   \n  “Sears wasn’t profitable back in the day when it was a much bigger company with buying power,” he said. “The idea it is profitable with just a small number of stores is for the birds.”\n \n\n   \n  Saunders and Cohen both said it’s also possible that Sears’ owner Eddie Lampert is simply keeping the remaining stores open to book accounting losses for tax purposes.\n \n\n   \n  Alternatively, store leases might be hard (and costly) to break, or maybe another real estate issue at play, Saunders said.\n \n\n   \n  Neither Saunders nor Cohen see a future for the store.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re in retail and you’re trying to sell something nobody wants to buy anymore, like electric typewriters or video tapes, you’re in a world of hurt,” said Cohen ,  who blames Lampert for the store’s current state. “But customers didn’t stop buying circular saws or screwdrivers and hammers or appliances. If you’re in retail and you sell things people want to buy, your success or failure is entirely based upon what kind of skill you bring to the table. He had none.”\n \n\n   \n  Lampert, a hedge fund operator, bought the company in 2005 and merged it with Kmart, only to oversee its spiral into bankruptcy in 2018. He then bought the remains of the company once more out of bankruptcy early the following year with promises to turn it around.\n \n\n   \n    How Sears changed America\n \n\n   \n  Sears was created when founder Richard Sears, a railroad station agent, started selling watches as a side business in 1886. He and watchmaker partner Alvah Roebuck incorporated the company as Sears Roebuck in 1893. It grew to be not only the country’s largest retailer but also its biggest employer.\n \n\n   \n  Its groundbreaking catalog brought manufactured goods into homes of a mainly rural America in the early 20th century, ending the need for many to make their own clothing, furniture and other household items, and creating demands for goods produced in America’s growing factories and cities. It opened its first store in 1925 and soon was such a dominant retailer that many traditional mom-and-pop stores in downtowns across the country were forced out of business.\n \n\n   \n  It helped to bring items such as appliances and other labor-saving devices into American households, which helped women pursue jobs outside the home. When suburbs boomed after World War II, Sears became a key anchor in malls that helped give rise to many communities.\n \n\n   \n  By the 1990s, the company said that one out of seven Americans either worked for Sears or had once worked there – many of those jobs with health care and pension benefits.\n \n\n   \n  It created top-quality brands such as Kenmore appliances, Craftsman tools and Die-Hard batteries. It built what was then the world’s tallest building in Chicago to serve as its headquarters in the early 1970s. And it also branched into other fields, creating Allstate Insurance in 1931, and purchased both the Dean Witter brokerage firm and Coldwell Banker real estate firm in 1981. It teamed up with IBM to form Prodigy, one of the very first internet services, in 1984 and created the Discover credit card in 1985.\n \n\n   \n  The rise of discounters like Walmart ( WMT ) and big box stores like Home Depot ( HD ) hurt, as did the onset of online shopping. Sears management also failed to make the rest of its merchandise as popular as its appliances and power tools. It lost its 75-year-old place on the Dow Jones industrial average, a benchmark of some of the nation’s most important companies, to Home Depot in 1999.\n \n\n   \n    Sears’ final demise\n \n\n   \n  In 2005 Lampert, who had already bought Kmart out of bankruptcy, bought Sears and merged them into one company, Sears Holdings, with a combined 3,500 US stores and more than 300,000 employees. But both brands were already in a downward spiral.\n \n\n   \n  After the merger the company concentrated on selling off its more attractive real estate and  buying back stock  to prop up its declining share price, rather than investing in modernizing stores to make them competitive.\n \n\n   \n  But losses piled up, and by 2018 the company had filed for bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  The company that  emerged from bankruptcy  in early 2019 owned 223 Sears and 202 Kmart stores nationwide. But less than less than seven years later, it is barely on life support.\n \n\n   \n  The  last full-line Kmart store  in the mainland United States closed in Bridgehampton, New York a little more than a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Sears could soon be next, Cohen said. “There’s no future.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/style/robert-am-stern-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-05:00","title":"Robert A.M.

Previous research on Bennu samples had already found 14 of the 20 amino acids all living organisms on Earth stem from, as well as all five biological nucleobases — the components that make up the genetic code in DNA and RNA.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers also previously detected amino acids in samples from another asteroid,  Ryugu , which the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency collected in 2019, as well as in various meteorites that have fallen to Earth. This growing body of evidence suggests that asteroids might have delivered essential life ingredients to our planet early on, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new analysis of Bennu samples has confidently, although not yet conclusively, identified tryptophan, increasing the tally of protein-building amino acids in the asteroid to 15 out of 20.\n \n\n   \n  “Finding tryptophan in the Bennu asteroid is a big deal, because tryptophan is one of the more complex amino acids, and until now it had never been seen in any meteorite or space sample,” said José Aponte, an astrochemist in the Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. He coauthored a  study  on the findings that published Monday in the journal PNAS.\n \n\n   \n  The presence of tryptophan in an asteroid supports the idea that the recipe for life might not have begun only on Earth, Aponte added in an email: “Seeing it form naturally in space tells us that these ingredients were already being made out in the early Solar System. That would have made it easier for life to get started.”\n \n\n   \n    Jigsaw pieces\n \n\n   \n  Bennu, with a name that name refers to an ancient Egyptian deity associated with the sun, creation and rebirth, stretches about one-third of a mile wide. The space rock likely represents a chunk that broke off of a much larger asteroid sometime between 2 billion and 700 million years ago. It probably formed in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and its chemical composition reflects the beginnings of the solar system, dating back about 4.5 billion years,  according to NASA .\n \n\n   \n  The asteroid has been  orbiting close to Earth  for about 1.75 million years. Data has shown it could hit our planet in the year 2182, potentially leading to a “global winter.” Scientists currently estimate the  odds of impact  to be 1 in 2,700, or 0.037% chance.\n \n\n   \n  Originally, the material that Bennu is made up of came from supernovas, explosions of old stars that occurred well before the formation of the solar system. The extreme heat of the explosions acted as a forge, cooking up the elements found in the asteroid, which then endured more heat from the impact that formed Bennu, as well as radiation from the sun, further altering the elements within. Bennu has also been found to contain ammonia, a chemical that can help form molecules like amino acids, as well as different types of minerals, presenting many of the necessary ingredients for creating the building blocks of life — but not life itself.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re like jigsaw pieces that are not yet assembled,” said Angel Mojarro, a postdoctoral researcher and organic geochemist in the Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and first author of the new study. “What this is telling us is that many, many of the building blocks of life can be produced naturally within asteroids or comets, and finding tryptophan expands the alphabet of amino acids that are produced in space and could have been delivered to the Earth.”\n \n\n   \n  A total of  33 amino acids  had previously been found on Bennu, but only 14 of them are used by living organisms on Earth to build proteins. Tryptophan would join the latter group; it also belongs to a category of amino acids scientists call essential, because the human body can’t produce them and they must be acquired through diet.\n \n\n   \n  Mojarro added that more tests are required to corroborate the presence of tryptophan in the Bennu sample analyzed for the study, which weighed just 50 milligrams. However, given the pristine condition of the Bennu samples, it’s likely that the finding isn’t a result of terrestrial contamination, according to George Cody, a staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC. Cody was not involved in the study but has  worked  on Bennu samples.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe these molecules are legitimately derived from the Bennu asteroid,” Cody wrote in an email.\n \n\n   \n  By collecting the sample from the asteroid itself, researchers didn’t have to deal with the damage of atmospheric entry, which alters the chemistry of asteroids that land on Earth, making Bennu a much more reliable “time capsule” of the early solar system’s composition.\n \n\n   \n  “Because OSIRIS-REx returned these samples pristine, we’re finally seeing the fragile salts, minerals, and organics that meteorites lose on entry,” said Dante Lauretta, a professor of planetary science and cosmochemistry at the University of Arizona, Tucson, who is also a coauthor of the new study.\n \n\n   \n  Bennu’s parent body was a rich geologic world with multiple liquid systems operating in different places and at different times, each driving its own chemistry,” Lauretta added. “Bennu preserves a collection of distinct chemical systems and together they show that small bodies were dynamic, organic-rich systems long before life emerged on Earth.”\n \n\n   \n    Molecular ‘fossils’\n \n\n   \n  This paper adds to scientists’ understanding of which molecules necessary to life can be found in extraterrestrial materials, Cody said. If the natural chemistry that occurred at the dawn of our solar system produces the same molecules that life currently uses, he added, then there must be a connection between them.\n \n\n   \n  The late Harold Morowitz, a pioneer of studies about the origins of life, believed that the molecules that constitute the core of living organisms might be molecular “fossils” from the solar system’s beginnings, and   identifying tryptophan and other protein-building amino acids in Bennu samples adds weight to that idea, Cody explained.\n \n\n   \n  Finding tryptophan in Bennu further expands the remarkable diversity of compounds we now know can come from space, said Kate Freeman, Evan Pugh University Professor at Penn State University, in an email. “Asteroids were the early Earth’s grocery delivery service, having provided a wealth of molecules to our prebiotic world,” added Freeman, who was not involved with the study.\n \n\n   \n  The new research also highlights how important sample return missions are, according to Sara Russell, a professor of planetary sciences and leader of the Planetary Materials Group at the Natural History Museum in London, who did not participate in the work. Although scientists have thousands of rocks from space available in labs in the form of meteorites, they also need uncontaminated, pristine material brought to Earth by space missions in order to get the full picture, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of tryptophan in particular is surprising,” Russell added, “as we don’t see this in meteorites, perhaps because it does not survive the fall through the Earth’s atmosphere and impact on Earth.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/politics/trump-says-us-land-action-in-venezuela-very-soon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"21:22:00-05:00","title":"Trump says US land action against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela will start ‘very soon’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced plans to begin land-based military operations against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, claiming such actions will start 'very soon' in response to the decline in sea-based drug deliveries.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that the United States is preparing to  take new action  against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, telling service members during a Thanksgiving call that efforts for strikes on land will be starting “very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  “In recent weeks, you’ve been working to deter Venezuelan drug

Will it be enough? \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has pledged to use the “influence of the presidency to bring an immediate halt” to the two-year-old war in Sudan that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates has displaced nearly  12 million people .\n \n\n   \n  It’s a significant development for a crisis that has shown little sign of abating, with some experts expressing cautious optimism that the US president’s intervention could help stop the fighting. However, they warn that a long-term end to the brutal conflict will not be easily reached.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who has touted himself as a peacemaker, said last week that it was “not on (his) charts to be involved” in ending the war. However, after a personal request from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Trump said he would engage on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought it was just something that was crazy and out of control. But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan, and we’re going to start working on Sudan,” he said at an event alongside the Saudi leader in Washington, DC last Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The war has been raging for more than two years between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It has claimed tens of thousands of lives and given rise to the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Both sides have been accused by the US of war crimes; the Biden administration declared that the RSF  committed genocide .\n \n\n   \n  The US has been working for years alongside Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt as part of what’s known as “the Quad” to try to broker an end to the fighting and establish a path to a democratic transition in Sudan. The efforts by the Trump administration have been led by Special Envoy Massad Boulos, a Trump ally and Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law.\n \n\n   \n  But to date, the White House has stayed out of the negotiations, which changed with Trump’s direct commitment last week and has created some optimism among experts.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a whole bunch of very needed and necessary short-term objectives that Trump can help to bring about,” said Cameron Hudson, an Africa analyst and former director for African Affairs on the National Security Council.  “There’s no question, and I think he’s uniquely positioned to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, a week after his commitment, it is unclear how specifically the president plans to personally use his influence. Diplomatic efforts continue to stall; Sudan’s top general rejected the latest ceasefire proposal this weekend and accused the mediators of bias.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no sense that there’s a shift in Washington. There’s no sense that now there’s going to be a strategy,” said Kholood Khair, the director of the Khartoum-founded think tank Confluence Advisory. “It’s incredibly unlikely” that there is movement on a truce before the end of the year, Khair told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Questions of pressure\n \n\n   \n  The conflict has been heavily fueled by  outside support . There have been calls for the US to increase the pressure on the United Arab Emirates, which has been widely accused, including by US  lawmakers  and a  UN panel of experts , of supplying weapons to the RSF. The UAE has denied this.\n \n\n   \n  “Sudan has become, really, the theater of war for a lot of the US allies in the region,” Khair said.\n \n\n   \n  There are questions about whether Trump himself is prepared to exert pressure on allies, particularly the UAE.\n \n\n   \n  Khair noted that the administration “has interests with Abu Dhabi specifically related to Israel,” as the UAE is a member of the Abraham Accords. She argued that the accords, which Trump touts as a keystone foreign policy achievement, is “a far higher priority” to the US president than Sudan.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family also has business ties to the UAE, Khair noted. The Trump Organization is  making millions  from licensing agreements and cryptocurrency deals with government backed businesses in the country, Forbes reported last month.\n \n\n   \n  The US has not publicly pressured the UAE, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio said recently that “something needs to be done to cut off the weapons and the support the RSF is getting.”\n \n\n   \n  “I can just tell you at the highest levels of our government, that case is being made and that pressure is being applied to the relevant parties,” Rubio said in mid-November. He has spoken twice in two weeks with his Emirati counterpart.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some experts told CNN that Trump is more likely to have sway over the outside actors than the warring parties themselves as the US has little leverage over the RSF or SAF.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is “well positioned to mediate among the outside powers, because all of those powers are their friends. It’s Turkey, it’s Egypt, it’s Qatar. It’s Saudi. It’s UAE,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump is made for that moment,” he added. “He’s made for the moment of striking an elite deal among big men. What he’s not made for is rolling up his sleeves and getting involved in the nitty gritty of Sudanese politics.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeffrey Feltman, a former US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, said that Trump’s comments were “promising” and “encouraging.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m persuaded that the Quad countries will only take Sudan seriously… if they believe the President finds this important,” he told CNN. “There has to be a serious reduction in violence, and I don’t see where the US has the leverage to do that, meaning we have to use our leverage on those that do.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Manal Taha, a security and peace process expert from Sudan, told CNN that a ceasefire between the two warring generals “is not going to stop the war and the suffering on the ground.”\n \n\n   \n  The war has become tribal and ethnic, and there have been so many atrocities, the “generational trauma has to be addressed,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/26/middleeast/pope-leo-turkey-lebanon-first-trip-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"13:52:00.000Z","title":"Pope Leo Takes Message of Peace to Middle East on First Foreign Visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, begins a six-day foreign visit to Turkey and Lebanon on November 24, 2025, marking his first international trip since election.

Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Christopher Lamb, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:52 AM EST, Fri November 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pope Leo XIV begins a six-day visit to Turkey and Lebanon on Thursday, his first foreign trip  since his election  and one on which he’s expected to emphasize key themes of his fledgling pontificate – among them dialogue and unity.\n \n\n   \n  Overseas trips are an important part of the papacy’s “soft power,” offering an opportunity for the pope to meet political leaders of his host country, address the local Catholic community and focus international media attention on regional issues.\n \n\n   \n  By going to Lebanon, Leo is flying into the heart of a conflict-ridden Middle East, and he is due in Beirut just days after  Israeli strikes on the Lebanese capital. \n \n\n   \n  For Leo, the visit can give added weight to his appeals for harmony and dialogue in the Middle East, echoing the first words he uttered after his election: “Peace be with you all.”\n \n\n   \n  He is also following in the footsteps of Pope Francis, who used his papal visits to try to help war-torn countries such as South Sudan and the Central African Republic. Francis also went to Turkey and the  Holy Land  early in his papacy.\n \n\n   \n  The first American pope is embarking on his first trip during the US Thanksgiving holiday, a time when gratitude, togetherness and peace come to the fore.\n \n\n   \n  These themes may take on a broader, global resonance in a visit to two Muslim-majority countries that are home to ancient Christian communities. The pope’s trip is also expected to have a strong focus on dialogue and unity between the different branches of Christianity. Leo will also give all his speeches in English and French, and not in Italian, marking a shift in papal culture with the first US-born pontiff, who speaks several languages fluently.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a breakdown of the trip:\n \n\n   \n    Why is the pope traveling to Turkey and Lebanon?\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo is honoring the promises made by his predecessor, Francis, to visit both countries. Francis had planned to visit Lebanon in 2022 and Turkey at some point in 2025 to commemorate an important church anniversary, but both trips were postponed for health reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Leo has also been formally invited to visit the countries by their respective presidents. While Turkey is a country where most of the population is Muslim, it is home to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who is considered the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox church and has his headquarters in Istanbul.\n \n\n   \n  The Eastern and Western branches of Christianity split in 1054 in what was described as the “great schism.” Efforts have been made in recent decades to heal the divisions, with Francis, Benedict XVI and John Paul II all visiting Turkey early in their pontificates.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Pope Leo is following his predecessors by going to Turkey on his first trip abroad. It is a massively Muslim country, but he is going there for Christian reasons,” Cardinal Michael Fitzgerald, a former leader of the Vatican’s office for inter-religious dialogue, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Vatican has long been engaged in Middle Eastern diplomacy, and in 2021 Pope Francis  hosted  Lebanese Christian leaders in the Vatican to address the country’s political crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Leo’s visit to Lebanon comes after he has repeatedly called for dialogue and peace in the region. While Lebanon’s population is majority Muslim, the president of the country (currently Joseph Aoun) is by convention a Maronite Christian.\n \n\n   \n    What anniversary is Leo marking in Turkey?\n \n\n   \n  Leo is going to celebrate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, which took place in modern-day Iznik, northwestern Turkey. The council of 325 AD agreed on a formulation of Christian belief out of which developed the “Nicene Creed,” which is still said in Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and other churches today.\n \n\n   \n  While in Turkey, Leo will take part in an event Friday in Iznik with Patriarch Bartholomew and other church leaders to mark the creed’s anniversary. Ahead of his visit, Leo published a letter saying that the 1,700th anniversary of Nicaea should encourage churches to “leave behind theological controversies that have lost their raison d’être,” while calling for “reconciliation through dialogue.”\n \n\n   \n  The Grand Ecclesiarch Aetios (Dimitrios Nikiforos), the director of Patriarch Bartholomew’s private office who has been helping to plan the papal visit, told CNN that marking the anniversary “can also serve as a decisive moment for the present and the future of Christianity and its witness in the contemporary world.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that protection of the environment will be on the agenda as part of “raising ecological awareness through common mobilization.” Bartholomew is sometimes referred to as the “Green Patriarch” for his environmental work.\n \n\n   \n  Leo will also be in Turkey to mark the feast of Saint Andrew, an important ceremony for the Orthodox Church, and the pope is expected to sign a joint declaration with the patriarch.\n \n\n   \n  In an age of division and religious persecution, “the symbolical presence of two global spiritual leaders renders the witness of Christianity more credible and impactful,” the Rev. John Chryssavgis, a theologian and adviser to Bartholomew, told CNN. He added that Leo’s visit underlines the “close connections and search for unity between Rome and Constantinople.”\n \n\n   \n  While in Turkey, Leo will also make his first visit as pope to a mosque, Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, but he won’t go to the  Hagia Sophia,  a former church and later museum, which was converted back into a mosque in 2020. At the time, Pope Francis described himself as “pained” by Turkey’s decision. On Saturday, Leo will celebrate Mass with an estimated 4,000 people at the Volkswagen Arena in Istanbul, and, in a late addition to the schedule, he’ll visit the Diyanet – the Presidency of Religious Affairs – in Ankara and meet the Chief Rabbi of Turkey.\n \n\n   \n    What is Leo doing in Lebanon?\n \n\n   \n  The pope arrives Sunday in Lebanon, where he is due to meet political leaders and young people, take part in an inter-religious gathering and celebrate a Mass on the Beirut waterfront.\n \n\n   \n  On December 2, Leo will pray in silence at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion, which left 218 dead and injured more than 7,000. Many in Lebanon are still waiting for an explanation as to its cause and, in early August, Leo sent a message to a vigil marking five years since the blast.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanon is made up of a rich tapestry of different religious groups and is home to 12 Christian communities; Leo is due to have a private meeting with some of their leaders. He will also have a private meeting with Muslim and Druze leaders.\n \n\n   \n  The largest Christian grouping in Lebanon is the Maronites, an eastern church that recognizes the authority of the pope and is part of the Catholic Church but has its own traditions, including allowing married men to be ordained as priests.\n \n\n   \n  Leo will visit the monastery of Saint Maron, the 4th century patron of the Maronite church, so he can pray at the tomb of another important saint, Charbel Makhlouf, a monk renowned for bringing people of different faiths together.\n \n\n   \n  The pope’s busy schedule also includes a visit to a large psychiatric facility run by Catholic religious sisters, the Dde la Croix hospital in Jal el- Dib, and he’ll plant a cedar tree while in the Presidential Palace in Beirut.\n \n\n   \n  The Rev. Michel Abboud, who is president of Caritas Lebanon, the Catholic church’s charitable arm in the country, told Vatican News that the pope’s visit means “the people will know that, despite all the difficult situations they have been through, they must not feel abandoned.”\n \n\n   \n    How does the pope travel and who is he traveling with?\n \n\n   \n  The first pontiff to travel by airplane on an official trip was Pope Paul VI, when he flew to Jordan in 1964, marking the beginning of modern-day papal foreign travel. Leo will fly on an ITA Airways plane, a papal flight sometimes nicknamed “Shepherd One,” accompanied by around 80 journalists.\n \n\n   \n  He will be accompanied by senior figures from the Vatican, including the cardinals who run the departments for Christian unity, inter-religious dialogue and eastern churches, his secretaries and a medical team. The pope and his party sit at the front of the plane and media at the back. Pope Francis would go to the back of the plane to greet all the journalists traveling with him individually, and on the way back would hold a press conference.\n \n\n   \n  A papal press conference has not been confirmed but if one is held, it will likely be on the returning flight. Leo has been holding impromptu press gaggles outside the papal retreat in Castel Gandolfo.\n \n\n   \n  While he’s in Turkey and Lebanon, Leo will be transported by car and military helicopter, and is expected to use a papal-style golf-buggy in the Volkswagen arena in Turkey. A Vatican spokesman told reporters on Tuesday that Leo will use open- top transport in both countries but “the most appropriate vehicle will be chosen depending on the situation.”\n \n\n   \n    Where will he stay?\n \n\n   \n  Popes normally stay in the residence of the papal ambassador – known as the “apostolic nuncio” – when on overseas visits, and the Vatican has embassies in the capital cities of both Turkey and Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  While in Turkey, however, he is not staying overnight in Ankara, so will instead be staying at the Apostolic Delegation in Istanbul, the home of the Holy See representative in Turkey before the capital moved. The property is on Papa Roncalli Street, named after Pope John XXIII, who was the Holy See representative to Turkey and Greece in the 1930s and 40s.\n \n\n   \n    Will Leo celebrate Thanksgiving?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not known if or how Leo will celebrate and a Vatican spokesman said he did not have any information to share when asked by CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  One of his brothers, John, has talked of how Leo loves Thanksgiving stuffing, a side dish that traditionally accompanies roast turkey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/africa/guinea-bissau-general-president-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"18:50:00-05:00","title":"General sworn in as transitional leader of Guinea-Bissau as ousted president arrives in Senegal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a swift military coup on November 26, 2025, Guinea-Bissau’s armed forces ousted President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, citing a destabilizing plot by narcotraffickers.

Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Guinea-Bissau’s military installed Major-General Horta Nta Na Man as transitional president on Thursday, an army statement said, a day after soldiers  toppled President Umaro Sissoco Embalo  in a swift power grab that followed a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  The president who was ousted in the coup, Umaro Sissoco Embalo, arrived in Senegal aboard a special flight following an intervention by the West African regional bloc, Senegal’s foreign ministry said in a statement late Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It was the ninth coup in West and Central Africa in five years and continued a pattern of instability in Guinea-Bissau, a notorious cocaine transport hub with a long history of military interventions in politics.\n \n\n   \n  The self-styled “High Military Command for the Restoration of Order” announced in a televised statement on Wednesday that they had ousted Embalo. They said the move came in response to a destabilisation plan involving politicians and drug barons, without going into more detail.\n \n\n   \n  Wearing a military uniform and flanked by other military officials, Inta-a made his first public appearance as leader at a ceremony broadcast Thursday on state television. He said the coup was necessary to stave off a plot by “narcotraffickers” to “capture Guinean democracy” and said the transition would last one year, beginning immediately.\n \n\n   \n  At a swearing-in ceremony later on Thursday, he named Major-General Tomas Djassi as army chief of staff.The takeover came a day before provisional results were due to be announced in the race between Embalo and Fernando Dias, a 47-year-old political newcomer who had emerged as Embalo’s top challenger in the presidential vote.\n \n\n   \n  Before the coup announcement, gunfire rang out in the capital Bissau for about an hour on Wednesday near the electoral commission headquarters and presidential palace.\n \n\n   \n  Embalo called French media to say he had been deposed.\n \n\n   \n  An army statement dated Thursday and published before Senegal announced Embalo’s evacuation, said Embalo and other top officials were “under the control of the High Military Command”.\n \n\n   \n    Condemnation of the coup\n \n\n   \n  African Union chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf condemned the coup in a statement and called for the release of Embalo “and all detained officials.”\n \n\n   \n  Heads of state from the West African regional bloc ECOWAS also condemned the coup and later held a virtual meeting to discuss the situation, according to a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Screen grabs shared with the post showed several regional leaders participating, including the presidents of Nigeria, Senegal and Liberia, as well as the AU’s Youssouf.\n \n\n   \n  The European Union said constitutional order should be restored and the vote count allowed to proceed.\n \n\n   \n  Central Bissau was mostly quiet on Thursday, with soldiers on the streets and many residents staying indoors, even after the overnight curfew lifted. Businesses and banks were closed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very concerned about the prevailing situation,” Julio Goncalves, a 30-year-old professor and Bissau resident, said.\n \n\n   \n  ”No pharmacy is open. If somebody is sick how can he buy medicine or go to the hospital?”\n \n\n   \n    ‘False coup attempt’\n \n\n   \n  Before Inta-a’s presidency was announced, Dias accused Embalo in a video statement of staging a “false coup attempt” to derail the election because he feared he would lose.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, the coalition backing Dias demanded that authorities be allowed to release results from Sunday’s presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  The coalition also called for the release of former Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira, who was detained on Wednesday, according to relatives and security sources.\n \n\n   \n  Security forces used tear gas to break up a small protest outside the building where Pereira is said to be held. They also broke up a gathering near Dias’s home on the outskirts of Bissau and live rounds were fired, witnesses said.\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of casualties related to the violence on Wednesday or Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    Coup-prone narcotics hub\n \n\n   \n  Guinea-Bissau is a small coastal nation situated between Senegal and Guinea that is a notorious transit point for cocaine bound for Europe.

\n  By Christopher Lamb, Sana Noor Haq, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:01 PM EST, Thu November 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pope Leo XIV warned of “conflict on the global level” in an impassioned address to civic leaders and lawmakers in Turkey, against the backdrop of several wars in the region.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now experiencing a phase marked by heightened level of conflict on the global level, fueled by prevailing strategies of economic and military power. This is enabling what Pope Francis called a Third World War fought piecemeal,” Leo told the assembly at the Presidential Palace in Ankara.\n \n\n   \n  Leo was speaking on his first foreign trip, a six-day visit to Turkey and Lebanon where he’s been addressing key themes of his fledgling pontificate, with the visit an opportunity for him to exercise the papacy’s soft power diplomacy. From the start of his election, Leo has emphasized the importance of dialogue between those who disagree, the dangers of polarization and called for peace in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n   Leo  arrived in Ankara – where he was greeted by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – on Thursday for a six-day trip which includes Lebanon. He was expected to emphasize the key themes of his fledgling pontificate, and follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Francis, who used his platform to draw attention to conflicts around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Leo issued a stark assessment of the world order being destabilized by “ambitions and choices that trample on justice and peace” Thursday, on his first diplomatic tour abroad since becoming the leader of the Catholic world in May.\n \n\n   \n  “We must in no way give in to this,” the first American pope said. “The future of humanity is at stake.”\n \n\n   \n  Erdogan echoed that Leo’s visit to Ankara came at a “highly critical time” amid wars in the region, referencing Israeli forces’ ongoing  attacks in Gaza , and a deadly Israeli strike on the only Catholic church in the Palestinian enclave  in July .\n \n\n   \n  He praised Leo’s “strong stance” on advocating for Palestinian dignity and human rights. “The ceasefire reached in Gaza must be reinforced, the safety of civilians must be guaranteed, and humanitarian aid much reach Gaza without any interruptions,” Erdogan told diplomatic leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Thursday, Leo wished Americans a happy Thanksgiving on board his papal plane and thanked journalists for their work as he traveled to Turkey.\n \n\n   \n  “To the Americans here, happy Thanksgiving,” Leo said as he greeted reporters flying from Rome.\n \n\n   \n  Leo thanked journalists “for the service that you offer,” adding that “it’s so important today that the message be transmitted in a way that really reveals the truth and harmony that the world needs.”\n \n\n   \n    Focus on ‘unity’ and ‘peace’\n \n\n   \n  His visit to Turkey and Lebanon, Leo said, is focused on “unity” and “peace,” and “to look for the ways all men and women can surely be brothers and sisters in spite of differences, in spite of different religions, in spite of different beliefs.”\n \n\n   \n  After touching down in the Turkish capital, Leo met Erdogan at the Presidential Palace on Thursday afternoon local time. The pope emerged from a black car and stepped onto a blue carpet, before shaking hands with Erdogan at the palace entrance.\n \n\n   \n  Leo is visiting two countries with a majority Muslim population but that are home to ancient Christian communities. His visit to Beirut comes several days after bombing by Israel’s military on the Lebanese capital.\n \n\n   \n  On board the plane, Leo greeted each of the roughly 80 journalists on board individually, including CNN, after receiving gifts of two pumpkin pies and a pecan pie, traditional Thanksgiving desserts. As he received the dishes, Leo said he planned to share some of the pumpkin pies.\n \n\n   \n  Among the other gifts presented to the pope were a baseball bat once used by Nellie Fox, the legendary Chicago White Sox baseball player – which is Leo’s team – and some White Sox slippers and socks.\n \n\n   \n  Leo, a keen Wordle player, recently revealed that he opts for a different starter word of the popular online puzzle game each day. When asked by the Associated Press how he had got on today, Leo said he had completed the puzzle in three attempts.\n \n\n   \n  Before he circulated among reporters, the pope was also greeted by Mexican journalist Valentina Alazraki, whose first papal flight was in 1979 with John Paul II. Alazraki stressed that although Leo might feel like he’s going into the lion’s den by meeting journalists he had “nothing to fear.” She presented him with an icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe, beloved by Catholics from across North and South America.\n \n\n   \n  The first day of Leo’s trip also saw him lay a wreath at Ataturk’s mausoleum, the resting place of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of Turkey.\n \n\n   \n  He departed Ankara for Istanbul later Thursday, after visiting the Diyanet, the Presidency of Religious Affairs in Turkey, and meeting the country’s chief rabbi.\n \n\n   \n  Although a constitutionally secular state, Turkey has a predominantly Muslim population and is home to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who is considered the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church and has his headquarters in Istanbul.\n \n\n   \n  Leo is due to meet with him on Friday and take part in celebrations of an important church landmark: the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, which formulated core Christian beliefs. The celebrations are taking place in modern-day Iznik, northwestern Turkey, where the council was held in 325 AD.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/26/us/travis-turner-virginia-manhunt","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00-05:00","title":"High School Coach Wanted on Child Pornography Charges in Rural Virginia","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A high school football coach in rural Virginia, Travis Turner, is wanted on five counts of child pornography possession and five counts of using a computer to solicit a minor.

Turner’s football team, knowing he had disappeared, played a regional semifinal game without him,  winning 12-0  to keep their season alive.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, state police announced the charges he is sought for, saying they obtained warrants for each count a day earlier. They have not released further details about the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  Brett Hall, the commonwealth’s attorney for Wise County, told CNN Wednesday over email his office “is aware of the ongoing investigation pertaining to charges against Union High School’s head football coach” but can’t comment further.\n \n\n   \n  Turner, who was also listed as a physical education teacher at Union High School in a now-removed entry on the school’s online   staff roster, was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt, sweatpants and glasses, state police said. The agency hasn’t   shared any details about when or where he was last seen or who may have seen him last.\n \n\n   \n  Union High School is located just outside the community of Big Stone Gap and a few miles southeast of Appalachia, the town where Turner lives.\n \n\n   \n  In an email to CNN Tuesday, the   Wise County Public Schools superintendent, Mike Goforth, said the district is “aware that law enforcement has filed charges against a staff member who has been on administrative leave.”\n \n\n   \n  Turner is not permitted on school property or to have contact with students, Goforth said.\n \n\n   \n  Students and community members gathered for a prayer circle before kickoff Saturday, three days before the charges against Turner were publicly announced.\n \n\n   \n  “No matter what’s going on, we can count on our neighbors, and we can count on those God’s put in our life, and we can count on our community to be bigger than the situation we’re facing,” Bryan Gunter, pastor of First Baptist Church of Big Stone Gap, said at the time,  CNN affiliate WCYB reported .\n \n\n   \n    Terrain poses challenges\n \n\n   \n  Turner “went into the woods” near his home in Appalachia, Jason Day, an officer with Virginia State Police, told local TV station  WJHL  over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Since Turner’s disappearance, authorities have used search and rescue teams, drones and police dogs to try to locate him, state police  said this week . One search and rescue organization, Black Diamond, said it participated in the search for Turner but could not release any additional details.\n \n\n   \n  Searching the area, nestled in a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains, isn’t easy.\n \n\n   \n  Its  rugged topography , carved by rivers and forests with elevations that vary from low valleys to high peaks, makes for a challenging environment for search and rescue operations.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of police dogs and foot traffic, authorities may need to rely on technology, like motion sensors left in an area of interest that send signals to the search team’s base, or drones with heat-sensing abilities that can track movement, according to John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. That’s not a perfect science, he notes, given all the activity such sensors pick up.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many resources are dedicated to the search overall.\n \n\n   \n  “Once you’re into man versus nature and wide open spaces, a lot of that hinges on the key dependency – what is the training experience and ability of the fugitive to operate in that environment?” Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  “And we’ve seen both versions of that   ﻿(in other cases), from people who were lifelong woodsmen and survivalists to people who had no background in camping and ran up into the woods and immediately ran up against the challenges of lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  If Turner is in the woods, weather could impact how he fares. Since his disappearance, the area has seen warmer than normal temperatures during the day and overnight – sometimes with light rainfall, but not enough to flood the area – according to CNN meteorologist Mary Gilbert. In the coming few days, Friday is expected to be the coldest, with highs just above freezing and lows in the upper teens. Some of the days after that offer potential for some icy, wintry weather and several rain chances.\n \n\n   \n    Family is ‘prayerful for his safe return’\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN on Tuesday, Turner’s wife shared a statement from the family’s attorney, whom she identified as Adrian Collins.\n \n\n   \n  “I speak today on behalf of Coach Turner’s family. We remain prayerful for his safe return and for everyone affected by the circumstances surrounding his disappearance. We trust God to bring truth and clarity in His time. Any allegations should be addressed through the proper legal process – not through speculation or rumor,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  The statement closed by asking for the family’s privacy.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Collins for more information. CNN also sought comment from a person who is now serving as the interim head coach of Union High’s football team.\n \n\n   \n  Turner attended Appalachia High School himself, years before it was consolidated, along with Powell Valley High School, into Union High School in August 2011, according to reports by the  Bristol Herald Courier.  He was a quarterback on the school’s football team, coached by his father, Virginia High School League Hall of Famer Tom Turner, from 1994 to 1997, the newspaper reported.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout his college career, Turner played   football   at Virginia Tech, Eastern Kentucky and the University of Virginia-Wise, the Bristol Herald Courier reported. He was then hired as head football coach at Powell Valley High School in early 2011, according to the newspaper.\n \n\n   \n  As for the Union High team that Tuner coached until last week: It will play in a  regional final  game at home against Ridgeview on Saturday afternoon. If Union wins, it would advance to the Class 2 state semifinal on December 6, one step before the state final set for December 13.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/style/faberges-winter-egg-christies-auction","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"11:35:00-11:35","title":"‘Greatest of them all’: Fabergé’s Winter Egg is poised to smash auction records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Winter Egg, one of only three Imperial Eggs by Peter Carl Fabergé remaining in private hands, is set to be auctioned by Christie’s in London in November 2025. Commissioned in 1913 for Tsar Nicholas II's mother, Maria Feodorovna, it is widely regarded as the greatest and most artistically unique of the 50 Imperial Eggs, designed by female workmaster Alma Pihl who inspired its ice-like, naturalistic design with snowflakes and carved anemones. The egg’s rarity, craftsmanship, and emotional imperial significance have made it a symbol of cultural heritage. Christie’s estimates its sale will exceed £20 million, breaking its own 2002 record. However, the sale faces significant geopolitical and economic hurdles: the U.S. imposes a 35% import tariff, and Russia's sanctions prohibit any acquisition, even through proxies. Experts warn that the market is 'highly compromised,' and the buyer remains unknown, raising questions about cultural ownership and global politics. Despite these challenges, the auction underscores the enduring value of Fabergé’s art and its role in connecting imperial history with contemporary global markets.","keyTakeAways":["The Winter Egg is considered the greatest of the 50 Imperial Eggs, praised for its artistic originality and naturalistic design, which sets it apart from other more ornate Fabergé pieces.","Only three of the 50

previous records, with Christie’s estimating a price in excess of £20 million ($26 million), potentially breaking the 2002 record.","The value is not derived from precious materials like gold or diamonds, but from the craftsmanship and artistic vision, especially the use of clear quartz and rose-cut diamonds to evoke the image of frost and snow.","The Winter Egg was designed by female workmaster Alma Pihl, a rare instance of female creative influence in a traditionally patriarchal Russian industry, making it historically significant.","The egg's design and origin story reflect a unique blend of nature and artistry — the inner surprise features carved wood anemones, which bloom after winter, symbolizing resilience and renewal.","The egg’s history includes a sale by the Soviet Union in the 1920s–1930s for £450, and a long period of disappearance until 1994, when it was rediscovered and resold at record prices.","The auction is currently facing political and market

poised to smash auction records \n       \n  Oscar Holland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:35 PM EST, Thu November 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There may soon — potentially  very  soon — be a time when even the world’s greatest riches are unable to purchase one of Fabergé’s legendary Imperial Eggs. There will simply be none left on the private market.\n \n\n   \n  The storied St. Petersburg jewelry house only ever produced 50 for the Russian Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II, who commissioned them as Easter gifts between 1885 and 1916. Seven are missing, some of which have not been seen since before the Russian Revolution. The others are mostly in institutions or museums, from Moscow to Virginia, leaving just seven in private ownership.\n \n\n   \n  Of these, some are in “fairly sacrosanct” collections, according to Fabergé expert Kieran McCarthy, meaning only three remain in what he called “truly private” hands and could ever be realistically acquired. “They are incredibly rare,” said McCarthy, who is co-managing director at Wartski, a British antique jewelry dealer specializing in the works of Peter Carl Fabergé. “And they are getting even rarer.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, for the first time in over two decades, one of the three is up for auction. And the eggs’ scarcity is, partly, why auction house Christie’s estimates that 1913’s Winter Egg will fetch “in excess of” £20 million ($26 million) in London next month. Should this price be realized, the 112-year-old curio would not only set an auction record for a Fabergé egg — it would obliterate the one the Winter Egg itself set in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Supply and demand aside, Christie’s believes its astronomical estimate reflects the object’s unique artistic qualities. Made from a block of clear quartz, the egg looks as if it has been carved from ice and dusted with frost. Engraved snowflakes sparkle with rose-cut diamonds; platinum trickles down the base as if it were thawing in spring sunshine.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like holding a lump of ice in your hand,” said McCarthy, who has previously handled the Winter Egg. “It’s like alchemy in reverse, turning precious materials into a moment of nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Like all Imperial Eggs, this one also opens to reveal a “surprise.” And although the objets d’art hidden inside Fabergé eggs were typically feats of intricate mechanics (a miniature wind-up steam train, or a clockwork songbird flapping its wings), the Winter Egg’s surprise is rooted in nature: a hanging basket filled with wood anemones. Usually among the first flowers to bloom after Russia’s notoriously frigid winter, their tiny petals are carved from white quartz and sat on nephrite stems, with bright green garnets dotting their stamens.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy, who curated the 2021 exhibition “Fabergé in London: Romance to Revolution” at the Victoria & Albert Museum, said the Winter Egg is “perceived to be the greatest of them all,” calling it “the most iconic Russian work of art, quite arguably, ever.”\n \n\n   \n  The head of Christie’s Fabergé and Russian artworks department, Margo Oganesian, concurred, describing it as “the most spectacular, artistically inventive and unusual” of the 50 Imperial Eggs. And although the auction house clearly has commercial motives to trumpet the object’s status, Oganesian pointed to invoices proving it has always been among the most valuable. Nicholas II paid 24,600 rubles for it — the third-highest sum Fabergé ever charged for a work. The two costlier eggs are, unsurprisingly, both in museum collections, she added.\n \n\n   \n  The Winter Egg’s price tag was relative not to the materials it was carved from, but to the craftmanship required to transform them into snow and ice. Clear quartz, also known as rock crystal, is by no means the rarest or most expensive mineral, but it is exceptionally brittle and difficult to work with. And although the egg is covered in diamonds — around 4,500 of them — the stones are small enough to be of “no intrinsic value,” McCarthy said, adding: “The value comes purely in the artistic expression of them and the use of them to create this scintillating idea of frost.”\n \n\n   \n    Timeless design\n \n\n   \n  Nicholas II commissioned the Winter Egg as a gift for his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, who had received one annually from her husband (and Nicholas’ father) Alexander III, until his death in 1894. The eggs took the best part of a year to produce and were ordered shortly after the latest had been delivered. The tsar never gave Fabergé specific instructions or ideas — he, too, seemingly enjoyed the surprise.\n \n\n   \n  With its muted palette and simple inner workings, the Winter Egg was not an archetypally ostentatious, bejeweled Fabergé creation. That difference is, today, a selling point, Oganesian said. “Most of them are based on historical styles — of Rococo or Neoclassicism — but the Winter Egg is an object in its own style,” she said, adding “the design is timeless — it’s so modern.”\n \n\n   \n  Unusually for patriarchal Russia (and for, at the time, an almost exclusively male jewelry industry), the design originated from one of Fabergé’s female “workmasters,” Alma Pihl. Initially hired to document the house’s inventory as a drafter and watercolorist, she had joined the workshop of her uncle, Fabergé’s chief jeweler Albert Holmström, in 1908.\n \n\n   \n  As the — perhaps apocryphal — origin story goes, Pihl came up with the idea while gazing out of the window from her workshop bench. She saw ice crystals forming on the glass and wondered how their appearance might be recreated in jewelry. (Christie’s says this tale is “possible,” and McCarthy goes further to say there is “no real reason to disbelieve it.”) Holmström then brought her design to life with a team of jewelers, each responsible for different parts of the egg.\n \n\n   \n  World War I broke out a year after the egg was delivered to Nicholas II, who was toppled by the Bolsheviks before the conflict’s conclusion. The newly formed Soviet state quickly sold off many of the empire’s treasures to raise funds — and often below market value. The Winter Egg was among them, purchased by Wartski in the late 1920s or 1930s for just £450 (roughly $30,000 in today’s money). It then passed through a succession of private British collections before disappearing and considered lost for almost two decades from 1975.\n \n\n   \n  The Winter Egg reappeared in 1994 and was soon offered at Christie’s in Geneva, where it fetched over 7.2 million Swiss francs (then $5.6 million) and set a new auction record for a Fabergé egg. It broke its own record eight years later, at the same auctioneer’s New York saleroom, its price tag jumping to $9.6 million. Christie’s has never disclosed the buyer’s identity but confirmed to CNN that the “noble” who acquired the item in 2002 is behind next month’s sale.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Compromised’ markets\n \n\n   \n  The egg’s next destination, given Christie’s fierce defense of its clients’ privacy, may never be known. It is, nonetheless, a question that is intriguing experts.\n \n\n   \n  According to McCarthy, the two biggest Fabergé markets of recent decades, the United States and Russia (which he said has seen “a huge fervor for the repatriation of Russian works of art to Russian soil”) are both “highly compromised.” Importing the artwork to the US would incur a 35% tariff, McCarthy explained, meaning millions of dollars in additional duties. Russia, meanwhile, is currently subject to strict sanctions. Even having “ reasonable cause to suspect ” that assets will end up in Russian hands constitutes a breach. “There could potentially not have been a  worse  time to sell this egg,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “In the recent past, Middle Eastern museums — with their striving to acquire great works of art in order to broaden their appeal and develop a post-oil economy — would have been (the obvious) destination for this egg,” McCarthy added. “But whether they have an appetite for this particular one, at the moment, I have no idea whatsoever. The natural destination in different circumstances, would, of course, have been Russia. Institutions in Russia, I’m sure, would like it. But, of course, they should not buy it, technically.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Christie’s told CNN that it operated a “global anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions compliance program” that includes “client due diligence and screening checks,” though the auction house did not confirm whether additional checks were in place to ensure the Winter Egg was not purchased by a Russian proxy. “We remain committed to complying with all relevant AML and sanctions laws, including any applicable luxury goods prohibitions,” the statement added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/sport/golf-fuzzy-zoeller-dies-at-74","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"13:39:00-05:00","title":"Fuzzy Zoeller, two-time major champion haunted by racist joke about Tiger Woods, dies at 74","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Fuzzy Zoeller, a two-time major champion and beloved figure in golf known for his sportsmanship and memorable moments, died at 74.

Zoeller, a two-time major champion and one of golf’s most gregarious characters whose career was tainted by a racially insensitive joke about Tiger Woods, has died, according to a longtime colleague. He was 74.\n \n\n   \n  A cause of death was not immediately available. Brian Naugle, the tournament director of the Insperity Invitational in Houston, said Zoeller’s daughter called him Thursday with the news.\n \n\n   \n  Zoeller was the last player to win the Masters on his first attempt, a three-man playoff in 1979. He famously waved a white towel at Winged Foot in 1984 when he thought Greg Norman had beat him, only to defeat Norman in an 18-hole playoff the next day.\n \n\n   \n  But it was the 1997 Masters that changed his popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Woods was on his way to a watershed moment in golf with the most dominant victory in Augusta National history. Zoeller had finished his round and had a drink in hand under the oak tree by the clubhouse when he was stopped by CNN and asked for his thoughts on the 21-year-old Woods on his way to the most dominant win ever at Augusta National.\n \n\n   \n  “That little boy is driving well and he’s putting well. He’s doing everything it takes to win. So, you know what you guys do when he gets in here? You pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not serve fried chicken next year. Got it?” Zoeller said.\n \n\n   \n  He smiled and snapped his fingers, and as he was walking away he turned and said, “Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve.”\n \n\n   \n  That moment haunted him the rest of his career.\n \n\n   \n  Zoeller apologized. Woods was traveling and it took two weeks for him to comment as the controversy festered. Zoeller later said he received death threats for years after that moment.\n \n\n   \n  Writing for Golf Digest in 2008, he said it was “the worst thing I’ve gone through in my entire life.”\n \n\n   \n  “If people wanted me to feel the same hurt I projected on others, I’m here to tell you they got their way,” Zoeller wrote. “I’ve cried many times. I’ve apologized countless times for words said in jest that just aren’t a reflection of who I am. I have hundreds of friends, including people of color, who will attest to that.\n \n\n   \n  “Still, I’ve come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away.”\n \n\n   \n  It marred a career filled with two famous major titles, eight other PGA Tour titles and a Senior PGA Championship among his two PGA Tour Champions titles.\n \n\n   \n  More than winning was how he went about it. Zoeller played fast and still had an easygoing nature to the way he approach the game, often whistling between shots.\n \n\n   \n  He made his Masters debut in 1979 and got into a three-way playoff when Ed Sneed bogeyed the last three holes. Zoeller defeated Sneed and Tom Watson with a birdie on the second playoff hole, flinging his putter high in the air.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve never been to heaven, and thinking back on my life, I probably won’t get a chance to go,” Zoeller once said. “I guess winning the Masters is as close as I’m going to get.”\n \n\n   \n  Zoeller was locked in a duel with Norman at Winged Foot in the 1984, playing in the group behind and watching Norman make putt after putt. So when he saw Norman make a 40-footer on the 18th, he assumed it was for birdie and began waving a white towel in a moment of sportsmanship.\n \n\n   \n  Only later did he realize it was for par, and Zoeller made par to force a playoff. Zoeller beat him by eight shots in the 18-hole playoff (67-75). Zoeller’s lone regret was giving the towel to a kid after he finished in regulation.\n \n\n   \n  “If you happen to see a grungy white towel hanging around, get it for me, will you?” he once said.\n \n\n   \n  He was born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana. Zoeller said his father was known only as “Fuzzy” and he was given the same name. He played at a junior college in Florida before joining the powerful Houston golf team before turning pro.\n \n\n   \n  His wife, Diane, died in 2021. Zoeller has three children, including daughter Gretchen, with whom he used to play in the PNC Championship. Zoeller was awarded the Bob Jones Award by the USGA in 1985, the organization’s highest honor given for distinguished sportsmanship.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/26/politics/national-guard-shooting-washington-dc","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Suspect Identified as 2 National Guard Members Remain in Critical Condition After Targeted Shooting Near White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A targeted shooting occurred near Farragut Square in Washington, D.C., on November 27, 2025, when a suspect named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 and applied for asylum in 2024, opened fire on two West Virginia National Guard members during a high-visibility patrol.

Officials said earlier the suspect is in custody.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN the shooter’s initial identification matches a man from Washington state who applied for asylum in 2024, which was granted by the Trump administration earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The two guard members had been performing “high visibility patrols” near the White House before the suspect appeared, “raised his arm with a firearm and discharged at the National Guard,” said Jeffery Carroll, the executive assistant chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, during a news conference earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Bowser and FBI Director Kash Patel said during the news conference the two guard members are in critical condition.\n \n\n   \n  DC Mayor Muriel Bowser described the attack as a “targeted shooting” in a  post on X  and said the two guard members shot were part of the West Virginia National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  “To the American public and the world, please send your prayers to those brave warriors who are in critical condition and their families,” Patel said during the news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Carroll added during the presser “there is no indication” that there is another suspect, adding that the suspect in custody was taken to an area hospital.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place near Farragut Square — a tourist-heavy area located near a busy transit center and the White House.\n \n\n   \n  A source familiar with the investigation told CNN earlier Wednesday that law enforcement officials are not tracking any other victims of the shooting beyond the two National Guard officers and the suspect.\n \n\n   \n  Three law enforcement sources told CNN that the suspect approached the guardsmen and appeared to target them, firing first at one of the guardsmen who was mere feet away.\n \n\n   \n  One source said the suspect then fired at the other guardsman, who tried to get behind a bus stop shelter. The source added that the suspect is not cooperating with investigators and had no identification on him at the time of his arrest.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about the shooting\n \n\n   \n  Video from the nearby Metro station showed the shooting as it happened, law enforcement officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The gunman approached three National Guard members who appeared to not see him until he began shooting, striking one guard member and then another, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The gunman then stood over the first victim and appeared to try to fire another round. That’s when the third guard member returned fire at the alleged shooter, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  A woman who was near the scene of the shooting told CNN she heard gunshots and then saw a “bunch of people” administering CPR to people who were on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  Two law enforcement sources said earlier Wednesday the suspect was detained and transported away from the scene on a stretcher.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities ran the fingerprints of the man in custody and that’s how they got the initial name, one law enforcement official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators recovered a handgun believed to have been used in the attack on the National Guard members and are working to determine when and how the suspect obtained it, law enforcement officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  US law restricts firearms sales to people who aren’t citizens or legal permanent residents and it’s unclear whether the alleged gunman could have legally bought the handgun, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the Wednesday news conference, there were conflicting reports about the condition of the guardsman after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey posted on social media — and later corrected — that the guardsmen were believed to be dead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the day, DC Metropolitan Police  said  on X that the scene is secure and one suspect is in custody. They advised people to avoid the area.\n \n\n   \n  Joint Task Force — DC, the National Guard office responsible for organizing the Guard mission to Washington, DC, confirmed in a statement Wednesday afternoon that “several” of its members “were involved in a shooting near the Farragut West Metro Station,” adding that it is working with DC police and other “law enforcement agencies.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump addresses nation and calls for re-examining Afghan immigrants\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump identified the suspect as an Afghan national in a video from Mar-a-Lago posted late Wednesday and blamed the Biden administration for allowing him into the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I can report tonight that based on the best available information, the Department of Homeland Security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan — a hell hole on earth,” Trump said in the video, adding that the suspect “was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not going to put up with these kind of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn’t even be in our country,” Trump added. “We must now reexamine every single alien who’s entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Following Trump’s remarks, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in  a post on X  that the processing of all immigration cases related to Afghan immigrants “is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration was already in the process of re-interviewing Afghan migrants admitted to the US during the previous administration,  CNN reported earlier this week . Trump officials have repeatedly argued that the previous administration didn’t sufficiently vet the people who entered the US.\n \n\n   \n  In his video, Trump also reiterated his request to deploy 500 more National Guardsmen to Washington, DC, in response to the shooting, which was shared by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the shooting, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, saying, “The animal that shot the two National Guardsmen … is also severely wounded, but regardless, will pay a very steep price.”\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance, during remarks at an event in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, called for prayers for the national guardsmen, who he said were in critical condition at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting is “a somber reminder that soldiers whether they’re active duty, reserve or National Guard are soldiers are the sword and the shield of the United States of America,” Vance added.\n \n\n   \n    National Guard troops in nation’s capital since August\n \n\n   \n  National Guard troops from multiple states have been in Washington, DC, for months as part of President Donald Trump’s anti-crime crackdown in the nation’s capital, which has since expanded to other cities across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump mobilized the National Guard in August and the troops were authorized to conduct law enforcement activities.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported last month that National Guard troops  will remain mobilized  in the city at least through February.\n \n\n   \n  However, last week a federal judge  halted the mobilization  of the National Guard in Washington, DC, ruling that Trump and the Defense Department illegally deployed the troops.\n \n\n   \n  In her ruling, the judge said there were “more than 2,000 National Guard troops” every day in the city.\n \n\n   \n  The judge did not immediately order the National Guard to leave the city, allowing the Trump administration some time to file an appeal, which it did Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The administration earlier Wednesday asked a federal appeals court  for an emergency stay  of the judge’s order to remove the National Guard from Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/26/politics/snap-democratic-attorneys-general-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"14:46:00-05:00","title":"Democratic Attorneys General Sue to Block USDA Guidance That Makes Some Immigrants Ineligible for SNAP Benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to block a new guidance that makes certain immigrants—such as refugees, asylum seekers, Afghan and Ukrainian parolees, and victims of severe trafficking—ineligible for SNAP (food stamp) benefits, even if they become lawful permanent residents.

\nUpdated: \n        2:46 PM EST, Thu November 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A coalition of 21 attorneys general sued the US Department of Agriculture on Wednesday in an effort to block recent guidance from the agency that declared some immigrants, including refugees and those granted asylum, ineligible for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or  SNAP, benefits .\n \n\n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the coalition of other Democratic attorneys general, said in  a statement  that the Trump administration is illegally cutting off the benefits — also known as food stamps — for tens of thousands of lawful permanent residents.\n \n\n   \n  “The federal government’s shameful quest to take food away from children and families continues,” James said in the statement. “USDA has no authority to arbitrarily cut entire groups of people out of the SNAP program, and no one should go hungry because of the circumstances of their arrival to this country.”\n \n\n   \n  The attorney general from Washington, DC, and the following states joined in on the lawsuit: Oregon, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.\n \n\n   \n  On October 31, the USDA provided new guidance to states narrowing SNAP eligibility, aligning with rollbacks of the program outlined in President Donald Trump’s domestic policy law that passed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The attorneys general argue in the  lawsuit  that the memo goes beyond what the law prescribes since it would make anyone who entered the country through humanitarian protection programs permanently ineligible for food stamps, even if they become legal residents.\n \n\n   \n  According to the lawsuit, some immigrant groups are exempt from the rule that requires lawful permanent residents to have lived in the US for five years before receiving benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is that the Guidance lists some, but not all, of the conditions that render an (lawful permanent resident) immediately eligible for SNAP without a five-year waiting period,” the attorneys general said in the lawsuit. “It omits key categories of Humanitarian Immigrant Groups, like Refugees and Individuals Granted Asylum.”\n \n\n   \n  Some groups that are exempt from the waiting period but not listed in the guidance include “Certain Afghan and Ukrainian Parolees, Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants (SIV), and Victims of Severe Trafficking,” according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  The group of attorneys general warn that the USDA’s guidance, which prompts a swift overhaul of eligibility systems, “threatens to destabilize SNAP nationwide,” and could put significant financial strain on states that would have to shoulder the cost of fines.\n \n\n   \n  The attorneys general also slammed the USDA for starting the 120-day exclusion period for the guidance on the day Trump’s policy law went into effect instead of the day the agency issued the guidance. The 120-day period expired on November 1 — just one day after the guidance was sent to the states, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit asks a federal judge in Oregon to vacate and block the implementation of the USDA’s guidance.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for USDA declined to comment on “pending litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the lawsuit, James and other attorneys general asked the USDA last week  to “correct” the guidance  and provide “clarity on SNAP eligibility,” to which the agency didn’t respond, Wednesday’s statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The filing comes just days after a federal judge in Virginia dismissed an indictment against James, whom Trump has viewed as a political opponent.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/sport/olympics-2026-ukraine-sports-minister-interview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"11:26:00-05:00","title":"Ukrainian Sports Minister Rejects Idea of Russian Athletes Returning for Winter Olympics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian Youth and Sports Minister Matviy Bidnyi has rejected the idea of Russian and Belarusian athletes returning to compete under their national flags at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, stressing that peace talks are still ongoing and that the war has caused extensive damage to Ukraine’s sports infrastructure—800 facilities damaged since 2022.

EST, Thu November 27, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukrainian Youth and Sports Minister  Matviy Bidnyi  told  CNN Sports  that it’s “too early” to speak about Russian and Belarusian athletes competing under their nations’ flags at next year’s Winter  Olympics , with  peace talks  to end the war in Ukraine still ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  As it stands, those with a Russian and Belarusian passport may only compete as individual   neutral athletes ( AINs ) at next year’s Winter Games, with each separate case  being reviewed  to ensure there had been no previous support of the war.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Russian and Belarusian teams – such as in ice hockey – will face a blanket ban from competition, while any national signifiers, such as flags, will be prohibited at Olympic venues.\n \n\n   \n  But, with  peace proposals  aimed at ending the war between Ukraine and Russia gaining new traction, the possibility of a peace deal being reached before the Games in  Milan-Cortina   begin on February 6 seems less remote, opening the question around whether those suspended athletes could compete for their nation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s too early to talk about it,” Bidnyi told CNN Sports, when asked whether a peace deal could open the door for those athletes to return.\n \n\n   \n  “We (Ukraine) have a lot of issues with the preparation to competition. We have a lot of killed coaches and athletes, we have had a lot of losses because of the war, because of Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we are too far from the final position where we can say that justice was achieved.”\n \n\n   \n  There had been  optimism  from the Trump administration that a deal was close this week – with a US official even briefing reporters in a closed group that Ukraine had agreed to a peace proposal.\n \n\n   \n  However, such claims were  tempered  by a senior Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of the negotiations who told CNN that there were at least three crucial areas in the proposal where significant differences remain.\n \n\n   \n    800 sports facilities damaged\n \n\n   \n  While talks continue, the impact of the war has continued to damage Ukraine’s ability to prepare for major international competitions, such as the Winter Olympics.\n \n\n   \n  According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Sport, 800 sports facilities across the country have now been damaged since the full-scale invasion started in 2022, up from over 500 reported by Bidnyi in  July  2024.\n \n\n   \n  The vast majority of Ukrainian athletes must therefore train and prepare for the Winter Olympics abroad. Bidnyi said that 18 Ukrainian athletes have so far qualified for the Games, but there were hopes around 40 would be heading to Italy when competition starts.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, the facilities for winter sports need even more resources. It needs more electricity at least, for example, ice arenas need a stable electricity flow,” Bidnyi said, adding that the number of damaged facilities increases almost every week due to Russian aggression.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, if you walk on the Kyiv streets, you can hear a lot of generators, engine generators for electricity, because we have a big problem with it, because Russia makes (energy) terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the International Olympic Committee (IOC) so far upholding the suspension of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing under their respective nation’s flag for the Winter Games, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC)  lifted the ban  for the Paralympic Winter Games which follow the Winter   Olympics.\n \n\n   \n  The international federations for individual Paralympic sports can therefore decide whether or not to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete – although some athletes have already missed qualification opportunities to reach the Games. Still,  several federations  have either upheld the ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes or decided not to facilitate the qualification of either nation, such as the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), the International Biathlon Union (IBU) and World Curling.\n \n\n   \n  Bidnyi called the IPC’s decision “strange” and urged sporting governing bodies to uphold their support of Ukraine by not allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete on the international stage.\n \n\n   \n  He said a strong ceasefire needed to be agreed upon and seen in practice before those athletes should re-enter the global stage, in addition to funds being allocated to Ukraine to help with the rebuild of the country.\n \n\n   \n  Then, and only then, does Bidnyi think negotiations could start regarding Russian and Belarusian athletes being reintegrated.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes, international sports organizations, they attempt to support the Russian and Belarusian athletes, covering it by the principle of autonomy of sport, some political neutrality, that sports should be out of the politics,” Bidnyi said.\n \n\n   \n  “But everybody should understand the war is not politics, the war is a crime. And if you make crime, I think you can’t be allowed to have an international stage or justify your crime.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of our international partners, I think, have a too diplomatic position on it. I think we must be more united on things, that sports is an important part of the international agenda … international sports organizations have a responsibility for the situation in society.”\n \n\n   \n  But whether or not Russian and Belarusian athletes compete, the Winter Olympics are yet another stage in which Ukraine can show its resilience through sport.\n \n\n   \n  Much like the Ukrainian national soccer team, which still has a chance of qualifying for the  FIFA World Cup  next year, athletes traveling to the Games have the opportunity to bring some joy to those still facing an uncertain future back home.\n \n\n   \n  For Bidnyi, having Ukrainians compete at major events is a symbol of strength and hope after so many years of war.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine won a single medal at the previous  Winter Games in 2022 , when Oleksandr Abramenko claimed silver in the men’s aerials event in freestyle skiing, following up on his gold medal at  PyeongChang 2018 .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s one more important opportunity to talk about Ukraine, to show our athletes,” he said, telling CNN Sports he had only slept three hours the night before because of Russian shelling attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, being in the biggest international sports context, it’s a big honor for Ukraine, and I think it’s a sign of our resilience. It’s a sign of our power as a country and it shows our will to win, not only in the sports facilities but in terms of a battlefield for our values, for our common values, our European, free world values.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5624991","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00+00:00","title":"Snow and Ice Create Hazardous Conditions, Travel Chaos Across Parts of the US","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major winter storm impacted the Midwest and Great Lakes, with up to 12 inches of snow, leading to widespread travel disruptions, crashes, and flight cancellations.

  \n      \n\n         A heavy winter storm continued to blanket large parts of the country on Sunday, leading to crashes and disrupting travel plans for millions returning home from the Thanksgiving holiday.  The  National Weather Services (NWS)  warned that parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes regions could see up to 12 inches of snow by the end of Sunday, as  a second storm threatened the east coast. \"As one winter storm ends for the Midwest/Great Lakes, another potential storm will follow quickly for New England and the Mid-Atlantic,\" the NWS said Sunday morning. The agency  said the second storm would likely bring a mix of snow and ice, causing more potential disruptions as people return back to school and work next week. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Snow and ice will create slick travel conditions in western Montana and parts of Idaho, with 3 to 6 inches of snow forecast for Monday into Tuesday, according to  the NWS . The weekend storm over the Midwest began to slow Sunday, leaving behind strong winds that reduced visibility and kept road crews busy cleaning major highways. In Chicago, residents woke up to over 8.5 inches of snow Sunday morning, with wind gusts of up to 35 mph expected to continue throughout the day.  Nearly 1,300 flights to and from Chicago O'Hare International Airport had been delayed and more than 280 had been canceled, according to  FlightAware  data Sunday evening. The airport received 8.4 inches of snow on Saturday, making it the snowiest November day in Chicago's recorded history, according to the  NWS . The previous record was 8.0 inches on November 6, 1951. A Delta Air Lines plane slid off the runway at Des Moines International Airport around before 10:00 p.m. local time Saturday.  Airport operations resumed  before noon local time on Sunday. Nearly 82 million people  were estimated to travel  at least 50 miles for the holiday, with 6 million expected to travel by plane, according to AAA. Car crashes related to the winter storm were also reported across the Midwest region. Indiana State Police responded to a 45-car pileup on Saturday that temporarily closed a portion of Interstate 70 near Putnamville, south of Indianapolis. The Missouri State Highway Patrol  posted on social media  Saturday that it had responded to 26 crashes across the state. Officials warned travelers about more accumulation on Monday. A new storm system forecast to develop Monday will spread to the East Coast on Tuesday, bringing heavy snow to the northern mid-Atlantic and New England, including Pennsylvania and Maine. It will also bring heavy rain to the Southeast, according to NWS meteorologist Andrew Orrison. He said Monday will be the best day for those traveling home from the holiday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Tuesday the travel conditions will be worse as there will be more of a widespread impact for rainfall,\" Orrison told NPR. \"And also, if you get far enough north, areas getting snow, that'll be accumulating.\" Weather-related delays are also coinciding with disruptions caused by mandatory software upgrades  to Airbus A320 aircraft . Airbus on Friday told airlines to take immediate action to upgrade the software in the aircraft, warning there could be an issue with flight controls. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency directive Friday night requiring airlines using A320s to upgrade the software before the planes can fly again.  American Airlines, the U.S. carrier with the largest A320 fleet, said it had updated all of its planes by Saturday afternoon.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/entertainment/stranger-things-season-5-recap-tvrep","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"The 5 strangest and most marvelous things about ‘Stranger Things 5,’ so far","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The final season of 'Stranger Things' introduces several shocking and emotionally charged moments, including a violent attack on the Wheeler family, the revelation that Mr. Whatsit is actually Vecna, and the character arcs of Erica Sinclair and Derek Turnbow.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Congratulations: You’ve taken time out of your Thanksgiving holiday and made it to the end of nearly 5 hours of Netflix viewing and are up to date (for now) on the final season of everyone’s favorite  retro-’80s tween horror tale, “Stranger Things.” \n \n\n   \n  If you’re not, run away back into the Upside Down, since you’re about to be spoiled.\n \n\n   \n  While the story definitely ended with quite a flourish at the close of episode 4 (more on that below), there were a few other truly standout moments from this first of three volumes that will make up the final season.\n \n\n   \n  From the extremely terrifying to the extremely satisfying, let’s talk about it:\n \n\n   \n    The attack on the Wheelers\n \n\n   \n  The end of episode 1 and start of episode 2 this season packs one of the most horrifying and violent sequences in the series yet, as little Holly Wheeler (Nell Fisher, a stellar new addition to the cast after the character was aged up this season), sister to Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Mike (Finn Wolfhard), is taken from her home by a Demogorgon after the Wheeler parents are brutally attacked and left for dead.\n \n\n   \n  The slow motion sequences of mom Karen Wheeler (Cara Buono) getting clawed by the demon while a horrorstruck and blood-spattered Holly watches are almost too much. They’re tempered only by the slightly delicious moment just before, when Karen – like so many unfortunate parents in supernatural ’80s titles that inspired “Stranger Things,” like “Poltergeist” and “E.T.” – finally learns that her assurances to her daughter that “there’s no such thing as monsters” are entirely, patently untrue.\n \n\n   \n  While Karen and her famously taciturn husband Ted (Joe Chrest) survive, no one is by any means out of the woods yet. By the end of this batch of episodes, the pair is still in the hospital and Holly is still missing, lost in a decidedly foreboding dreamscape.\n \n\n   \n    The identity of Mr. Whatsit\n \n\n   \n  Sure, this one we could see coming, but it makes it no less satisfying to see “Stranger Things” creators Matt and Ross Duffer borrow from another brilliant throwback title when it comes to Holly’s not-so-imaginary friend Mr. Whatsit.\n \n\n   \n  Upon Holly’s disappearance and with mom Karen’s help, Mike and Nancy make the connection that Mr. Whatsit – loosely connected to Madeleine L’Engle’s watershed science-fiction work, “A Wrinkle in Time,” which Holly is seen reading in the show – is, in fact, Henry Creel/the series’ archvillain Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower).\n \n\n   \n  If you’re keeping score, this is far from the last reference we will get to “A Wrinkle in Time,” since we now very much know what  Camazotz  refers to.\n \n\n   \n    Season MVPs: Erica Sinclair (obviously!) and…Derek Turnbow?\n \n\n   \n  This season might only be halfway through, but it is certainly not too soon to crown Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson) an all-time “Stranger Things” MVP. Lucas’s (Caleb McLaughlin) zero-nonsense little sister has been a thorough delight since the second she showed up in Season 2, but this go-round, she levels up to true young boss lady when she shows up at the Turnbows with a benzo-laced pie to knock them out in order to set the trap for the Demogorgon.\n \n\n   \n  When her best frenemy Tina (Caroline Elle Abrams) declines to indulge in the pie, the shot of Erica whipping out a needle and saying, “And I told you to eat your damn pie!” is just too good and light-years away from the well-mannered young actress who talks about how she was afraid of hurting her costars’ feelings in Netflix’s Season 2 rewatch.\n \n\n   \n  It is also worth mentioning a peculiar new addition, Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly), an at-first highly unlikeable bully who does a complete about-face in episode 4 and becomes a vital asset to our dogged team of Hawkins heroes. He goes from “dipshit Derek” to “delightful Derek” in an astonishing turn, even leading a highly effective guided meditation.\n \n\n   \n    Holly’s Tiffany Sidestep montage\n \n\n   \n  While (at least so far) nothing can come close to how Kate Bush’s timeless  “Running Up that Hill” figured into Season 4 , ’80s pop hit “I Think We’re Alone Now” is spectacularly showcased in episode 3 this season, with Holly being gifted a Tiffany cassette tape by her strange new friend along with a  totally tubular Sidestep stereo .\n \n\n   \n  The sequence showing her dance and twirl while baking chocolate cakes with sprinkles and trying on pretty dresses is enough to make anyone want to go back to being a kid. Of course, as is so often artfully done on the show, the nostalgic glee soon gives way to a menacing feeling just underneath the surface, when Holly is interrupted by an insistent knock at the door and instructions to go into the woods.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Sorcerer’ Will Byers\n \n\n   \n   The Duffers said  they designed each batch of episodes this season to lead to its own climax, and boy, were they right when it comes to volume 1. At the end of episode 4 – titled “Sorcerer” – Will (Noah Schnapp) finally takes the offense against the Demogorgons, becoming something of a Vecna himself in the process. Speechless doesn’t even cut it.\n \n\n   \n  There are still massive, pressing questions: Does his nose bleeding mean that he’s now become like Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown)? Or do those eyes indicate he is becoming Vecna himself?\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of those answers, watching this character go from being pretty much the perpetual victim for four seasons to this new iteration is thrilling and opens up so many new possibilities. The hardest part now is waiting until Christmas, when Volume 2 premieres, to see how it all plays out next.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5626164","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00-05:00","title":"Venezuela calls Trump's call to close airspace a 'colonialist threat'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Venezuelan government condemned President Donald Trump's statement calling for the closure of all airspace above Venezuela as a 'colonialist threat' and a violation of international law, asserting that no foreign authority can interfere with its sovereign airspace.

Venezuela to be closed. In a Truth Social post , Trump said \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" The Venezuelan government  responded with a statement  saying Trump's comments violate international law and are a \"colonialist threat\" to the country's sovereignty. \"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutional framework has the power to interfere with, block, or condition the use of international airspace,\" the statement said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As of Sunday afternoon,  Flightradar24  shows planes continuing to fly in Venezuelan airspace. This comes a day after the Senate and  House Armed Services committees  said they would look into the Pentagon after  The Washington Post   reported  that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to kill all crew members aboard a boat suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean in September. NPR has confirmed the Washington Post's reporting. The military has carried out  at least 21 strikes  and killed at least 82 people on alleged drug boats as part of \"Operation Southern Spear,\" a campaign that the Trump administration says is aimed at tackling drug-trafficking. Venezuela said in its statement that \"such statements represent an explicit use of force, which is prohibited by Article 2, paragraph 4 of the U.N. Charter of the United Nations.\" Democrats have also strongly criticized the administration's strategy, saying the military didn't have enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs before conducting the strikes. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, told ABC'S  This Week  on Sunday it's possible the military's actions could be considered a \"war crime,\" and that Hegseth should be held accountable. \"They've never presented the public with the information they've got here,\" Van Hollen said, \"But it could be worse than that, right? If that theory is wrong, then it's plain murder.\" However, Republican Senator Eric Schmitt, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said on  Sunday Morning Futures  on Fox News that Trump is acting \"well within his Article 2 powers\" when it comes to curbing drug smuggling by striking the boats. \"I think it's a two part strategy,\" Schmitt said. \"One is to get rid of the precursors that are coming from China, and then take out the cartels that are distributing this and bringing it to the United States of America.\" Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have expressed frustration at Trump's stance on Venezuela, and that the Trump administration conducted the strikes without legislative approval. \"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  posted on X  on Saturday, hours after Trump's post about Venezuelan airspace. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former Trump ally, also posted on Saturday, saying \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5623225","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"SNAP was restored, but many Indigenous Americans still struggle with food insecurity","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown in November 2025, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) faced disruption, leaving millions of low-income Americans, especially Indigenous Americans, at risk of food insecurity.

Mary Lefthand pulls her truck up to a warehouse in the valley below.  She's driven over the   town of St. Ignatius, to pick up free food from the  commodity program  run by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. Tribal commodity food programs are federally funded, but weren't impacted by the federal government shutdown. Unlike SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), which was very much under threat. During the government shutdown, SNAP's 41 million recipients  didn't know if they would receive benefits  for November. Lefthand receives SNAP. She prefers it to the commodities program, because with SNAP she can go to the grocery store and pick out her own items. But during the shutdown, she became increasingly anxious amid the uncertainty over SNAP payments. She decided to switch to the tribal commodity program. \"Because I have three growing grandkids that eat a lot,\" she explained.  Lefthand relies on food aid for her entire grocery budget. But often it still isn't enough for her and her three grandchildren. \"Toward the end of the month, I feed them plain rice and whatever I can find,\" Lefthand says. When the Trump administration said it wouldn't send SNAP payments for November, tribes scrambled to fill the gap. Any disruption to food aid can hit American Indian communities particularly hard. \"More than 60% of Native people rely solely on that source of food as their primary source of food,\" says  Valarie Blue Bird Jernigan , professor of medicine and rural health at Oklahoma State University. Research indicates that  forty-six percent  of Indigenous Americans struggle with food insecurity every year, compared to about 10% of the general U.S. population.  SNAP has resumed regular payments, but tribes and their members may continue to see financial strain from the disruption to the program. For some tribes, the commodity food programs provided a partial backstop. Tribal members who live on reservations are allowed to enroll in a commodities program, or SNAP, but not both. A lot of people on the Flathead Reservation, like Lefthand, couldn't wait to see how SNAP payments would play out, said Nicholas White, who manages the Salish and Kootenai Tribes Commodity Program. \"I got a pretty good stack of individuals,\" he says, flicking through a thick stack of applications. \"That's the number of people that are coming over to our program.\" Tribal communities who don't participate in the commodities program were left scrambling to prevent families from going hungry. The Blackfeet Nation in northwest Montana declared a state of emergency, and  slaughtered 18 buffalo from its herd.  Tribes across the West also killed more bison than they otherwise would have. However, many tribes are in the early stages of growing their herds. Any animals they kill now can significantly slow down that growth. Tescha Hawley runs the Day Eagle Hope Project, a nonprofit on the Ft. Belknap Reservation in northeastern Montana. She was able to divert some grant funding to help buy up cattle, and sent that meat to temporary food banks throughout the reservation, home to the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes. The grant money was originally meant to help tribal farmers and ranchers sell their food locally. Many  tribal communities are food deserts , so tribes and nonprofits who work with them have been trying to increase access to local food sources. During the shutdown, many tribes also increased the amount of food they handed out through their self-funded food aid programs as well. Tribes and nonprofits won't get reimbursed for the extra money and resources they expended, says  Yadira Rivera , director of Native Agriculture and Food Systems Investment at the  First Nations Development Institute . \"That's going to leave them with a future problem,\" she says. Some tribal food programs will continue to be stretched thin through the holiday season, traditionally their busiest time of the year, Rivera says. Tribal families may still be feeling a cascade of financial impacts after the disruption, even though the SNAP program eventually received a full year of funding in the deal that ended the shutdown. During the weeks of uncertainty, families may have skipped rent or another bill to put food on the table, Rivera points out. Studies  have shown  when people lose access to food assistance, they suffer other financial consequences. \"There are a lot of people who get evicted when they lose food aid, because they spend their money on food, you got to eat,\" said Georgetown Law Professor  David Super , who studies welfare law. Another example: Losing SNAP can force people to choose between buying their medications or food, according to Super. Lefthand was grateful she was able to switch quickly to her tribes' commodity program. That prevented her from getting behind on bills, she says. \"I am going to stay on commodities for a while. When they do get the food stamps back on, I'll probably get back on that,\" she says. But there's a bureaucratic hurdle she'll have to navigate first. To enroll again in SNAP, Lefthand will have to drop off the tribal commodities food program for at least a month, in order to qualify.

law enforcement officials investigate the shooting of National Guard members in Washington, D.C., U.S. immigration policy has undergone rapid changes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has abruptly halted the processing of any immigration requests from Afghan nationals, and the president has vowed to further tighten his crackdown on immigration. President Trump on Sunday said he spoke to the families of the National Guard members and has invited both families to the White House. Here is what we know. D.C. police heighten security measures for troops Federal authorities and the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Saturday that every group of National Guards patrolling the city will be accompanied by at least one D.C. police officer, though details were scant. (The development was first reported by  The Washington Post .) According to a police official who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, the officers are to draw overtime pay so that they won't be diverted from current policing assignments. The order does not apply to areas which the police department does not patrol, such as the national monuments, the U.S. Capitol, or D.C. transit locations, which are policed by other law enforcement agencies.    National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom remembered Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Summersville, W.Va., joined the service in 2023. Beckstrom's father, Gary, called her his \"baby girl\" and said she had \"passed to glory\" in a  Facebook post  on Thursday. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Friday called for residents to hold a moment of silence for the two victims of the shooting, as both were deployed as part of that state's National Guard. Morrisey said in a statement Friday that Beckstrom had made the \"ultimate sacrifice\" in service to her state and the nation. He added that both Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, had stepped forward and volunteered for the mission in D.C. Morrisey also said that Wolfe remains in \"very critical condition.\" \"These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,\" Morrisey said. \"Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.\" The suspect is now facing a charge of first-degree murder Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who allegedly shot the National Guard members, is now facing a first-degree murder charge. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said during an  interview with Fox News  on Friday that the charges against Lakanwal have been upgraded to first-degree murder and that there are \"many more charges to come.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Lakanwal, who was 5 years old when the war in Afghanistan started, immigrated to the U.S. in 2021 when U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban toppled its government. Lakanwal worked with  an elite counterterrorism unit , which was operated by the CIA, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit run by U.S. veterans and others who served in Afghanistan. The organization has said specialized units like this one were used to carry out extremely violent clandestine missions. According to CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Lakanwal was able to resettle in the U.S. with his family because of the work he did on behalf of American intelligence. Officials are looking for leads in the U.S. and abroad as there is yet no definitive motive for the shooting.

In a statement Sunday the prime minister's office said that Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President. The president's office called it an \"extraordinary request,\" carrying with it \"significant implications.\" Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He has not yet been convicted of anything. The request comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu. In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country and that a pardon would help restore national unity. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead the country. Netanyahu's request consisted of two documents — a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. They'll be sent to the justice ministry for opinions and will then be transferred to the Legal Advisor in the Office of the President, which will formulate additional opinions for the president. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5625453","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"13:28:00-05:00","title":"4 Dead and 10 Wounded in Shooting at Banquet Hall in Stockton, California","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Sunday, November 30, 2025, a mass shooting occurred at a banquet hall in Stockton, California, during a family gathering, resulting in four deaths and ten injuries.

see that one of the cat snatching that snake out of a dude's bed?\" he asks. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Is it real? Is it fake?  You feel a headache coming on. \"We're being overrun by slop,\" said Mike Caulfield, a co-author of the book  Verified: How to Think Straight, Get Duped Less, and Make Better Decisions about What to Believe Online . \"It just floods the zone and at some point your mental faculties are just exhausted.\" But Caulfield and other experts say you don't need to give in to despair, at least not yet. There are a few simple dos and don'ts you can use to try and evaluate the authenticity of what you see online. Don't assume everything is fake With so much slop in our feeds, it's easy to think that  everything  you see online is fake. But that bias is just as dangerous as believing everything you see is real, warned Kolina Koltai, a senior investigator at Bellingcat, an organization that specializes in open-source investigations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Bystander videos remain an extremely important source of evidence for misdeeds by individuals and law enforcement. When people stop believing those videos, researchers call it the  \"liar's dividend\"  because it makes it easier for bad actors to claim real events are fake to evade responsibility. \"I think that's one of the bigger risks when it comes to this kind of content,\" said Koltai. \"It's not that someone's going to believe a fake video, it's that people won't believe real videos.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Koltai and others say it's especially important to carefully consider videos that might provoke a strong emotional response or run contrary to your beliefs. Real videos are often complicated situations that can provoke a response that challenges our understanding of the world. That being said, many fake videos are designed to do just that, in order to drive engagement. Do pay attention to some simple features of the video AI-generated videos are already excellent and improving quickly, said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who studies manipulated media. Even experts can be duped, he said. \"I've been doing this every day for a long time, and it's really hard. It's  really  hard.\" But there are some fairly straightforward features that can clue you in to whether the content you're watching might be AI. The biggest tip is the video length. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most companies limit the lengths of AI videos \"because making these videos is computationally very expensive,\" Farid said. Many videos end up being just 8-10 seconds in length. While it is possible to cobble together a longer video with a bunch of short cuts, \"when you see those little bite-sized videos, it's a good indication that you should take a breath.\" Length isn't the only thing; AI-generated videos tend to perfectly frame their subject, said Farid. The main characters in the video are prominently featured, and the action starts and stops cleanly, even if the video is short. That's one reason the quiz video of the New York City police officer shouting at ICE agents is obviously fake. \"It has that kind of almost professional look to it,\" he said. The position of the camera can also be strange–is it too close to the subjects of say, an ICE raid? Or does it move too smoothly to follow a running animal as if it's on a gimbal? Those could be clues it's generated by AI. Do check the context The features of a video are important, but the place it's being shared can sometimes matter even more, said Caulfield. Checking where a video was posted and even simply looking at the comments can provide powerful clues. For example, the second video of an ICE raid in the quiz came from a Reddit community for the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago. Similarly, look at who posted the video. If they have other sorts of content on their feed than just immigration raids, it lends credibility to the idea that they witnessed the raid.   \"It might be easy to fake a video but it's hard to get into a time machine and build yourself ten years of history talking about Chicago hot dogs,\" Caulfield said. If you're unsure whether the video you're seeing was originally posted by the account you're watching, try a simple  reverse image search  on Google or another platform. Often such searches can turn up the original post, other videos from the same event or news reports that either confirm or refute the video. Both the  Logan Square ICE raid  and the  moose eating popcorn  were reported by the media at the time they happened. Conversely, identifying an AI video is often as simple as looking carefully at the account that posted it. It's common for accounts to identify their content as AI-generated in their profile description, said Koltai. Even if they don't, checking the comments can often reveal that many people believe a video is AI-generated. Don't feel like you have to share it, especially if you have doubts Finally, all three researchers agree that in an age where algorithms reward speed over accuracy,  sharing is not really caring . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Much of the AI content being shared online is engagement bait, said Koltai. Its creators \"often have a monetary incentive to get you to like, comment, and share, because it often results in them making more money,\" she said. When in doubt, Caulfield said, the best thing may be to wait. \"You don't necessarily have to be the first one to share this thing, you can be the person who waits,\" he said. Often within a matter of hours, a video of an event will be confirmed by corroborating videos or news reports. Many people might not think it matters whether you share an AI video of bunnies jumping on a trampoline, or a cat snatching a snake from its owner's bed, but experts agree that it does. When people are duped by AI videos, it erodes faith in the videos that matter. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"People are like oh is it really that big a deal?\" she said. But Koltai said everyone should be worried. \"If we are unable to tell what's real and what's unreal online? That to me is really incredibly dangerous.\" Hany Farid agrees: \"Every one of those likes, clicks, shares, engagements, you're part of the problem at this point,\" he said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:   AI-generated videos seem to be everywhere these days, and some of them are pretty hard to spot. But do not despair. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has been talking to experts, and he's got a few tips for how to identify AI videos. He's with us now. Welcome, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi, Lauren. FRAYER: So a lot of people over this holiday weekend probably have relatives and friends showing them these videos, and they're wondering, is that real? Is that AI? Just how hard is it to tell these days? BRUMFIEL: It is really, really tough to spot these AI slop videos. I spoke to Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies manipulated media, and he told me this... HANY FARID: I do this every day, and I've been doing it for a long time, and it's really hard. It's really hard. BRUMFIEL: And to give you a sense of really how hard it is, Lauren, how about we look at a video together? FRAYER: Yes. I'm game. Let's do it. BRUMFIEL: All right. All right. So I have sent you this one. It's an altercation between a New York City police officer and two ICE agents. FRAYER: OK. So I'm clicking on this video. I'm looking for, like, extraneous shadows or extraneous limbs that don't fit. There's - I don't see that. BRUMFIEL: Yeah. Extra limbs or something, extra fingers, maybe. FRAYER: Yeah. But the building, the scene behind them looks normal. I'm going to say, yeah, this is legitimate. BRUMFIEL: Well, have I got news for you. This is AI-generated. FRAYER: No. BRUMFIEL: But you shouldn't feel bad because a guy named Yann LeCun, who heads research on AI for Meta and is considered one of the fathers of AI, actually posted this on his social media feed, seemingly not realizing that this was AI slop. So you are in very good company. This stuff has gotten so good. You can't look for missing limbs anymore, you know? What gives this away, actually, according to the experts I spoke to, is think about the situation, right? Like, you have a cop publicly yelling at ICE officers, and then somebody with a camera is just standing, like, two feet away calmly filming the whole thing. FRAYER: Right. BRUMFIEL: Like, how likely is that to be real? And I think that's the sort of context clues that people are starting to say you need to be looking for when you look at these videos. FRAYER: So should I be assuming everything I see online is fake? BRUMFIEL: Actually, no. In some ways, it's more dangerous to assume everything's fake, and I'll tell you why. I spoke to someone named Kolina Koltai. She's an investigator with an open-source research group called Bellingcat. And what she does is analyze things like bystander videos of ICE raids. She says if everyone starts assuming those videos are fake, society will be in real trouble. KOLINA KOLTAI: I mean, I think that's one of the bigger risks when it comes to this kind of content, right? It's not the risk that someone's going to believe a fake video but that people won't believe real videos. BRUMFIEL: And this actually has a name. It's called the liar's dividend because if everyone assumes everything's fake all the time, then guess who comes out on top? It's people who are dishonest because they can just say that video of them doing the horrible thing - that was all made up. It was AI. Like, it's not real. And so accountability becomes very, very difficult in a society where everyone thinks everything's fake all the time. FRAYER: So, Geoff, it's important that we at least try to discern what's fake and what's not. How can I at least try to spot these AI videos? BRUMFIEL: So we already talked about the context. There's some other easy stuff to look at. One is just the length of the video. AI videos, for now, tend to be pretty short because it takes a lot of computing and electricity to make them. Farid says that's a really useful thing to check. FARID: When you see these little bite-size videos, it's a good indication that maybe you should take a breath. BRUMFIEL: Of course, sometimes people make longer videos, but they do that by stitching the short ones together. So usually, once you get a feel for it, you can find them. Finally, all kinds of videos, it's good to look at not just the video itself, but what's going on around it. So AI videos have watermarks sometimes that you can see. Often the accounts - you'd be surprised - they'll actually say that they post AI-generated imagery. The comments can help, too. People often flag in the comments that something's AI. And then similarly, real videos will appear in a different sort of feed. It'll be, like, a real person's account that won't just be, I don't know, cute cat videos, or it'll be a community group for a location. And then they're often picked up by news outlets. So the last thing you can do is just, you know, check the news or wait a couple hours and check the news if it's something really big. FRAYER: Great advice. BRUMFIEL: So OK. You want to take one last shot at it with one more video? FRAYER: I think I'm ready. One more. Let's see if I can do it this time. BRUMFIEL: I think you can. Go ahead and check this next video I sent you. FRAYER: OK. So I'm clicking. It looks like - is that a kangaroo? Is that a moose, a deer? It's not a kangaroo. It's a donkey, and it's eating some popcorn... BRUMFIEL: (Laughter) This is amazing. FRAYER: ...In a movie theater. So I'm using the tools that you've just told me about. I don't see a watermark. I see a timestamp on the top. It says 9:08. Reasonable time for a donkey to go into a movie theater, perhaps - maybe the evening showing. It doesn't look too obvious. Like, I'm not seeing the donkey... BRUMFIEL: It's a moose, by the way, Lauren. FRAYER: The camera angle... BRUMFIEL: It's a moose. FRAYER: Oh, is it a moose? (LAUGHTER) BRUMFIEL: Yes. (LAUGHTER) FRAYER: Gosh. So - but I'm not seeing the moose, like, up close. You know, this looks like security cam footage. So again, risking being duped again, I'm going to say this is legit. BRUMFIEL: You are 100% right. Congratulations. You did it just exactly as you should. It does look like where a security camera would be. The moose isn't in the center of the frame.

But after being discovered in a Paris townhouse, a painting from the 17th century Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens sold Sunday at the  Osenat auction house  in Versailles for 2.3 million euros ($2.7 million). The painting, titled  Christ on the Cross , was completed in 1613 but soon vanished from public view. For centuries, its existence was known only through engravings, printed reproductions made by other artists. Its whereabouts remained a mystery until the auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat  uncovered it in September 2024  during a routine inspection of a Paris home he was preparing to sell. \"It is a masterpiece,\" Osenat  told the French wire agency AFP  shortly after making the discovery, adding the artwork was in \"very good condition.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Still, Osenat had doubts that what he stumbled upon was so uniquely valuable. It was initially believed the piece was produced from one of the many Rubens workshops. The painter had set up a large studio where he collaborated on pieces with a team of assistants. Yet Osenat says he had a hunch that maybe this piece was not like all other pieces. \"I did everything I could to try and have it authenticated,\" Osenat  told the Associated Press . So he brought it to the Centrum Rubenianum, the official Rubens committee in Antwerp, Belgium. After a scientific analysis, the painting's authenticity was confirmed by German art historian and Rubens expert, Nils Büttner. He recounted giving Osenat a call in an  interview with AFP. \"Jean-Pierre, we have a new Rubens!,\" Büttner recalled telling Osenat, according to AFP. Büttner added that authentication analysis included a microscopic examination of the paint layers, which revealed blue and green pigments consistent with Rubens' treatment of human skin. The last known owner of the painting was 19th century French classic painter William Bouguereau, before being passed down in his family,  according to the Associated Press . Born in 1577, Rubens became known as the master of the Flemish Baroque tradition, a style made popular in the 16th and 17th centuries known for its use of dramatic lighting, lifelike realism and meticulous detail. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604679","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"More cities are seeing PFAS pollution in drinking water.

water. Here's what Louisville found \n         By Morgan Watkins \n        \n           Sunday, November 30, 2025 • 9:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Ohio River sends billions   of gallons of water flowing past Louisville, Kentucky's pumping station every day, where the city's utility sucks it up to turn it into tap water. To ensure it tastes good and is safe to drink, a small team of scientists and technicians is constantly testing the water for pH, odors, heavy metals and microbes.  But unlike many smaller municipal utilities across the U.S., the  Louisville Water Company  regularly checks for PFAS ( per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ).  That's a class of chemicals, used by manufacturers for decades to make things like nonstick pans, cosmetics, raincoats, food wrappers and firefighting foam. Research   studies  have linked PFAS to  health risks  like cancer, reduced immune system functioning, high cholesterol, and developmental delays in children.  They're also known as \"forever chemicals\" because they're practically indestructible. Their strong chemical structures make them degrade incredibly slowly in the environment.  Today, they litter  soil  and  water  sources across the world and can be found in the  blood  of almost everyone in the U.S. One type of PFAS that the Louisville water technicians are tracking is HFPO-DA, though it's perhaps better known by a trade name,  GenX . Almost a year ago, workers noticed an unexpected spike in the level of GenX detected in a sample of the raw, untreated water drawn from the Ohio River for filtering and processing. https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js</a>\"> <img src=\"<a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23712566/thumbnail\" target=\"_blank\">https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23712566/thumbnail</a>\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /> In water, PFAS concentration is measured in parts per trillion. The GenX levels they found last December were 15 times higher than the previous month: 52 parts per trillion versus 3.4 parts per trillion. \"A part per trillion is like one second in 32,800 years. Put your head around that, right?\" said  Peter Goodmann , the city utility's director of water quality and research.  Another way to think of it: One part per trillion would be a single drop within 20 Olympic swimming pools. So the increased levels were still pretty low, he said. But Goodman's team was curious about what was going on. They traced the chemical up the Ohio River, past Cincinnati and through Appalachian forests, all the way to a West Virginia factory about 400 miles upstream. There, the  Chemours Co.  uses GenX to make  fluoropolymers , a special plastic critical to the semiconductors that power our phones.  Its Washington Works facility near Parkersburg, West Virginia, also has a  notorious  history of PFAS pollution. A lawyer,  Robert Bilott , fought the plant's previous owner,  DuPont , in court and  ultimately revealed  the company knew that a type of PFAS it was using, called PFOA, was toxic but didn't disclose that information. DuPont went on to  settle   various   lawsuits  claiming it contaminated local environments with forever chemicals, although the company repeatedly has denied wrongdoing. Chemours was  spun off  from DuPont in 2015. What Louisville's sudden spike means At the Louisville Water Co., the team's calculations eventually showed that the December 2024 spike in GenX levels corresponded to publicly-available data from Chemours, about its chemical discharges into the Ohio River. Still, Goodman told NPR he wasn't worried about local customers' safety — even with last year's spike. That's because risks posed by low PFAS concentrations are measured over a lifetime of exposure, he said. And recent data from Louisville show the  PFAS levels in city drinking water  fell within planned federal safety limits. Plus, water is just one way people can be exposed to PFAS, Goodman added. \"Because you get a lot more of these pollutants from packaging, from prefixed food, cake mixes, weird things, you know, popcorn boxes,\" he said. Chemours did not return a request for comment NPR. But in Chemours' responses to a  lawsuit  filed by a West Virginia environmental group, the company denied their discharges are connected to Louisville's GenX spike. (Louisville is not a party in the lawsuit.) The company also contended that sampling data showed levels of GenX in the river and in downstream utilities' treated drinking water are \"indisputably safe.\" Louisville Water's data showed the water sample it drew in December 2024 had elevated GenX levels, compared to previous months.  But after the water underwent typical treatment and filtering, the level fell under the new federal safety limit, which isn't scheduled to kick in until 2029. The federal government has long regulated the levels of  certain contaminants  in drinking water, like arsenic, E. coli and lead.  But the EPA didn't issue regulations regarding PFAS until 2024, during the final year of the Biden administration. The new limits apply to  six types of PFAS  in drinking water. Starting in 2029, utilities which exceed the limits would be required to treat the water to reduce the contamination. After Trump's re-election, his new EPA administrator  Lee Zeldin   announced  the agency will keep the rules for only two types of PFAS, called PFOA and PFOS, but drop the restrictions on the other four types, including GenX. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In addition, the EPA announced it will give water utilities two additional years, until 2031, to comply with the remaining rules, in part because of the financial burden on rural water plants. Many utilities, large and small, probably will need to  invest in infrastructure to remove PFAS . A  federal study  estimated about 45% of U.S. tap water contains at least one type of PFAS. When it announced the final PFAS limits, the Biden administration  anticipated  that up to 10% of the estimated 66,000 U.S. public drinking water systems affected by these regulations might have PFAS levels high enough to require them to take action to reduce the contamination. PFAS removal will challenge water utilities Under current federal environmental regulations, Chemours  can  release some chemicals into the Ohio River. But it has exceeded the legal limits repeatedly over several years, according to court filings and  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .  That's why the  West Virginia Rivers Coalition  filed its lawsuit in 2024. The EPA  took enforcement action  in 2023, when it said it found Chemours' West Virginia factory had repeatedly exceeded permit limits for two types of forever chemicals, GenX and PFOA.  But West Virginia Rivers Coalition said in a court filing that the EPA's consent order for Chemours \"is not being diligently prosecuted.\" Chemours declined to answer questions from NPR, citing ongoing litigation, except to point out that Louisville's \"finished drinking water is safe for consumption\" because the PFAS levels are below the EPA's regulatory limits, as stated on Louisville Water's  own website , and in the  annual water quality report   of Cincinnati, which also draws from the Ohio River . As research into the health effects of PFAS exposure continues, environmental advocates say it's imperative for companies to meet the limitations set by government permits. \"Environmental regulatory permitting is a license to pollute,\" said  Nick Hart , water policy director for the  Kentucky Waterways Alliance .  \"You're permitting someone to put something into the atmosphere, into water, into soil that would not be there otherwise. And so when we talk about the safe levels … stop using the word 'safe,' right? This is the maximum allowable limit.\" It is possible to remove PFAS from drinking water. For example, Louisville's utility is spending about $23 million to redesign its powdered activated carbon system, which is one method used to take out PFAS. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But PFAS removal can get expensive, especially for small, rural towns, Hart said. Preventing contaminants like PFAS from getting into a community's drinking water supply is easier and less costly, compared to removing it on the back end, he added. In Chemours' responses to the lawsuit, the company acknowledged that it's   violating its current permit but noted it's working with government regulators on an eventual fix. Still, the federal judge in the case,  Joseph Goodwin , decided that wasn't fast enough. In August, he  ordered Chemours to immediately stop  over-polluting. The company quickly filed an appeal. The West Virginia Rivers Coalition, which filed the lawsuit, declined to speak with NPR but did point to its  August news release  on the judge's ruling. \"This is a victory for public health and the Ohio River,\" Autumn Crowe, the organization's deputy director, said in a statement. \"The Court recognized what communities have known for years: Chemours has been polluting our water and ignoring its legal obligations.\" In a court filing for the case,  Goodmann  said that elevated levels of GenX could make it more challenging for water utilities like Louisville's to comply with federal rules for safe drinking water. In regards to Chemours specifically, Goodmann told NPR that when government regulators issue the company's next   permit, he wants them to take into account the water treatment plants downstream. \"So what we do is manage risk, and we start that at the river,\" he said. \"It sounds weird, but source water protection – keeping the stuff out of the river – is a big deal.\" This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with  Louisville Public Media  and  KFF Health News . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5625473","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"15:20:00-05:00","title":"Rubio says US-Ukraine talks on Russia war were productive but much work remains in search of a deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. and Ukrainian officials held high-level talks in Florida on November 30, 2025, aiming to reach a lasting peace deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

of a deal \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Sunday, November 30, 2025 • 3:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. — U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters afterward that the session was productive but work remains in the search for a peace deal. \"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\" The high-level negotiations in Florida came days before President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will be in Moscow to meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Rubio, Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, represented the American side in the talks, held at a sensitive time as Ukraine continues to push back against Russian forces that invaded in 2022 while dealing with a domestic corruption scandal. Diplomats have focused on revisions to a proposed U.S.-authored plan that was developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticized as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine. \"The end goal is, obviously, not just the end of the war,\" Rubio said. \"But it's also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\" \"This is not just about peace deals,\" the top American diplomat said as the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach. Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine's security council, responded to Rubio by expressing his country's appreciation for U.S. efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has at times claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for U.S. assistance during the war. \"U.S. is hearing us,\" Umerov said. \"U.S. is supporting us. U.S. is working beside us.\" Umerov, who appeared with Rubio to deliver a brief statement to reporters after the talks, underscored Ukraine's gratitude for U.S. support during nearly 4-year war. But the senior official offered no hints about what, if any, progress was made during the talks. \"Our objective is a prosperous, strong Ukraine,\" Umerov said. \"We discussed all the, important, matters that are important for Ukraine, for Ukrainian people, and U.S. was super supportive.\" Umerov has been involved in ongoing talks. But until now, Ukraine's head negotiator had been Andrii Yermak, the powerful chief of staff of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Friday, Zelenskyy announced the resignation of Yermak, after his home was searched by anti-corruption investigators. Zelenskyy's government has been roiled by fallout from a scandal over $100 million embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors, causing newfound domestic pressures for Zelenskyy. It was only a week ago that Rubio had met with Yermak in Geneva, with each side saying the talks had been positive in putting together a revised peace plan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Among the other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, and presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz. The plan, which Trump has since played down as a \"concept\" or a \"map\" to be \"fine-tuned,\" would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine's military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days. Negotiators have indicated the framework has changed, but it's not clear how its provisions have been altered. It had initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas to Russia — a sticking point for Kyiv. Trump said on Tuesday that he would send Witkoff and perhaps Kushner to Moscow this week to meet with Putin about the plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments published Sunday on Russian state television, said Putin would see Witkoff before Thursday, when Putin departs for India. Both Witkoff and Kushner, like Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza. Zelenskyy wrote on X that the Ukrainian delegation would \"swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war.\" In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said the American side was \"demonstrating a constructive approach.\" \"In the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,\" he said. Attacks continue despite diplomatic efforts to end the war On Saturday, Russian drone and missile attacks in and around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killed at least three people and wounded dozens more, officials said. Fresh attacks overnight into Sunday killed one person and wounded 19 others, including four children, local officials said, when a drone hit a nine-story apartment block in the city of Vyshhorod in the Kyiv region. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a post on Telegram Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had attacked Ukraine with 122 strike drones and ballistic missiles. \"Such attacks occur daily. This week alone, Russians have used nearly 1,400 strike drones, 1,100 guided aerial bombs and 66 missiles against our people. That is why we must strengthen Ukraine's resilience every day. Missiles and air defense systems are necessary, and we must also actively work with our partners for peace,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We need real, reliable solutions that will help end the war,\" he added. After Ukraine claimed responsibility for damaging a major oil terminal on Saturday near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, owned by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Kazakhstan told Ukraine on Sunday to stop attacking the Black Sea terminal. The CPC pipeline, which starts in Kazakhstan and ends at the Novorossisyk terminal, handles a large proportion of Kazakhstan's oil exports. \"We view what has occurred as an action harming the bilateral relations of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and we expect the Ukrainian side to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future,\" Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The president explained his decision on  social media by posting  that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\" In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S.A. He had served served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Trump's actions. \"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\" A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment. The post was part of a broader message by Trump backing Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\" Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies. In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party. Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicolás Maduro. Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, ordering a  series of strikes against boats  suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the  USS Gerald R. Ford . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro. Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S. Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras. Argentine President Javier Milei, a staunch admirer of Trump, also gave his support to Asfura in Honduras on Friday. \"I fully support Tito Asfura, who is the candidate who best represents the opposition to the leftist tyrants who have destroyed Honduras,\" the libertarian president  said on his X account . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5529265","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-24","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Here are the Books We Love: 380+ great 2025 reads recommended by NPR","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NPR's 'Books We Love' returns with over 380 new book recommendations for 2025, curated by a team of NPR staff and trusted critics.

rip apart the top motorsports series in the United States. The antitrust allegations leveled by  Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports  has exposed salacious personal communications, NASCAR's finances and a deep contempt between some of the top executives in the sport and its participants. Three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, who owns 23XI alongside Jordan and less than a month ago had the Cup Series championship slip through his fingers, warned this weekend that the gloves will be off during the two-week trial in the Western District of North Carolina. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Our fans have been brainwashed with (NASCAR's) talking points for decades,\" Hamlin  wrote on social media . \"Lies are over starting Monday morning. It's time for the truth. It's time for change.\" NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps has said that the series has tried hard to settle the case ahead of Monday's trial. What is the lawsuit about? The lawsuit was filed by 23XI Racing, which is owned by Basketball Hall of Famer Jordan, Hamlin and Jordan's longtime business manager, Curtis Polk. They were joined by Front Row Motorsports, a team owned by entrepreneur Bob Jenkins that won the 2021 Daytona 500. The two were the only teams out of 15 to refuse to sign renewals on the charter agreements NASCAR presented to them in late 2024. All 15 teams had been fighting for more favorable terms in the charter agreements over more than two years of negotiations, and the final terms fell short of what the teams had been seeking. 23XI and Front Row accused NASCAR of being a monopoly and sued under antitrust grounds. What is a charter? The charter system was introduced in 2016 and is NASCAR's version of the franchise model used by most other professional sports leagues. Being chartered guarantees that car a spot in the 40-car field for all 38 races, as well as a defined payout from the weekly purse. Even with the charters, the teams have argued that the revenue model is not viable. The teams wanted the charters to become permanent (they are renewable and revocable), a larger percentage of revenues and a voice in governance. 23XI and Front Row felt the new charter agreements fell short of meeting those demands and refused to sign. The two organizations argue NASCAR holds too strong of a hold on all aspects of the racing series and allege a monopoly based on exclusivity clauses, ownership of most of the race tracks on the Cup schedule, and its control of the rules and regulations. 23XI and Front Row are now also pursuing a large monetary sum from NASCAR to cover their legal fees and financial losses suffered this year from not being chartered plus the lawsuit. NASCAR's defense NASCAR was founded 76 years ago by the Florida-based France family and says it has not violated antitrust law because it has done nothing to restrain trade beyond normal business practices. NASCAR has argued that payouts in the 2025 charter agreement increased and prove it is not anticompetitive. NASCAR has also cited the option for cars to enter races as \"open teams\" and try to make the field in one of four nonchartered spots on qualifying speed. 23XI and Front Row have been open teams, and while their combined six cars made every race, it cost both organizations millions of dollars in purse money. The pretrial discovery process revealed NASCAR made more than $100 million in 2024. Behind-the-scenes drama The discovery phase has been brutal for both sides with the exposure of unseemly personal communications from top NASCAR executives as well as the two teams. Phelps was among leadership who in a discussion with other NASCAR executives called Hall of Fame team owner Richard Childress a \"dinosaur,\" an \"idiot\" and a \"stupid redneck.\" The discussion also included a reference that Childress \"owes his entire fortune to NASCAR\" and needed \"to be taken out back and flogged.\" Another NASCAR executive alleged that fans of the sport can't read, and multiple series leaders admonished Hall of Fame driver Tony Stewart's summer short-track series, SRX, and threatened to have it the killed because NASCAR drivers were participating. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the other side, the president of 23XI was found to have said NASCAR chairman Jim France had to die in order to receive favorable charter terms, Hamlin admitted his dislike for the France family, one of Jordan's advisers said Hamlin wasn't a good businessman and Jordan joked that he loses more money in a casino than he pays one of his drivers. Who will be in court? NASCAR has indicated it wants Rick Hendrick and Roger Penske, the two most powerful team owners in the United States, and neither Hall of Famer wants to testify. They both filed a motion asking not to even be deposed, and if they must be, then the questioning must be limited to charters. Hendrick and Penske are among a large group of owners who submitted declarations on NASCAR's behalf in defense of the charter system. The declarations showed unity among the non-suing teams, who do not want the charter system to be disbanded, which could happen if NASCAR loses the case. But, what NASCAR doesn't spotlight is that many of the team owners still noted that the 2025 charter agreements are still short of all their asks. Additionally, NASCAR has asked that some of the plaintiffs not be allowed to sit in court during the trial. It is presumed the ask is so that Jordan, a North Carolina native who led the University of North Carolina to a national championship and once owned the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, as well as Hamlin, not be given the opportunity to distract a jury. A ruling on who can sit in court had not been made as of Sunday afternoon. What are some outcomes The case could still be settled at any time, even if a ruling is made and it goes to appeal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If 23XI and Front Row win, the jury will determine actual monetary damages and Judge Kenneth Bell can adjust the figure and even triple it. Bell also would be charged with unraveling any found monopoly. Among the threats to NASCAR are orders that the France family sell the sport, sell the tracks it owns, dismantle the charter system, order permanent charters — anything is possible. If NASCAR wins, it is unlikely that 23XI and Front Row stay in business beyond 2026 and the six charters being held aside likely will be sold to other interested parties. The last charter sold went for $45 million, and NASCAR has indicated there is pressing interest from potential buyers including private equity firms. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615237","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-29","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"My Kind of Holiday Song: 'Fairytale of New York' by The Pogues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a feature on the holiday music season, Scott Simon highlights 'Fairytale of New York' by The Pogues as a poignant alternative to traditional Christmas tunes.

       By Miles Parks, David Folkenflik \n        \n           Saturday, November 29, 2025 • 5:00 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n        \n         \n         Transcript \n         MILES PARKS, HOST:   Law enforcement authorities are taking steps to tighten security in the wake of the shooting Wednesday of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. One National Guard member has died, and the other is in critical condition. President Trump says 500 more guard troops will be sent to D.C. in response, and immigration will be curtailed from a number of countries. We're joined now by NPR's David Folkenflik for the latest. Hi, David. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Miles. PARKS: So let's just start with last week. Remind us what happened. FOLKENFLIK: Well, let's focus for a moment on the National Guard members. There was 20-year-old Army National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. She grew up in Weber Springs (ph), West Virginia. She was deployed in D.C. and, according to authorities, ambushed near a Metro station there. She died on Thanksgiving of her injuries. She had served as a military police soldier, was said to have volunteered to stay in D.C. over the long holiday weekend so others could return home. The National Guard said that U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, a 24-year-old from Martinsburg, West Virginia, remains in critical condition. As you may know, in response in the District of Columbia, the Metropolitan Police Department and the military say that a police officer will accompany each patrol of guard members to help keep them safe. Those police officers will be paid overtime, according to a police official who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity. He hadn't been given permission to speak publicly about this. And the idea is that that won't divert officers from keeping other areas of the district safe. PARKS: And now, what about the man who was accused of shooting the two? FOLKENFLIK: Lakanwal, the 29-year-old Afghan national accused of shooting those troops, is now facing a first-degree murder charge because Beckstrom died. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro - she's, of course, the chief law enforcement official for the District of Columbia, at least the chief federal one - says that there are many more charges to come. She made that statement to Fox News. President Trump called the act an act of terrorism at the time, but we should note the FBI and the Justice Department and other agencies aren't assigning any motivation right now publicly or at least haven't yet. Lakanwal had come to this country after aiding U.S. intelligence initiatives in Afghanistan during the U.S. military presence there. PARKS: Can you tell us a little bit more about U.S. officials' plans when it comes to national security going forward? FOLKENFLIK: Well, you've seen that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio - last night, he tweeted that he'll stop diplomats from issuing any more visas to anyone traveling with an Afghan passport. That's in keeping with a pretty big crackdown promised by President Trump after the attack against allowing migrants to come here. Advocates for Afghan allies say that Lakanwal would have had to pass a rigorous screening process to get in this country. And in fact, he was given asylum only this year after Trump had returned to office. Advocates for Afghans fear that others who risked their lives to help the U.S. in Afghanistan against the Taliban will also be tainted by this. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, said that the administration will deploy, as you mentioned, another 500 troops to the nation's capital, though we sure don't know the details of that yet. And I think it's worth pointing out, as well, critics of the deployments, as well as the courts, have been asking all along, why are soldiers patrolling American streets at all when there are no riots or waves of violence? A federal judge has ruled the deployment to D.C. of National Guard members unlawful, but did give the administration some more time to appeal. PARKS: That's NPR's David Folkenflik. Thanks, David. FOLKENFLIK: You bet. PARKS: And later in the program, we will have more on this developing story. We'll talk with West Virginia's governor, Patrick Morrisey, about the attack that targeted two National Guard members from his state, as well as the future of guard deployments to Washington, D.C. And stay with us as we also remember Tony and Oscar award-winning playwright Tom Stoppard.

pedestal holds her hands out in the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, visible beyond the railing of Our Lady of Lebanon sanctuary. It's a tranquil place; far removed although not unaffected by the country's seemingly endless cycle of economic turmoil and security threats . Lebanon is a small multi-faith country that is about 30 percent Christian – the biggest percentage of any country in the Middle East. Last week the country celebrated a quiet 82nd independence day from French rule – with no grand parades or festivities because of what Lebanese normally call 'the situation'. The current situation is a year-old ceasefire with Israel, routinely broken by the Israeli military, including a drone strike in Beirut last week that killed the militant group Hezbollah's second-in-command. The country's financial collapse in 2019 and a devastating port explosion a year later that killed 218 people still cast a long shadow. \"The church's mission is for everyone, for all Lebanon,\" says Father Fadi El Mir, in charge of logistics for the papal visit to Our Lady of Lebanon, where Pope Leo will address the clergy and other religious workers on Monday. \"The poverty in our country is increasing every day and that's why the pope will say a lot of things to encourage us to be more effective in society and especially in our church.\" In France he ministered to struggling young Lebanese who didn't just leave, he says, but rather \"escaped\" an impossible situation in Lebanon, where there are few opportunities to make a living or provide for a family. Father Fadi, who has served in missions including South Africa and France since being ordained in 1967 says people want the Church to be more \"merciful' and responsive to them, particularly in Lebanon's many Catholic-run hospitals and schools. He speaks matter-of-factly about being shot at while he was in charge of a school in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre. \"They shot at the doors while I was coming inside. I don't know why,\" he says, shrugging. It was the same large Christian school where a priest was killed 40 years ago by militants who did not want it there, he says. Southern Lebanon is predominantly Shiite Muslim, as is the student population in Catholic schools, widely considered a better education than the public school system. Father Fadi says any tension between religious groups in Lebanon is politically driven – not rooted in the community. Israeli attacks during the war with Hezbollah have devastated Christian as well as Muslim villages along the Lebanese-Israel border in the south. Many Christians there are upset that Pope Leo will remain in Beirut and northern Lebanon during his visit. Father Fadi, a member of the Lebanese organizing committee for the visit, says he told the Vatican Pope Leo should go south. \"I said 'the people there need his presence. It would be great for him to see the people in Tyre, in that region,\" he says. \"They said 'No, no, it's impossible'.\" He says he understood it was for security reasons. 'A source of strength for us' The Tyre district in southern Lebanon includes part of the Galilee which stretches into northern Israel. It's where Jesus was believed to have preached, including the village of Canna in what is now Lebanon. According to the Bible, Jesus at a wedding in Canna performed his first known miracle – turning water into wine. Christians in Canna are now a small minority among Muslim residents. The hillside grotto where Jesus and Mary are said to have rested is open to visitors but on a recent afternoon was deserted – with burned out candles evidence of prayers but not a single visitor. The nearby village of Alma al-Chaab, the only 100 percent Christian community remaining in the Tyre district, has just a fraction of its population left after Israeli air strikes demolished or damaged almost 300 homes as well as town infrastructure during the war with Hezbollah. Mayor Chadi Sayah, elected five months ago, has organized a new ambulance paid for by donations from townspeople and a new garbage truck after the previous one was destroyed. As in many villages, people here work and save for decades to build multi-generational homes. Some of the damaged homes were small stone houses 400 years old; others new construction with swimming pools and now destroyed gardens. Almost everything grows here – oranges, olives, avocado and pomegranates. There are palm trees and pine trees that produce precious pine nuts – a source of revenue for the village. Sayah points out an area where hundreds of pine trees were chopped down while Israel occupied the village in 2024. At the edge of Alma al-Chaab, the Israeli border and military posts are less than a mile away with the coast of the Israeli city of Nahariya visible in the distance. In the other direction is a view of the bright blue waters of Lebanon's Bay of Naqoura. Sayah, on leave as a math teacher, says the village has not received a lot of support either from the state – which he says is unable to help anyone – or the church. \"We love the Lebanese state. But they should love us as much as we love them,\" he says, noting that a year after a ceasefire, they have neither electricity nor running water. \"We are a part of the Lebanese land. We want to stay here.\" He also says he expected more support from the Catholic and Maronite Catholic church. \"We believed the Church should help us rebuild,\" he says. \"If they want Christians to stay in this area they need to help.\" He reads a letter he wrote to Pope Leo to try to persuade him to come south, saying \"your visit, even if brief would be a profound source of strength for us, a sign that the Church remembers her children on the borders and a message to the world that these lands and their people are not forgotten.\" He says he won't be going to any of the Pope's events – nor will many of the village residents. Instead they will gather and plant new pine trees to replace the ones chopped down in the war. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-99329","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Sunday Puzzle: Dog Breeds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article presents a Sunday puzzle hosted by Will Shortz, in which solvers identify dog breeds based on wordplay clues.

Will, remind us of last week's challenge. SHORTZ: Yes. It came from Greg VanMechelen of Berkeley, California. I said, name some equipment an equestrian might use. Remove the second, third and fourth letters, and reverse those that remain. And the result will be some more equipment an equestrian might use. What things are these? And the answer is stirrups. You drop the T-I-R and read the rest backward, you get spurs. FRAYER: Oh, that's difficult. Nevertheless, there were 1,228 correct entries. And this week's winner is Kevin Demko of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Congratulations, Kevin. KEVIN DEMKO: Thank you very much, Lauren. FRAYER: Kevin, how did you figure this one out? DEMKO: Well, neither me nor my hubby are horse people, but we put our heads together and thought about horse equipment. And we didn't think that there would be a lot of horse equipment out there. And he came up with stirrups, and I looked at it, and I said, I think you're right. FRAYER: How long have you been playing the Puzzle? DEMKO: Oh, about 11 years now and just been waiting for this call for 11 years. (LAUGHTER) FRAYER: Well, it's great to have you on. And what do you do when you're not playing the Puzzle? DEMKO: Everything puzzle related - puzzles, crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, word games and just enjoying retirement. FRAYER: Well, Kevin, are you ready to play the Puzzle today? DEMKO: I am. FRAYER: OK. Take it away, Will. SHORTZ: All right, Kevin. We go from horses to dogs today. Every answer is the name of a breed or variety of dog. Here's your first one. What kind of dog is also a pugilist? DEMKO: A boxer. SHORTZ: Very good. What kind of dog consists of an informal term for food said twice? DEMKO: Food said... SHORTZ: It's the same word for food.

SHORTZ: So I'll tell you, it's a two-syllable... DEMKO: OK. SHORTZ: ...Kind of dog. It's got floppy ears, and the first vowel sound is a long E. DEMKO: Long E. Beagle. SHORTZ: Beagle to bugle. Good job. DEMKO: Beagle to bugle. Yeah. SHORTZ: What kind of dog would become a brand of marker if you reversed the order of the last two letters? DEMKO: A shar-pei. SHORTZ: Shar-pei to Sharpie. Ooh, you are sharp. FRAYER: Wow. That's... SHORTZ: What kind of dog has three Hs in its nine-letter name? DEMKO: Three letter Hs. SHORTZ: Yes. DEMKO: Chihuahua. SHORTZ: Chihuahua. Nice. What kind of dog contains somewhere within it the consecutive letters C-H-S-H? DEMKO: Oh, Lauren, help me. FRAYER: I mean, if you can spell chihuahua, you can spell this one. It's... DEMKO: Well... FRAYER: I didn't know this was how you spelled it. DEMKO: That may be my problem. C-H-S-H... SHORTZ: And it's a two-syllable name. And the first syllable ends with the S, and the second syllable starts with the H. DEMKO: Oh, boy. FRAYER: I think it might be a synonym... DEMKO: Oh, dachshund. Dachshund. FRAYER: Yeah. SHORTZ: Dachshund. Good job. DEMKO: Dachshund. FRAYER: You got it. SHORTZ: Well, what kind of dog contains a place in Canada as part of its name? DEMKO: A place in Canada as part of its name. SHORTZ: Yeah. Think of a region, and it's in Eastern Canada. DEMKO: A region in Eastern Canada - I failed geography in school. SHORTZ: Actually, there's two answers, and one of them starts with N. DEMKO: N. SHORTZ: It's in Eastern Canada. DEMKO: A - oh, a Newfoundland. SHORTZ: Newfoundland. DEMKO: A Newfoundland. SHORTZ: And then there's another one that starts with L.

Speaking on Fox News Saturday morning,  FDA Commissioner Marty Makary  said the agency would no longer \"rubber-stamp new products that don't work,\" claiming it made a \"mockery of science.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Makary's comments came the day after FDA's top vaccine regulator,  Dr. Vinay Prasad , told his team the agency would change its annual flu vaccine framework, update vaccine labels to be \"honest,\" and make other changes to how it reviews vaccines, according to contents of an internal email reviewed by NPR and  reported on first  by a  PBS News Hour  correspondent and  later by   The Washington Post. Prasad wrote that the FDA would also no longer authorize vaccines for pregnant women without stricter requirements. And for pneumonia vaccines, manufacturers will have to prove they reduce disease rather than show they generate antibodies. He also raised questions about giving multiple vaccines at the same time, which is standard practice. The changes could make it much more difficult and expensive for vaccines to get approved, further limiting the availability of vaccines, which are considered among the safest and most effective tools for protecting people against infectious diseases. While all vaccines carry some risks, most public health experts argue the current process for vetting vaccines before marketing has long assured that the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks. Studies required after vaccines are approved and surveillance systems, including the  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System  (VAERS), also flag potential safety issues once vaccines are in use. FDA says an analysis links COVID shots to some deaths Makary said on Fox News that 10 children had died from the COVID shot during the Biden administration, but did not offer specifics about how the FDA came to that conclusion.  Millions of children  have received the vaccine.   Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the COVID analysis and changes to vaccine review standards. According to the FDA email from Prasad, he told the agency's biostatistics and pharmacovigilance team to analyze 96 reported deaths from 2021 to 2024, and they determined 10 children died \"after and because of\" the COVID vaccine. But Prasad said the true number was likely higher. Dr. Paul Offit, who  directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia , said in a text message that Prasad has not shared the evidence that these vaccines killed 10 children. \"Because he doesn't provide any evidence, he is asking us to trust him on an important issue,\" Office said. \"All this will do is scare people unnecessarily. At the very least, he should provide all the evidence he has so that experts in the field can review it and decide whether he has enough data to prove his point.\" Dr. Jesse Goodman,  a professor at Georgetown University  who held Prasad's job at FDA from 2003 until 2009, said in an email that the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine approval, has been \"recognized globally as a gold standard regulator.\" Goodman defended \"immunologic endpoints like antibody levels\" for the accelerated approval of pneumonia and influenza vaccines. He said science supports their use and they are confirmed with studies after approval: \"These approaches have helped provide children and adults with timely access to safe and effective vaccines, saving many lives.\" Michael Osterholm , an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, reviewed the email from Prasad and challenged his statement that \"COVID-19 was never highly lethal for children.\" Osterholm also questioned the FDA's latest analysis of adverse event reports attributing the 10 deaths to COVID vaccines. \"Prasad's email is filled with factual mistakes and misrepresents both the severity of COVID in children (1597 deaths in 2020-2022) and how the US responded to the first signals of possible vaccine-associated pediatric deaths in May 2021,\" Osterholm wrote in an email to NPR. \"While Prasad's email notes 10 such deaths, these cases have never been presented for review by the medical and public health communities or published in the medical literature,\" Osterholm continued. \"Given the record of this Administration to misrepresent scientific data regarding vaccines, until these cases have been reviewed by an expert third party, like the National Academy of Science[s], we can not accept the fact they are vaccine-associated deaths.\" Surveillance system collects vaccines reports The FDA makes public data from the VAERS surveillance system co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But  FDA cautions , \"it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause and effect relationship has been established.\" In his email, Prasad wrote that \"with case reports, causality is typically assessed on a subjective scale. In this scale ranging from certain to unlikely -- certain, possible/likely, and probable are broadly considered as related to the product.\" Makary said on Fox News that when the COVID shot was first rolled out, it was \"amazing\" for people at high risk of coming down with severe disease, but things have changed.  \"Back in 2020, we saw a reduction in the severity of illness and lives saved, but now recommending that a 6-year-old girl get another 70 million COVID shots – one each year for the rest of her life – is not based on science. And so we're not going to just rubber stamp approvals without seeing some scientific evidence.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The claim is the latest move by Trump administration health officials questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and how the government has regulated them. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned vaccines. The FDA  restricted eligibility  for the updated COVID vaccines in August after announcing the agency planned to  require more evidence  about the shots' safety and effectiveness going forward. CDC committee will meet to review vaccine policies The FDA email on vaccine policy comes just before the CDC convenes a crucial  two-day meeting  of that agency's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Dec. 4-5. The committee is in the process of conducting a major review of how children are inoculated against dangerous infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio and hepatitis B. Many public health experts are concerned the committee will upend the childhood vaccination schedule. It could move to delay the timing of some inoculations, space out vaccinations and call for the reformulation of some vaccines. Taken together, the moves could result in fewer children getting protected and the resurgence of once-vanquished diseases. Asked about Makary and Prasad's claims that the COVID vaccine caused deaths among 10 children, Moderna, whose COVID vaccine is approved for children as young as 6 months old, pointed to a  statement it made in September . The company says that multiple published, peer-reviewed studies from a variety of sources show its shot is safe and that it is \"not aware of any deaths in the last year or pertinent new information from prior years.\" Moderna says it monitors its vaccine's safety along with regulators in more than 90 countries. \"With more than one billion doses distributed globally, these systems — including in national health systems across Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. — have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women.\" Pfizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-netanyahu-pardon-5dbc2461b440c8edc8d82d31650cdbe8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"10:50:14+00:00","title":"Netanyahu Asks for Pardon Amid Corruption Trial, Sparking National Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has requested a presidential pardon from corruption charges, becoming the first sitting prime minister in Israel’s history to face a criminal trial.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation. Netanyahu, who has been at war against Israel’s legal system over the charges, said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous change in the region. But it immediately triggered denunciations from opponents, who said a pardon would weaken democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he’s above the rule of law. Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. The president’s office called it an “extraordinary request,” carrying with it “significant implications.” Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial , after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He hasn’t been convicted of anything. Netanyahu rejects the allegations and has described the case as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media, police and judiciary. Trump’s request His request comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament last month. Earlier this month, Trump also sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.” Herzog is a former political rival of Netanyahu, but the men have a good working relationship. Later Sunday, Israeli media reported a small protest outside Herzog’s home, including a pile of bananas with a sign saying a pardon equals a banana republic. In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead. “The continuation of the trial tears us apart from within, stirs up this division, and deepens rifts. I am sure, like many others in the nation, that an immediate conclusion of the trial would greatly help to lower the flames and promote the broad reconciliation that our country so desperately needs,” he said. Case delays Netanyahu has taken the stand multiple times over the past year. But the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led militant attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu’s pardon request consisted of two documents: a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. They’ll be sent to the Justice Ministry for opinions and will then be transferred to the legal adviser at the president’s office, which will formulate additional opinions for the president. Legal experts say the pardon request isn’t able to stop the trial. “It’s impossible,” said Emi Palmor, former director-general of the Justice Ministry. “You cannot claim that you’re innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,” she said. The only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings, she said. In rare cases, the system could pardon Netanyahu. Experts say the president has broad discretion to grant one, and oversight is limited. However, “as a rule, the president reviews a pardon request only after all legal proceedings have ended. The possibility of a preconviction pardon ... is extremely rare,” the Israel Democracy Institute wrote earlier this month. “A pardon before conviction, while legal proceedings are ongoing, threatens the rule of law and seriously undermines the principle of equality before the law.” Netanyahu portrays himself as victim In 2008, as opposition leader, Netanyahu called on then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step down as he faced a growing corruption scandal. At the time, Netanyahu said that a prime minister “up to his neck” in scandal did not have a mandate to lead the country, and there was a risk that Olmert would make decisions that served his personal interests and not those of the nation. Olmert resigned even before he was indicted that year and would later serve 16 months in prison. Netanyahu has struck a different, defiant tone since his own legal problems began. He has portrayed himself as the victim of a “deep state” conspiracy trying to oust him from office. Shortly after forming his current government in late 2022, Netanyahu launched a plan to overhaul Israel’s justice system. Netanyahu presented the plan as a much-needed reform. But his opponents accused him of trying to weaken the justice system, damaging the country’s system of checks and balances and having a conflict of interest at a time when he was on trial. The plan triggered large street protests against the government, and critics have said the deep divisions sent a message of weakness to Israel’s enemies that encouraged Hamas to launch its 2023 attacks. Netanyahu’s request also sparked backlash on Sunday, with an immediate response from the opposition and advocacy groups urging the president not to give in to his request. “You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel said that granting a pardon to a prime minister accused of serious offenses of fraud and breach of trust would send a clear message that there are citizens who are above the law. But some Israelis expressed support for Netanyahu’s request. “Bibi Netanyahu did totally the right thing requesting the pardon,” said Lior Gal, a Jerusalem resident, referring to the prime minister by his nickname. “He deserves to be pardoned. This chapter should be over and to remain united people and carry on.” ___ Josef Federman contributed to this report from Jerusalem."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-99760","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-28","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration pausing all asylum decisions after National Guard shooting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a shooting in Washington, D.C. that killed one National Guard member and injured another, the Trump administration announced a pause on all asylum decisions and initiated a comprehensive review of green cards from countries of concern, including Afghanistan, Chad, Sudan, Somalia, and others.

shooting \n         By Alana Wise \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 28, 2025 • 8:39 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         After an Afghan national was named as being behind a shooting in Washington, D.C., that left  one member of the National Guard dead  and another in critical condition, the Trump administration says it is halting all asylum decisions. Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said Friday night that the agency is pausing decisions \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\" \"The safety of the American people always comes first,\" Edlow  wrote on X. The decision follows President Trump's promise of a sharp crackdown on immigration from countries he described as \"third world.\" Writing on social media on Thursday night, Trump railed against immigrants from impoverished nations, accusing them of being a burden on the nation's welfare system and \"preying\" on natural-born citizens. \"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\" The Trump administration is  already deporting some immigrants,  either to their countries of origin or to third countries, many of which are paid to receive them. Venezuelans were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, a number of migrants were sent to Eswatini and South Sudan, and Rwanda has agreed to accept deportees. Edlow  wrote on social media  Thursday that he had been directed to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.\" He did not say which countries this would entail, and the USCIS did not respond to an NPR request for comment. But a June  White House proclamation  placed a travel ban on 12 countries of concern. These included many African nations suffering from conflict and terrorism such as Chad, Sudan and Somalia — as well as other countries, such as Afghanistan. Another 7 countries were slapped with partial restrictions.  In a  statement to CNN , the Department of Homeland Security said it had already halted all immigration requests stemming from Afghanistan and was in the process of reviewing \"all\" asylum cases approved under former President Biden. The department did not respond to an NPR request for comment. History of anti-immigrant sentiment The president's latest comments against immigration was sparked by the revelation that the alleged shooter was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal — a 29-year-old Afghan national who had worked with the CIA to fight the Taliban in his native country and was admitted into the United States in 2021 as a result of his service. In a Thanksgiving Day call with servicemembers, Trump described the shooting as a terrorist attack and the shooter as a \"savage monster.\" He blamed the Biden administration for Lakanwal's entry to the United States and for a general failure of the immigration system. \"For the most part, we don't want 'em,\" he said, referring broadly to immigration seekers as gang members, mentally ill and previously incarcerated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump ran both successful White House campaigns on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration, targeting at various points migrants from countries including Mexico and Somalia. Speaking to reporters on Thursday after the Thanksgiving call, Trump widened his attack to focus not just on the alleged shooter but to rail against immigration to the U.S. and immigrants in general. When asked by a reporter about the fact that as a former CIA asset, Lakanwal had been vetted, Trump repeatedly berated the reporter as \"stupid.\" Asked by another reporter whether he blamed all Afghans for the alleged actions of one, Trump said: \"No, but there's a lot of problems with Afghans.\" Trump then turned his attention to immigrants from Somalia, who he has repeatedly accused of being gang-affiliated and \"taking over\"   Minnesota — home to the nation's largest Somali community. Questioned about what Somalis had to do with the D.C. shooting, Trump said: \"Nothing.\" But, he added, \"Somalians have caused a lot of trouble.\" . Later on social media, he described \"Somalian gangs\" in Minnesota as \"roving the streets looking for 'prey' as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.\" Officials for the United Nations on Friday criticized Trump's call for sweeping halts to immigration seekers. \"They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process,\" U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5622991","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"14:45:00Z","title":"What Was 'Operation Allies Welcome,' Which Allowed Some Afghans Entry Into the U.S.?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Operation Allies Welcome was a U.S. resettlement program launched in 2021 to protect Afghans who had worked with U.S. forces from Taliban retaliation after the fall of Kabul.

Thursday, November 27, 2025 • 2:45 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan man suspected of  shooting two National Guard members  in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, was in the U.S. after entering the country in 2021 under a program called Operation Allies Welcome. His motives are still unknown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here's a look at why the program was set up and how Afghans who entered the U.S. were vetted. The origins of Operation Allies Welcome When  Kabul fell to the Taliban  in August 2021 there were chaotic scenes as thousands of Afghans rushed to the airport desperate to escape. The world watched in horror as some among them were crushed to death in the crowds trying to flee. The U.S. exit from Afghanistan happened during former President Joe Biden's term, but it was set in motion by the first Trump administration, which  signed a deal with the Taliban  in 2020 to withdraw after two decades in the country. On announcing the end of the war on Aug. 31, 2021, Biden hailed the U.S. evacuation of Afghans as unprecedented and vowed to continue to assist those under threat. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"As for the Afghans, we and our partners have airlifted 100,000 of them,\"  he said in an address.  \"We will continue to work to help more people leave the country who are at risk. And we're far from done.\" Two days before this address he had instructed the Department of Homeland Security to \"lead and coordinate ongoing efforts across the federal government to support vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked alongside us in Afghanistan for the past two decades, as they safely resettle in the United States.\" Those efforts were called  Operation Allies Welcome (OAW).  The program was set up to allow Afghans — especially those who might be targeted by the Taliban for having worked with allied forces in their 20 years in Afghanistan — to enter the U.S. for two years on parole without permanent immigration status. They were expected to then apply for other means to stay in the country, like asylum. About 40% of those who came were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas because of the great risks they took to help the U.S., or were a family member of someone who helped the U.S., according to the Department of Homeland Security. OAW was in place for about one year and then shifted to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans resettled in the U.S. under both programs. How were they vetted? DHS said the Afghans underwent \" rigorous\" vetting  to ensure they did not pose a national security threat. Some 400 personnel across U.S. agencies conducted the checks which involved \"biometric and biographic screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals,\" the agency said. \"This process includes reviewing fingerprints, photos, and other biometric and biographic data for every single Afghan before they are cleared to travel to the United States,\" it said. After arriving in the U.S. the Afghans were further processed at U.S. military bases before being allowed into the community. However, the program did come under some criticism from Republicans who said the Afghans were not all properly vetted. In 2024, the DHS Office of Inspector General  released a report  which admitted to some failings, including data inaccuracies in some of the files of Afghans who came through the program. Another report was released in June this year by the Department of Justice looking at  the FBI's role  in OAW. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"According to the FBI, the need to immediately evacuate Afghans overtook the normal processes required to determine whether individuals attempting to enter the United States pose a threat to national security, which increased the risk that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation,\" the report said. It noted 55 individuals evacuated from Afghanistan under OAW were later identified on terrorism watch lists. For the most part though, the report concluded the FBI had done a good job flagging potential threats and the majority of evacuees were not considered security risks. What's the situation for Afghans now? After Wednesday's shooting of the National Guard members, President Trump railed against OAW on social media, saying: \"We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       CIA Director John Ratcliffe said \"the Biden Administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. Government, including CIA.\" Shortly after the shootings, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  announced  it had stopped processing immigration applications from Afghan nationals. But  tens of thousands  of Afghans are already in limbo. Around the world, over 40,000 Afghans are still actively pursuing resettlement in the U.S., with more than 10,000 approved to relocate by the U.S. government. Hundreds of veterans  have urged the administration not to abandon those who fought alongside the Americans during the war. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/philippines-flood-control-corruption-ferdinand-marcos-jr-578589ef17d66dfd93e0f843f3c7789c","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"05:29:48+00:00","title":"Philippines Protests Over Flood Control Corruption Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major anti-corruption demonstration, thousands of Filipinos, including members of the Roman Catholic Church, protested against widespread graft involving defective flood control projects.

Left-wing groups led a separate protest in Manila’s main park with a blunt demand for all implicated government officials to immediately resign and face prosecution. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been scrambling to quell public outrage over the massive corruption blamed for substandard, defective or non-existent flood control projects across an archipelago long prone to deadly flooding and extreme weather in tropical Asia. More than 17,000 police officers were deployed in metropolitan Manila to secure the separate protests. The Malacanang presidential palace complex in Manila was in a security lockdown with key access roads and bridges blocked by anti-riot police forces, trucks and barbed wire railings. In a deeply divided democracy where two presidents have been separately overthrown in the last 39 years partly over allegations of plunder, there have been isolated calls for the military to withdraw support from the Marcos administration.

Follow on “The unified voice of our retired and active leaders reaffirms that the Armed Forces of the Philippines remains a pillar of stability and a steadfast guardian of democracy,” the military said in a statement. Roman Catholic churches across the country helped lead Sunday’s anti-corruption protests in their districts, with the main daylong rally being held at a pro-democracy “people power” monument along EDSA highway in the capital region. Police said about 5,000 demonstrators mostly wearing white joined before noon. They demanded that members of Congress, officials and construction company owners behind thousands of anomalous flood control projects in recent years be imprisoned and ordered to return the government funds they stole. A protester wore a shirt with a blunt message: “No mercy for the greedy.” “If money is stolen, that’s a crime, but if dignity and lives are taken away, these are sins against fellow human beings, against the country but, most importantly, against God,” said the Rev. Flavie Villanueva , a Catholic priest, who has helped many families of impoverished drug suspects killed under former President Rodrigo Duterte’s crackdowns. “Jail all the corrupt and jail all the killers,” Villanueva told the crowd of protesters. Since Marcos first raised alarm over the flood control anomalies in his state of the nation address before Congress in July, at least seven public works officers have been jailed for illegal use of public funds and other graft charges in one flood control project anomaly alone. Executives of Sunwest Corp., a construction firm involved in the project, were being sought. On Friday, Henry Alcantara, a former government engineer who has acknowledged under oath in Senate inquiry hearings his involvement in the anomalies, returned 110 million pesos ($1.9 million) in kickbacks that justice officials said he stole and promised to return more in a few weeks. About 12 billion pesos ($206 million) worth of assets of suspects in flood control anomalies have been frozen by authorities, Marcos said. Marcos has pledged that many of at least 37 powerful senators, members of Congress and wealthy construction executives implicated in the corruption scandal would be in jail by Christmas . Protesters in Sunday’s rallies said many more officials, including implicated senators and House of Representatives members, should be jailed sooner and ordered to return the funds they stole and used to finance fleets of private jets and luxury cars, mansions and extravagant lifestyles. ___ AP journalists Joeal Calupitan and Aaron Favila contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/f1-norris-piastri-verstappen-qatar-grand-prix-bc6ed73a2fc88ad17eb3ee5aae7946f4","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"17:34:43+00:00","title":"McLaren's Strategic Blunder at Qatar GP Costs Them Points as Verstappen Closes Gap on Norris","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"McLaren suffered a major strategic error at the Qatar GP by staying out during a safety car period, which cost them crucial points and allowed Max Verstappen to gain an advantage.

Red Bull’s Max Verstappen took full advantage of the unexpected gift to clinch a seventh win this season — his 70th overall — as he closed the gap on championship leader Lando Norris from 24 points at the start of the weekend to 12 points, heading into next Sunday’s title decider in Abu Dhabi. McLaren still has two drivers in contention , with Oscar Piastri four points behind Verstappen in third, but must stop the slide. Last Sunday, the two drivers lost a combined 30 points after both were disqualified following the race, won by Verstappen. At the Qatar GP, Norris would have clinched his first F1 title with a win but finished fourth, with Piastri placing second having started from pole position and looking assured. But after an early safety car, McLaren’s decision to keep both drivers out backfired badly as Verstappen effectively benefited from a free tire change in a mandatory two-stop race.

All three title contenders have won seven races. Verstappen is aiming for a fifth straight F1 crown, with Piastri chasing a first title. Norris will become the first British driver to win the championship since Lewis Hamilton clinched his seventh title in 2020 if he finishes at least third in Abu Dhabi even if Verstappen wins the race. McLaren’s gamble backfires Although Verstappen overtook Norris heading into Turn 1, Piastri made a clean start and took a comfortable lead early on. Piastri also said McLaren made an error by staying out following the safety car, which came out after Nico Hulkenberg’s Sauber was sent spinning off the track on Lap 7 after being clipped by Alpine driver Pierre Gasly. “Speechless. I don’t know any words,” Piastri said. “It is a little bit tough to swallow at the moment.” Later, the Australian added: “Clearly we didn’t get it right” and said there would be discussions. The decision played into Verstappen’s hands and the elated Dutchman climbed out of his car and jumped into the arms of his mechanics and engineers after winning. “This was an incredible race for us, we made the right call as a team to box under that safety car,” Verstappen said. “Super happy to win here, we stayed in the fight until the end. Incredible.” The decision to stay out was even more questionable in a race where drivers had to take two pit stops over the 57 laps — a measure imposed on safety grounds due to a high risk of tire degradation at the Lusail International Circuit. Gambling on holding track position left McLaren at risk later on, unless there was another safety car. “It wasn’t the correct decision,” McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said. Because drivers were restricted to a maximum of 25 laps on the Pirelli tires, those who pitted had to change again on Lap 32. After the McLarens made their first tire changes, Norris was in fifth place behind Piastri in fourth. That left Verstappen out in front and with several laps to build his lead. McLaren pitted Piastri again on Lap 43 and Norris soon after, but when Norris came back out on Lap 45 he was fifth with Antonelli and Sainz barring his way. Norris overtook Antonelli right at the end but could not catch Sainz, who finished third. George Russell was sixth for Mercedes, with Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari), Liam Lawson (Racing Bulls) and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) completing the top 10. Hamilton’s dismal run for Ferrari continued with a 12th-placed finish. Aside from clinching a sprint race in China in March, the 40-year-old has not been on the podium all season. Verstappen eyes another Abu Dhabi decider Desert battles seem to suit Verstappen, who clinched a third straight win in Qatar and has won four of the last five races in Abu Dhabi. Norris may take hope from the fact he won there last year. But the McLarens head to Abu Dhabi with a hard-charging Verstappen looking to repeat history by clinching a championship in the last race at Abu Dhabi, having done so when he overtook Hamilton on the final lap after a controversial finish in 2021. “It’s possible now but we will see,” said Verstappen, who had written off his chances earlier this season. “I don’t really worry about it too much.” ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-russia-rubio-witkoff-de0fe08a5f472e130f46aa0bf3338b43","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"05:01:08+00:00","title":"U.S. and Ukraine Hold Talks to End War, With Plans for Moscow Meeting with Putin","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. and Ukrainian officials held high-level talks in Hallandale Beach, Florida, to advance a peace deal ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, with the goal of securing long-term Ukrainian prosperity beyond just ending hostilities.

(AP) — U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war between Russia and Ukraine, just days before a U.S. envoy is due in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters afterward that the session with the Ukrainian team in Florida was productive but work remains in the search for a peace deal. “It’s not just about the terms that ends fighting,” Rubio said. “It’s about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there’s more work to be done.” President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to meet with Putin in Moscow in the next few days. Top Trump administration officials met with Ukrainian negotiators in Florida on Sunday, pushing to broker an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine and setting the stage for key talks planned this week in Moscow with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Rubio, Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, represented the American side in the high-level talks, held at a sensitive time as Ukraine continues to push back against Russian forces that invaded in 2022 while dealing with a corruption scandal. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was briefed by them and that “Ukraine’s got some difficult little problems,” referring to the corruption scandal, which he said was “not helpful.” The president added that “there’s a good chance we can make a deal.” Related Stories Pope Leo XIV doubles down on insistence for 2-state solution to resolve Israeli-Palestinian conflict 3 MIN READ Russian attacks kill 3 as diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine gain momentum 4 MIN READ Zelenskyy’s chief of staff resigns after anti-corruption investigators search home 5 MIN READ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ‘s government has been roiled by fallout from a scandal over $100 million embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors, causing newfound domestic pressures for Zelenskyy. Diplomats have focused on revisions to a proposed U.S.-authored plan that was developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticized as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine. As the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach, Rubio said the goal goes beyond peace to “securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.” Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine’s security council, responded to Rubio by expressing his country’s appreciation for U.S. efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has at times claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for U.S. assistance during the war. “U.S. is hearing us,” Umerov said before the meeting. “U.S. is supporting us. U.S. is working beside us.” Umerov, who appeared with Rubio to deliver a brief statement to reporters after the talks, underscored Ukraine’s gratitude for U.S. support during nearly four-year war. But he offered no hints about what, if any, progress was made during the talks. Rubio said the talks were comprehensive and went beyond finding agreement on ending the fighting. Trump has repeatedly said that if Ukraine builds deeper commercial ties to the United States it can help deter Russian aggression in the future. To that end, the U.S. and Ukraine this spring signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine’s vast mineral resources . Among measures included in Trump’s draft peace proposal is the creation of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centers and artificial intelligence. The proposal also calls for Washington to cooperate with Kyiv to jointly rebuild, develop, modernize and operate Ukraine’s natural gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities. Russia has repeatedly bombarded Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during the war. “We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever, so never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity,” Rubio said. “We want the Ukrainian people to emerge from this war not just to rebuild their country, but to build it back in a way that will be stronger and more prosperous than it’s ever been.” Umerov has been involved in the talks. But until now , Ukraine’s head negotiator had been Andrii Yermak , the powerful chief of staff for Zelenskyy . On Friday, Zelenskyy announced the resignation of Yermak, after his home was searched by anti-corruption investigators. It was only a week ago that Rubio had met with Yermak in Geneva, with each side saying the talks had been positive in putting together a revised peace plan. Among the other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Andrii Hnatov , the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, and presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz. The earlier 28-point plan, which Trump has since played down as a “concept” or a “map” to be “fine-tuned,” would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine’s military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days. Negotiators have indicated the framework has changed, but it’s not clear how its provisions have been altered. It had initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas to Russia — a sticking point for Kyiv. Trump said on Tuesday that he would send Witkoff and perhaps Kushner to Moscow this week to meet with Putin about the plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments published Sunday on Russian state television, said Putin would see Witkoff before Thursday, when Putin departs for India. Both Witkoff and Kushner, like Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza. In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said the American side was “demonstrating a constructive approach.” “In the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,” he said. Attacks continue despite diplomatic efforts to end the war On Saturday, Russian drone and missile attacks in and around Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, killed at least three people and wounded dozens more, officials said. Fresh attacks overnight into Sunday killed one person and wounded 19 others, including four children, local officials said, when a drone hit a nine-story apartment block in the city of Vyshhorod in the Kyiv region. In a post on Telegram Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had attacked Ukraine with 122 strike drones and ballistic missiles. “Such attacks occur daily. This week alone, Russians have used nearly 1,400 strike drones, 1,100 guided aerial bombs and 66 missiles against our people. That is why we must strengthen Ukraine’s resilience every day. Missiles and air defense systems are necessary, and we must also actively work with our partners for peace,” Zelenskyy said. “We need real, reliable solutions that will help end the war,” he added. After Ukraine claimed responsibility for damaging a major oil terminal on Saturday near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, owned by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Kazakhstan told Ukraine on Sunday to stop attacking the Black Sea terminal. The CPC pipeline, which starts in Kazakhstan and ends at the Novorossisyk terminal, handles a large proportion of Kazakhstan’s oil exports. “We view what has occurred as an action harming the bilateral relations of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and we expect the Ukrainian side to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future,” Kazakhstan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ___ Madhani reported from Washington.

Mark Kelly over a video that urges American troops to defy “illegal orders” has raised a slew of questions, and some criticism, from legal experts. Some say the Pentagon is misreading military law to go after Kelly as a retired Navy fighter pilot. Others say the Arizona Democrat cannot be prosecuted as a member of Congress. A group of former military prosecutors insists he did nothing wrong. The Pentagon announced the investigation last week after President Donald Trump’s social media post accusing Kelly — and the five other Democratic lawmakers in the video — of sedition “punishable by DEATH.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kelly was facing investigation because he is the only one in that group who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More ‘It’s not totally unheard of’ Stephen Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, said there has been a “significant uptick” in courts-martial of retired service members in the past decade. While courts have debated the constitutionality, the practice is currently allowed. He said there have been roughly a dozen such prosecutions across the service branches. There are roughly 2 million people who formally retired from the military and receive retirement pay, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service. Service members are generally entitled to retirement pay after completing 20 years of active duty. Todd Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate general, or JAG, said it is rare to prosecute retirees for something that happened after they retired. “It’s not totally unheard of,” said Huntley, who now directs Georgetown’s national security law program. “I actually prosecuted a enlisted guy who had been retired for 16 years. He was sexually assaulting his adopted daughter. Basically no one else had jurisdiction so we prosecuted him.” A ‘ridiculous conclusion’ Colby Vokey, a prominent civilian military lawyer and former military prosecutor, said Hegseth appears to be misreading the Uniform Code of Military Justice to justify the Kelly investigation. Vokey said Hegseth has personal jurisdiction over Kelly because Kelly is entitled to retirement pay. But Vokey said Hegseth lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Kelly made his statements as a senator. Vokey said case law has evolved to where the military can prosecute an active-duty service member for a crime committed off base, such as robbing a convenience store. But applying military law to a retired service member and “assuming that means every offense ever is kind of a ridiculous conclusion.” “Let’s say you have a 100-year-old World War II veteran who is retired with pay and he steals a candy bar,” Vokey said. “Hegseth could bring him back and court-martial him. And that in effect is what is happening with Kelly.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during the 4th annual Northeast Indiana Defense Summit at Purdue University Fort Wayne, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, in Fort Wayne, Ind.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Patrick McLain, a retired Marine Corps judge and former federal prosecutor, said the cases he has seen of retirees being called back “are more like extreme examples of fraud or some of these child pornography cases.” “I’ve not seen anything like the kind of the wackadoodle thing they’re trying to do to Sen. Kelly for essentially exercising his First Amendment right to free speech, which they don’t like,” McLain said. ‘He did it as a civilian’ Charles Dunlap, a Duke University law professor and retired Air Force lawyer, said in an email that military law can restrict speech for service members that is protected for civilians under the First Amendment. But even if the video was found to have violated military law, a key issue may be whether the law can be applied to someone who is retired, Dunlap said. A group of former military lawyers, the Former JAGs Working Group, said in a statement that Kelly did not violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice. “The video simply described the law as it pertains to lawful versus unlawful orders,” the group said. “It did not suborn mutiny or otherwise encourage military members to disregard or disobey lawful orders issued to them.” Troops, especially uniformed commanders, have specific obligations to reject orders that are unlawful. Broad legal precedence also holds that just following orders — colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense,” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler — does not absolve troops. Kelly and the other lawmakers did not mention specific circumstances in the video. Some Democratic lawmakers have questioned the legality of the Trump administration’s attempts to send National Guard troops into U.S. cities. Kelly has pointedly questioned the use of the military to attack alleged drug boats off South America’s coast, saying he was worried about the military officers involved with the mission and whether they were following orders that may have been illegal.

O’Hanlon said it might not have been politically smart to “wave a red flag in front of the bull” but he does not see the legal grounds for a court martial. “Saying that you shouldn’t break the law cannot be a crime,” O’Hanlon said. “But in addition, he did not do it as a military officer. He did it as a civilian.” Separation of powers Kelly’s status as a senator could block the Pentagon’s investigation because of constitutional protections for the separation of powers in the U.S government. The Constitution explicitly shields members of Congress from White House overreach, said Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University. “Having a United States senator subject to discipline at the behest of the secretary of defense and the president — that violates a core principle of legislative independence,” Kreis said in a telephone interview. Kreis said such protections were a reaction to the British monarchy, which arbitrarily punished members of Parliament. ”Any way you cut it, the Constitution is fundamentally structurally designed to prevent this kind of abuse,” Kreis said. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Todd Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate general, said of a veteran Huntley had once prosecuted, “He was sexually assaulting his adopted daughter,” rather than, “He was essentially assaulting his adopted daughter.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/military-strikes-boats-drugs-caribbean-hegseth-congress-93c513e28f38688f5582150c7675c072","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"18:49:28+00:00","title":"Congressional Investigations Spark Over U.S. Military Strikes on Drug Smuggling Vessels in Caribbean Amid Allegations of War Crimes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late November 2025, lawmakers from both parties are calling for congressional oversight of U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, targeting vessels suspected of drug smuggling.

support congressional reviews of U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, citing a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack. The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week’s Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns. “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information that happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations . “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Sunday evening while flying back to Washington from Florida, where he celebrated Thanksgiving, confirmed that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Trump also is weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland. Trump declined to comment on details of the call, which was first reported by The New York Times. “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, when asked about the call. The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the call with Trump. Turner said there are concerns in Congress about the attacks on vessels that the Trump administration says are transporting drugs, but the allegation regarding the Sept. 2 attack “is completely outside anything that has been discussed with Congress and there is an ongoing investigation.” The comments from lawmakers during news show appearances come as the administration escalates a campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. On Saturday, Trump said the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety,” an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Maduro. Maduro’s government accused Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty. After the Post’s report, Hegseth said Friday on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.” “Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,” Hegseth wrote. Trump said on Sunday the administration “will look into” the matter but added, “I wouldn’t have wanted that — not a second strike.” The president also defended Hegseth. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. He added, “And I believe him.” Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.” That was followed Saturday with the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, and the ranking Democratic member, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, issuing a joint statement saying the panel was committed to “providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.” “We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Rogers and Smith said, referring to U.S. Southern Command. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side. “We should get to the truth. I don’t think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that’s a clear violation of the law of war,” Bacon said. “So, I’m very suspicious that he would’ve done something like that because it would go against common sense.” Kaine and Turner appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and Bacon was on ABC’s “This Week.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-holiday-shopping-chatgpt-0722dce44b4a479ec4ce476bbd15dfa9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"10:05:08+00:00","title":"AI-Powered Shopping Tools Roll Out Ahead of Holiday Season","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the holiday shopping season, major retailers and tech companies including Walmart, Amazon, Google, and OpenAI are introducing or expanding AI-powered shopping tools to make gift buying easier.

intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past . The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season’s most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock. San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce’s director of consumer insights.

Despite the advancements, AI’s impact on holiday shopping will be “relatively limited” this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner. “The more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,” Jashinsky said. “But customer behavior takes a long time to change.” Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025: Bypassing the search bar AI’s potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks. OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers’ guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user’s previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for “detail-heavy” items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said. Then there’s Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user’s browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations. Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans, Responses are pulled from Google’s 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed. “This is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,” Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Walmart’s AI shopping assistant , Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target’s app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient. New pricing tools and alerts Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal’s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops. This holiday season, shoppers have new options. Amazon launched a 90-day pricing history tracker this month for virtually everything it sells. Shoppers also now can set up alerts to receive notifications when prices on specific items fall within their budgets. Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment’s size and color. Microsoft’s Copilot also launched a price tracker this year. Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive. “A lot of consumers that weren’t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,” Goldberg predicted. New ways to buy Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer’s website to complete a purchase. OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx. OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart’s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time. A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app. New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, “agentic AI” is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say. Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an “auto buy” button while setting up price alerts. Once a product’s price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said. The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn’t carry a desired item in its store, a “Shop Direct” button will take them to the website of a place that does. Google’s AI Mode price tracker also includes a “buy for me” option that automatically makes a customer’s purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers. Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google’s program discloses to the store that it’s an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said. Google said it’s applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys , health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stockton-california-shooting-b59e32ae53716a0dfe9f28c246552607","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"03:28:47+00:00","title":"Stockton Mass Shooting: Authorities Seek Public Help After Tragedy at Birthday Party","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mass shooting occurred at a birthday party in Stockton, California, on November 29, 2025, killing three children (ages 8, 9, and 14) and an adult (age 21), and injuring 11 people, including one in critical condition.

(AP) — Authorities in California appealed to the public for tips, cellphone video, witness accounts and even rumors as they searched Sunday for a suspect in the killing of three children and an adult during a mass shooting at a child’s birthday party. Someone opened fire at a banquet hall in Stockton where 100 people or more had gathered on Saturday, San Joaquin County Sheriff Patrick Withrow told reporters. He said detectives believe the gunfire continued outside and there may have been multiple shooters. Withrow said the deceased were ages 8, 9, 14 and 21. Eleven people were also wounded, with at least one in critical condition, he said. No one was in custody by Sunday evening, and the sheriff urged anyone with information to contact his office.

The mayor said counselors would be available this week at city schools. Community leaders expressed anguish over the loss of victims so young. “They should be writing their Christmas lists right now. Their parents should be out shopping for them for Christmas. And to think that their lives are over. I can’t even begin to imagine what these families are going through. Breaks my heart,” Fugazi said on Sunday. In 2024, Stockton had many more homicides — 54 — than other California cities of similar size, but the rate was down through October of this year, according to city data. Fugazi on Saturday recalled a shooting several years ago in which “seven people were gunned down” in the city. Withrow said he cut his family’s Thanksgiving celebration short and drove more than eight hours from Oregon to the shooting scene. “I put down my grandbabies, to come hunt down these animals who took somebody else’s babies away from them,” the sheriff said. ____ Weber reported from Los Angeles.

Iranians in the capital and many other cities across the country are breathing in toxic fumes as authorities resort to burning dirty fuel to produce electricity and cope with  multiple ongoing crises .\n\nAt 14 power plants, authorities for years have burned mazut, a dark residue of petroleum high in sulphur and other impurities, whenever they run out of natural gas to feed the electricity generators.\n\nThis happens each year due to what observers call chronic mismanagement and ageing infrastructure. It occurs despite heavily sanctioned Iran having the  world’s second largest proven natural gas reserves  and the third largest crude oil reserves.\n\nThick and suffocating layers of smog blanketed Tehran on Monday even as traffic was light as the country shut down to observe a religious holiday.\n\nFootage taken on Saturday from the nearly 4,000-metre-high (13,000ft-high) Tochal mountain, adjacent to northern Tehran, showed the capital no longer visible beneath the layers of pollutants.\n\nتهران دفن شده در زیر دود و آلودگی، از نمای قله توچال  pic.twitter.com/hpOi8UHtEg\n\n— 🌳 Hadi (@hadinik)  November 22, 2025\n\nThe city of about 10 million has been among the top five most polluted across the world over the past several days, closely trailing Pakistan’s Lahore and India’s New Delhi.\n\nThe pollution index stood at more than 200 early on Monday for a “very unhealthy” classification with a high concentration of PM2.5 airborne particles, which can cause respiratory issues, worsen heart problems and impair lung function, especially for children, the elderly and those with health vulnerabilities.\n\nA “good” index is zero to 50, while a “moderate” is 51 to 100.\n\nState television said Iran’s climate conditions were expected to remain roughly unchanged until the end of the week with hardly any strong wind or rain coming to the rescue. Weather inversions, which trap warmer, smog-filled air close to the surface of the Earth and prevent it from dispersing, are expected to make the situation worse, as do high-emission vehicles and motorcycles.\n\nAir quality has also been rapidly deteriorating in both large and small cities across the country over the past week, further threatening tens of millions of people with dangerous pollutants.\n\nThe Iran Meteorological Organization has issued health warnings for heightened air pollution in Tehran, Karaj, Arak, Isfahan, Tabriz, Mashhad, Ahvaz and Urmia. Schools and offices have been shut down in a number of cities. Authorities in Tehran have yet to announce closures despite the hazardous air.\n\nTo  avoid more crippling power blackouts , the government of President Masoud Pezeshkian continues to burn mazut, as did his predecessors.\n\nA massive 21 million litres (5.55 million gallons) of the dirty chemical product was being burned every single day by mid-November, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency, affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nSpeaking during an exhibition on renewable energy and electricity efficiency in Tehran last week, Energy Minister Abbas Aliabadi confirmed to reporters that power plants will keep burning the heavy fuel oil whenever necessary as winter cold brings more natural gas shortages.\n\n“Mazut-burning power plants are low priority because liquid fuel is valuable and we prefer to use it as a last resort,” he said, without making any mention of the health impacts that using the fuel would entail.\n\nDeputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi told state media this month that 58,975 Iranians had died as a result of breathing in PM2.5 particles during the year that ended in March. That means 161 deaths per day.\n\nThe victims died of heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, strokes and lower respiratory tract infection directly linked with the air pollution, according to the official.\n\nRaisi said the government has estimated costs of air pollution in the year until March at $17.2bn due to healthcare expenses, premature deaths, lost productivity, school closures and business shutdowns.\n\nIn November 2024, Iranian state media had hailed what they called “the government’s brave act” to temporarily stop burning mazut. At the time, government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani called it replacing “producing poison” with “calculated blackouts”.\n\nAs the smog spread across Iran this week, another topic dominating public attention was wildfires that erupted across 8 hectares (20 acres) of forest and mountainous land in the northern provinces.\n\nThe fires threatened UNESCO-listed Hyrcanian forests, considered the oldest temperate forest on earth.\n\nThe ISNA news agency reported the blazes had been largely brought under control as of Monday."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/pope-turkey-lebanon-4a42813fdb443837688cfc9f07956284","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"04:04:19+00:00","title":"Pope Leo XIV Visits Lebanon to Call for Peace and Reconciliation Amid Ongoing Conflict","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV visited Lebanon in November 2025 as part of his first papal journey, arriving from Istanbul to deliver a message of hope and peace amid deep political divisions, economic hardship, and ongoing conflict with Israel.

differences aside, as he sought to give Lebanon’s long-suffering people a message of hope and bolster a crucial Christian community in the Middle East. Leo arrived in Beirut from Istanbul on the second leg of his maiden voyage as pope. He came to encourage the Lebanese people to persevere at a precarious moment for the small Mediterranean country as it faces economic uncertainty, deep political divisions and fears of a new war with Israel. Leo is fulfilling a promise of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who had wanted to visit Lebanon for years but was unable to because of its many crises and as his health worsened. Lebanon’s political system, based on sectarian power-sharing, has been prone to deadlock with lengthy power vacuums and regular stalemates over controversial issues, including the investigation into the deadly 2020 Beirut port explosion. Most recently, the country has been deeply split over calls for Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party, to disarm after fighting a war with Israel last year that left the country deeply damaged.

But he acknowledged the hardships the Lebanese people have endured. “You have suffered greatly from the consequences of an economy that kills, from global instability that has devastating repercussions also in the Levant, and from the radicalization of identities and conflicts,” Leo said. “But you have always wanted, and known how, to start again.” He told Lebanese leaders to seek the truth and engage in a process of reconciliation with “those who have suffered wrongs and injustice” if they truly want to be considered peacemakers. A culture of reconciliation, he said, must come from the top with leaders willing to put their personal interests aside and “recognize the common good as superior to the particular.” The highlight of Leo’s Lebanese visit will come on Tuesday, his last day, when he spends time in silent prayer at the site of the Aug. 4, 2020, port blast , which killed more than 200 people and did billions of dollars in damage. For many people, Leo’s mere presence was a message. “It shows that Lebanon is not forgotten,” said Bishop George, archbishop of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut. Heavy security for pope’s arrival At the Beirut airport, where his plane landed with a Lebanese military jet escort, Leo was greeted first by President Joseph Aoun, then by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. He moved through the streets of the Lebanese capital in a closed popemobile, a return to the past after Pope Francis eschewed closed popemobiles. Lebanese troops deployed on both sides of the road and a helicopter flew overhead. The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, had declined to discuss the types of vehicles Leo would use in Lebanon, and whether they would be bulletproofed. The visit came just a week after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed five people, including a top Hezbollah official. As the convoy reached the entrance of the presidential palace, a dance troupe performed dabke, a traditional Arab folk dance, under heavy rain. A visit meant to give hope In Turkey, Leo marked an important Christian anniversary . In Lebanon, Leo was seeking to encourage Lebanese who believe their leaders have failed them, and to call on Lebanese Christians to stay or, if they have already moved abroad, to come home. A Muslim-majority country where about a third of the population is Christian, Lebanon has always been a priority for the Vatican, a bulwark for Christians throughout the region. After years of conflict, Christian communities that date from the time of the Apostles have shrunk as families have moved abroad for safety and better lives. In his welcome speech, Leo said “much good can come” from the Lebanese diaspora. “However, we must not forget that remaining in our homeland and working day by day to develop a civilization of love and peace remains something very valuable,” he said. Aoun, Lebanon’s Maronite Christian president, vowed that Christians will remain. “Lebanon is a homeland of freedom for every human being,” Aoun said. “Your Holiness, tell the world that we will not die. We will not leave, we will not despair, and we will not surrender.” Lebanon’s ongoing conflict with Israel Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire last year that nominally ended a two-month war between Israel and Hezbollah, Israel continues to launch near-daily airstrikes that it says aim to stop the militant group from rebuilding. The war killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and caused widespread destruction. The pope “is coming to bless us and for the sake of peace,” said Farah Saadeh, a Beirut resident walking on the city’s seaside promenade. “We hope nothing is going to happen after his departure.” Before Leo’s arrival, Hezbollah urged the pope to express his “rejection to injustice and aggression” that the country is being subjected to, referring to the Israeli strikes. The group also urged its supporters to line up along the papal convoy route. Hundreds of them did so, waving the flags of Lebanon and the Vatican. Mounir Younes, the leader of a Hezbollah-affiliated scout troupe, said they aimed to send a message about “the importance of coexistence and national unity.” “Muslim-Christian coexistence is a great wealth that we must hold onto,” he said. Hezbollah — a primarily Shiite group — has allied with several Christian political groups in the country, including the Free Patriotic Movement and Marada Movement. However, the Christian party with the largest parliamentary bloc, the Lebanese Forces, is an opponent of Hezbollah and has criticized the group for pulling the country into a war with Israel. The country is now deeply divided over calls for the group to disarm. Syrian Christians coming In neighboring Syria, hundreds of thousands of Christians fled during the country’s 14 years of civil war. A delegation of some 300 Syrian Christians traveled to Lebanon to join a meeting between Leo and youth groups and pray in a public Mass on Beirut’s waterfront. “We are in need of someone like the pope to come and give us hope as Christians” at a time of “fear of an unknown future,” said 24-year-old Dima Awwad, one of the delegation members. “We wish that the pope would come to visit Syria as he visited Lebanon, to reassure the people and to feel that we are present as eastern Christians and that we need to be in this place.” ___ Associated Press writers Kareem Chehayeb, Bassem Mroue and Ali Sharafeddine in Beirut contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.\n\nThe study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than 2 million teenage girls and women less than age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal  contraception  remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation.\n\nIn addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.\n\nIt was published online on October 30 in JAMA Oncology.\n\nDoctors say these study results won’t change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.\n\nStill, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.\n\nCase in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24 percent higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn’t. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year – about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.\n\nCo-authors Asa Johansson and Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.\n\nRachel Fey, interim co-CEO of Power to Decide – a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods – said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media.\n\n“I get really angry at this because it’s designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,” she said. “It’s really frustrating … especially when it’s given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they’re talking about providing that context.”\n\nThe researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel – found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea – but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo‑Provera.\n\nSome experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumours, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.\n\n“A substantial proportion of the ‘cases’ would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,” said Lina S Morch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. Morch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.\n\nEven as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasise that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: That hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman’s needs and values.\n\nKatharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won’t change how she talks to her patients.\n\n“When counselling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what’s important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),” White wrote in an email. “Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counselling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.”\n\nOther doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.\n\nEleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, “For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,” referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.\n\nMary Rosser, director of Integrated Women’s Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn’t change their advice yet.\n\nJohansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. “It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,” they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.\n\nHormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. Morch noted that even small risks are worth discussing, but said decisions should be guided by women’s “values and preferences”.\n\nWhite said it’s important to see the big picture. “The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85 percent for people who do not use contraception – so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,” she wrote.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that partners with PolitiFact and produces in-depth journalism about health issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"3011-12-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A global roundup of recent events includes rising military spending and arms production profitability in 2024, particularly in Israel and among US and European tech and defense companies.

devastated areas submerged by  cyclone-driven torrential rain  over the past week, as authorities said the death toll has now reached 303 and would likely continue to rise.\n\nIndonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (known as the BNPB) said on Saturday that the number of confirmed casualties following this week’s catastrophic flooding and landslides now stands at 303, with more than 100 people still missing, after rescuers in West Sumatra’s Agam district recovered more bodies.\n\nMore than 500 people have also been injured, the BNPB said.\n\n“The death toll is believed to be increasing, since many bodies are still missing, while many have not been reached,” said Suharyanto, head of the BNPB, who, like many Indonesians, only uses one name.\n\nUpdating an initial death toll of 23 for the whole province of Sumatra, West Sumatra Regional Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Ilham Wahab said late on Friday that 61 people had died and 90 were missing.\n\n“A total of 75,219 people have been displaced, and a total of 106,806 people have been affected throughout West Sumatra,” Ilham said.\n\nA further 116 people were later confirmed killed in North Sumatra, while in Aceh province the death toll had reached at least 35 people, according to figures released by authorities.\n\nSwaths of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have been inundated with days of torrential rain – killing about 400 people across the three countries in total – after a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\n\nAt least  145 people were confirmed killed  across Thailand’s eight southern provinces as of late Friday, while more than 3.5 million people have also been affected by floodwaters. Two people have been killed in neighbouring Malaysia.\n\nWhile the torrential rain finally let up late on Friday, in Indonesia, many people remain missing and thousands of families have been displaced.\n\nThe heavy downpours caused rivers to burst their banks in Indonesia’s North Sumatra province, with the deluge tearing through mountainside villages, sweeping people away and submerging thousands of homes and buildings.\n\nBadly hit areas have been largely cut off from rescue teams by damaged roads and downed communications lines, with relief efforts also hampered by collapsed bridges, flooded roads and a lack of heavy moving equipment.\n\nRelief aircraft continue to work to deliver aid and supplies to the hard-hit district of Central Tapanuli in North Sumatra province and others in the region."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/27/more-than-40-killed-as-heavy-rains-trigger-floods-in-sri-lanka","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-27","timeOfPublication":"19:50:14+00:00","title":"More than 40 people killed as heavy rains trigger floods in Sri Lanka","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains in Sri Lanka have triggered deadly landslides and floods, resulting in more than 40 deaths, with 25 of them in the mountainous tea regions of Badulla and Nuwara Eliya.

Yuyun Karseno, an official at the agency’s North Sumatra division, told the Reuters news agency, adding that communications and power had been cut off.\n\n“There is no more access, due to a total

surge across Southeast Asia\n\nThe death toll from floods and landslides on the  western Indonesian island of Sumatra  this week has risen to 174, a disaster official said, with about 80 more people still missing, as a punishing tropical storm system and heavy monsoon rains have battered the region.\n\n“As of this afternoon, we have recorded that for the entire North Sumatra province, there have been 116 deaths and 42 people are still being searched for,” National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) chief Suharyanto announced on Friday.\n\nHe said another 35 were killed in the island’s Aceh province and another 23 in West Sumatra.\n\nWhile the rain had stopped, 79 people were still missing and thousands of families were displaced, he added.\n\nResidents in Sumatra’s Padang Pariaman region, where a total of 22 people died, had to cope with water levels at least 1 metre (3.3ft) high, and had still not been reached by search and rescue personnel on Friday.\n\nIn the town of Batang Toru, in northern Sumatra, residents on Friday buried seven unclaimed victims in a mass grave. The decomposing bodies, wrapped in black plastic, were lifted from the back of a truck onto a wide plot of land as onlookers covered their noses.\n\nCommunications remained down in some parts of the island, and authorities were working to restore power and clear roads blocked by landslide debris, said Abdul Muhari, spokesman for Indonesia’s national disaster mitigation agency.\n\nIndonesia would continue to airlift aid and rescue personnel into stricken areas on Friday, he added.\n\nIn Indonesia’s West Sumatra province, 53-year-old Misniati described a terrifying battle against rising floodwaters to reach her husband at home.\n\nShe said that, returning from early morning prayers at a mosque, “I noticed the street was flooded.\n\n“I tried to run back to my house to tell my husband, and the water was already reaching my waist,” she told the AFP news agency, adding that it was up to her chest by the time she reached home.\n\nMeanwhile, in Thailand, the government said  145 people had been killed by floods  across eight southern provinces. It said a total of more than 3.5 million people had been affected.\n\nIn the southern city of Hat Yai, the hardest-hit part of Thailand, the rain had finally stopped on Friday, but residents were still ankle-deep in floodwaters, and many remained without electricity as they assessed the damage to their property over the last week.\n\nSome residents said they were spared the worst of the floods but were still suffering from their effects.\n\nIn neighbouring Malaysia, where two people have been confirmed dead, tropical storm Senyar made landfall at about midnight and has since weakened.\n\nMeteorological authorities are still bracing themselves for heavy rain and wind, and warned that rough seas could pose risks for small boats.\n\nA total of 30,000 evacuees remain in shelters, down from more than 34,000 on Thursday.\n\nMalaysia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that it had already evacuated 1,459 Malaysian nationals stranded in more than 25 flood-hit hotels in Thailand, adding that it would work to rescue the remaining 300 still caught up in flood zones.\n\nSeparately, at least  56 people were killed by a cyclone  in the South Asian island nation of Sri Lanka, authorities said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/30/armed-men-kidnap-13-women-in-nigerias-latest-abduction","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"22:27:17Z","title":"Armed men kidnap 13 women in Nigeria’s latest abduction","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent overnight raid in Chacho village, Sokoto State, northeastern Nigeria, armed bandits abducted 13 women and an infant, including a bride and 10 bridesmaids.

Scientists unlock brain’s five eras\n\nA new study has found that adolescence can continue until the age of 32, as humans hit four major “turning points” in brain development at the ages of about nine, 32, 66 and 83.\n\nPublished on Tuesday in the journal, Nature Communications, the study examined nearly 4,000 scans of the brains of participants ranging in age up to 90.\n\nResearchers mapped out the brain’s development using this data and discovered that humans go through five “brain phases” – and within them, four significant life turning points as they grow, mature and decline.\n\nImportantly, they discovered, it is not until age 32 that human personality and intelligence “plateau” and stabilise following changes in early adolescence.\n\nAccording to the study, brain development and ageing undergo five separate phases:\n\nAs the brain adapts to new surroundings and situations between birth and old age, researchers found that four ages – nine, 32, 66 and 83 – were the most pivotal in the brain’s development.\n\nThe shifts are characterised by developments such as puberty, personality stabilisation, “reorganisation” and decline.\n\nIn detail, these are as follows:\n\nDuring this period, the grey and white matter of the brain rapidly grow.\n\nAccording to information from United States-based Johns Hopkins Medicine, while grey matter primarily processes and interprets information, white matter transmits that information to other parts of the nervous system.\n\n“In the brain, grey matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath,” Johns Hopkins says. “In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: the white matter is on the outside, and the grey matter sits within.”\n\nAccording to the authors of the new study: “The first few years of life are marked by consolidation and competitive elimination of synapses [the junctions where neurons meet and communicate with each other] and rapid increases in grey and white matter volume.”\n\n“This age also aligns with the onset of puberty, which begins between eight and 13 years old for females and nine and 14 years old for males, marking the initiation of significant alterations in hormone expression and robust neurological changes,” it added.\n\nThe report also found that the shift to adolescence introduced an “increased risk” of mental health, cognitive and behavioural disorders due to changes in hormones and a “neurobiological shift”.\n\nPreviously, it was accepted that adolescence begins with puberty and ends before the age of 20. However, the study found that while adolescence certainly begins with puberty, its ending point is less clear.\n\n“The transition to adulthood is influenced by cultural, historical and social factors, making it context-dependent rather than a purely biological shift,” the researchers found.\n\n“Our findings suggest that in Western countries (ie, the United Kingdom and United States of America), adolescent topological development extends to around 32 years old, before brain networks begin a new trajectory of topological development,” they added.\n\nThe study found that by age 32 in Western countries, the brain experiences the “most directional changes and a large shift in trajectory” compared with other turning points in life, as this is when white matter integrity and volume in the brain are increasing rapidly.\n\nThe authors did not suggest a reason for this being the case in Western countries, and did not elaborate on how adolescence continues in people in other regions of the world.\n\nThe study found that while brain development rapidly accelerates during the first two phases of life, in adulthood – the longest phase – there are no major turning points until the 60s, as the brain develops more slowly.\n\n“This period of network stability also corresponds with a plateau in intelligence and personality,” it found.\n\nWhile the brain does not show any abrupt signs of decline during this phase, shifts in the patterns of connection in the brain do occur due to a decrease in white matter integrity.\n\nThe brain now works more independently in separate regions, coordinating less as a single whole.\n\nThe early 60s mark an important shift in health and cognition, with the onset of dementia and elevated blood pressure for many, both of which can accelerate brain ageing.\n\nWhile there is less data on this era of the brain’s progression than the other phases due to a low sample size, the study’s findings correlated with a declining trend in brain connectivity, the authors said.\n\n“Therefore, this could reflect a true weakening relationship between age and structural brain topology in late life,” they added.\n\nThe new research into the period of adolescence is the most significant finding from the report.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, adolescence ranges from 10 to 19 years of age. In 2018, a report in The Lancet medical journal found that adolescence ended in the 20s.\n\nBut Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge University in England and one of the authors of the study, told The Independent newspaper that the new report helps us better understand the brain’s vulnerabilities.\n\n“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/26/indonesia-floods-and-landslides-leave-dozens-dead-and-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-26","timeOfPublication":"07:20:22+00:00","title":"At least 17 people killed in Indonesia floods, landslides","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Torrential monsoon rains across Indonesia's Sumatra island triggered deadly floods and landslides, killing at least 17 people and leaving dozens missing.

2025-11-30T16:04:40+00:00\n\nTitle: Is US President Donald Trump preparing to strike Venezuela?\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump  declared  on Saturday that Venezuelan airspace had been “closed”, without offering any further details, spiking tensions between Washington and Caracas amid months of military build-up in the Caribbean.\n\nVenezuela has accused the US of a “colonialist threat” in Latin America, as millions of people in the country remain on edge. President Nicolas Maduro had earlier warned that Washington was fabricating claims as a pretext to justify military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela has been conducting regular drills over the past few weeks and has announced a large-scale mobilisation in preparation for any possible attack.\n\nThe Trump administration has deployed massive naval assets in the Southern Caribbean since launching a series of strikes on alleged drug boats in early September. Washington has not provided any proof that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking. At least 83 people have been killed in those attacks.\n\nRamping up pressure on Maduro last week, Washington designated what is known among Venezuelans as the Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns in English, as a “foreign terrorist organization”.\n\nThe Trump administration says it is targeting Venezuela as part of a push to combat drug trafficking. However, political analysts and human rights observers warn Washington against laying the groundwork to unlawfully remove Maduro from power.\n\nSo, will Trump strike Venezuela after announcing the closure of Venezuelan airspace? Can the US military action be legally justified? And what is driving Trump’s hostile policy against Maduro?\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has ramped up rhetoric against Maduro, blaming Caracas for drug trafficking and the flow of immigrants from Venezuela.\n\nWithin a few weeks into his second term, Trump nixed Venezuelan oil concessions granted by his predecessor, Joe Biden, imposed 25 percent tariffs on countries buying oil from Venezuela, and doubled the reward for the arrest of Maduro to $50m, designating him a “global terrorist leader”.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump confirmed that he has authorised the CIA to carry out secret operations in Venezuela, as his administration deployed the world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford, other warships, thousands of troops, and F-35 stealth jets to the Caribbean.\n\nLast Thursday, Trump said land strikes inside the country could come imminently.\n\nAmid heightened military tensions, Trump reportedly spoke with Maduro last week, as per reporting by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, before sanctions against Cartel de los Soles came into effect.\n\nOn November 25, Trump, on board Air Force One, was asked by reporters if he planned on speaking with Maduro. “I might talk to him. We’ll see. But we’re discussing that with the different staffs. We might talk,” Trump told reporters.\n\nWhen asked why Trump wants to talk to a leader of the designated “foreign terrorist organization”, he took the moral high ground.\n\n“If we can save lives, we can do things the easy way, that’s fine. And if we have to do it the hard way, that’s fine, too,” he replied.\n\nCritics of the Trump administration have argued that the administration’s military actions violate the US Constitution in addition to international laws. Rights observers and legal scholars have said the deadly boat strikes amount to “extrajudicial killing” and violation of human rights.\n\nA  report  in The Washington Post says that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to kill all the passengers on board a boat suspected of carrying drugs.\n\nHegseth has rejected allegations, calling the report “fake news”. The “fabricated and inflammatory” report, he said, was aimed at “discrediting our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland”.\n\nThe defence secretary has said the strikes in the Caribbean are “lawful”.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Congress on Saturday ordered an inquiry into the incident. “At this point, I would call them extrajudicial killings,” Republican Senator Rand Paul told Fox News Sunday in October.\n\nBruce Fein, a US constitutional expert, concurred with Paul.\n\n“Trump is acting extra-constitutionally and committing murder,” said Fein, who served as associate deputy attorney general under Republican President Ronald Reagan.\n\n“Only Congress can authorise the offensive use of the military,” said Fein, adding that Trump’s executive orders in this matter do not have a legal standing. “The victims are engaged in warfare against the United States, except in Trump’s fantasyland – a page from George Orwell’s 1984.”\n\nBy designating the Cartel de los Soles, which now Washington equates with the Venezuelan state, as a “foreign terrorist organization”, the Trump administration is posing that this is no longer a war between two nations that requires congressional declaration, but a counterterrorism operation against a non-state actor.\n\nCartel de los Soles emerged in the 1990s when Venezuelan generals and senior officers were investigated for drug trafficking and related crimes. In Venezuela, it is not a cartel, but rather a common reference to military officers and officials involved in corruption and other illegal activities.\n\nCaracas has denounced Trump’s announcement that effectively closed the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that Trump’s statement sought “to affect the sovereignty of [Venezuelan] airspace, constituting yet another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people”.\n\nMeanwhile, Maduro, whose win in July’s election was not recognised by Washington, has called for peace, rejecting war, and advocated for harmony as he continues to appear frequently on state television broadcasts. In a mix of Spanish and English, Maduro declared, “No war … Yes peace, forever.”\n\nOn November 15, Maduro invoked singer John Lennon’s peace anthem “Imagine” during a rally of supporters. “Do everything for peace, as John Lennon used to say. Imagine all the people,” he said.\n\nTwo days later, condemning the use of force or military threats, Maduro said, “Dialogue, call, yes. Peace, yes. War, no. Never, never war.”\n\nBut as tensions continue to escalate, Maduro last week pledged to defend the country against any “imperialist threat”. He addressed a crowd at the Fuerte Tiuna military academy, in full martial dress, waving a sword that belonged to Simon Bolivar, Venezuela’s national hero.\n\nForeign policy analysts argue that Trump’s aggressive policies towards the Venezuelan government are rooted in Caracas’s oil holdings, the world’s largest proven reserves, and to establish US supremacy in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nSalvador Santino Regilme, a political scientist who leads the international relations programme at Leiden University, said Washington wants Venezuela to align firmly with US strategic preferences instead of China, Russia, or Iran.\n\nVenezuela was seen as a reliable Cold War ally of the US during the 1970s. But when the founder of the governing United Socialist Party and former president, Hugo Chavez, was elected in 1998, relations with Washington began to sour.\n\nAfter a failed coup attempt in 2002, Chavez ended cooperation with the US drug enforcement agencies and expelled US military advisers. He also pushed out US oil majors ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips after nationalising the oil sector, further straining the ties. Chevron, another US oil giant, still operates in Venezuela.\n\nChavez was critical of the US involvement in Latin America and cultivated ties with regional left-leaning countries such as Cuba and Bolivia under former socialist President Evo Morales. He also forged closer economic ties with Russia and China.\n\nAfter Maduro took over from Chavez in 2013, relations worsened. During his first term, Trump backed Maduro’s political rivals, recognising opposition figure Juan Guaido as interim president in 2019.\n\nThe US’s so-called “war on drugs” here functions as a political technology that strips alleged traffickers and small-boat crews of their humanity, argued Regilme, “so that lethal force and regime change look like law enforcement rather than war”.\n\nTrump’s administration also frames Maduro’s state as a criminal syndicate “to delegitimise not just the regime but the entire political-economic model that resists this kind of restructuring”, said Regilme.\n\nAdolfo Franco, a lawyer and Republican strategist, told Al Jazeera that while Trump has not explicitly laid out the next steps, he clearly wants regime change in Venezuela.\n\n“For President Trump, everything is on the table. The desire here, from my experience in government, is forcing Maduro to exit, either peacefully, which I think might be a tall order,” Franco said.\n\n“The negotiation part is difficult because of the massive amount of forces and signals we have sent in the region that we’re serious about some affirmative change in Venezuela,” he added. “I can’t imagine it being business as usual with Maduro running the Venezuelan government. That is not on the table.”\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed the narrative of linking Venezuela to “narco-terrorist” networks. But the fentanyl crisis that claims the most American lives has hardly any connection to Caracas.\n\nUS Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of State data consistently identify Mexico, specifically the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, as the manufacturing hub for synthetic opioids, utilising precursors imported from China.\n\nVenezuela does not even serve as a significant transit corridor for the drug that overwhelmingly enters the US through legal ports of entry, along the southwest land border rather than via the Caribbean maritime routes currently being targeted by the US Navy.\n\nFor cocaine, while Venezuela appears to be a transit hub, it is neither the primary producer nor the dominant trafficking actor.\n\nColombia remains the world’s leading cultivator of the drug. Most of the cocaine that passes through Venezuela goes to Europe.\n\nIn March 2020, the US estimated between 200 and 250 tonnes of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela each year, representing 13 percent of the estimated global production.\n\nThe US allies in Europe have also pushed back against the Trump administration’s strikes in the Caribbean.\n\nAt a Group of Seven foreign ministers’ meeting in Canada’s Niagara region, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the strikes “violate international law” and were concerning France’s territories in the wider region.\n\nUS State Secretary Marco Rubio was present at the meeting. Before departing, he told reporters that drugs are also shipped via Venezuela to Europe, so the US should be thanked for killing the alleged smugglers.\n\n“I don’t think that the European Union gets to determine what international law is,” Rubio said. “They certainly don’t get to determine how the United States defends its national security.”\n\nColombia has been vocal against the US actions as a conflict would impact the country, which shares a 2,219km-long (1,378-mile) border with Venezuela. Bogota already hosts millions of Venezuelan refugees who have fled the country due to a debilitating economic and political crisis.\n\nLeft-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who refused to recognise Maduro’s re-election in January, has effectively severed security cooperation with the US over the strikes on boats.\n\nPetro has described Trump as a “barbarian” who “wants to frighten us” in interviews in the US media. He has called the US military build-up in the Caribbean “undoubtedly an aggression against Latin America”.\n\nBrazil’s President Lula da Silva has taken a more diplomatic but equally firm stance, telling reporters in Johannesburg, South Africa, “no president of another country should make assumptions about what Venezuela … will be like”.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov condemned the US strikes as “unacceptable” in televised remarks, adding, “This is how, in general, lawless countries act, as well as those who consider themselves above the law.”\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, in a late November letter to Maduro, reaffirmed the two nations as “intimate friends, dear brothers, and good partners”, saying “China resolutely opposes the meddling of external forces in Venezuela’s internal affairs under any pretext”.\n\nTrump returned to power this year, rising on a pledge to avoid “forever wars”, a message that appeared to resonate deeply with his Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign.\n\nMany in his camp are sceptical of extended military engagements abroad, viewing them as costly distractions from domestic priorities and a drain on US resources. That fear was central to the debate when the US bombed Iran earlier this year amid tensions between Tehran and Israel.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most vocal faces of MAGA, had a public falling-out with Trump over his administration’s focus on foreign conflicts at the expense of the pressing economic issues, including the cost-of-living crisis, facing Americans. She has since decided to step down from Congress.\n\nHowever, some MAGA-aligned voices have backed pressuring Venezuela’s government by sanctions or low-scale operations amid public opinion against any military intervention in the country.\n\nRubio, who is also the national security adviser, has pushed for a tough policy against Venezuela – an agenda that serves his support base in Florida, home to a significant population of Cuban and Venezuelan immigrants.\n\nConfronting an “authoritarian socialist narco-regime” plays well domestically for Trump as well, said Regilme, the foreign policy expert, adding that it ties “together anticommunism, border security, and the promise to be tough on crime”.\n\nFor Trump, Regilme argued, a kinetic strike on Venezuela is both a bargaining tool and a real option.\n\n“That’s precisely what makes it so dangerous,” he said. “Trump has little appetite for large-scale occupations, but he has repeatedly embraced highly visible uses of force that send a clear message to domestic audiences and foreign elites while limiting US casualties.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/30/netanyahu-writes-to-israeli-president-requesting-pardon-in-corruption-cases","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"10:32:29Z","title":"Israel’s Netanyahu urges president to pardon corruption cases","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the only sitting Israeli PM to face corruption trials, has formally requested a pardon from President Isaac Herzog, citing national security and political divisions.

Israel’s Netanyahu urges president to pardon corruption cases\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accused in long-running corruption cases, has submitted a formal pardon request to President Isaac Herzog.\n\n“The Office of the President is aware that this is an extraordinary request which carries with it significant implications. After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the president will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,” Herzog’s office said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nNetanyahu is up against three separate cases of corruption filed in 2019, which include allegations of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty.\n\n“The trial in my case has been ongoing for nearly six years, and is expected to continue for many more years,” Netanyahu said in a video statement.\n\nHe said he wanted to see through the process until acquittal, “but the security and political reality – the national interest – dictate otherwise. The state of Israel is facing enormous challenges”.\n\n“The continuation of the trial is tearing us apart from within, arousing fierce divisions, intensifying rifts,” he added.\n\nNetanyahu’s request came as United States President Donald Trump  pushed  Herzog to pardon Netanyahu in the cases in question. Herzog also received a  letter  from Trump earlier in November, urging him to consider the pardon.\n\nDuring his address to the Israeli parliament in October, Trump  urged Herzog to pardon Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is also wanted by The Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC). In November 2024, the ICC issued  arrest warrants  for Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial after being charged with fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in three separate cases, accusing him of exchanging favours with wealthy political supporters.\n\nThe premier and his wife Sara are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery, and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours.\n\nHe is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.\n\nDespite the largely ceremonial role of the Israeli presidency, Herzog has the authority to pardon convicted criminals under unusual circumstances.\n\nHowever, Netanyahu’s trial, which began in 2020, has yet to conclude.\n\nNetanyahu’s request consisted of two documents – a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by the prime minister. The documents will be sent to the Ministry of Justice for opinions and will then be transferred to the legal adviser in the president’s office, who will formulate additional opinions for the president.\n\nLegal experts say the pardon request will not stop the trial.\n\n“It’s impossible,” said Emi Palmor, former director general of the justice ministry. “You cannot claim that you’re innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene.”\n\nThe only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings, she added.\n\nNetanyahu’s request sparked an immediate response from the opposition, which urged the president not to give in to his request.\n\n“You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,” said opposition leader Yair Lapid.\n\nYair Golan, head of the left-wing opposition party The Democrats, echoed the allegation. “Only the guilty seek pardon,” he wrote on X."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/30/israel-attacks-on-syria-what-happened-who-did-israel-claim-it-was-after","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00+00:00","title":"Israel attacks on Syria: What happened, who did Israel claim it was after?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a deadly air raid on the Damascus countryside town of Beit Jinn, Israel killed at least 13 people, including two children, after a failed ground incursion by its 55th Reserve Brigade.

Israel attacks on Syria: What happened, who did Israel claim it was after?\n\nOn Friday,  Israel killed at least 13 people , including two children, in the Damascus countryside town of Beit Jinn.\n\nThe latest air raids came after locals tried to repel an Israeli military incursion into Beit Jinn, leading to clashes.\n\nIsrael claimed it was going after members of the Jamaa al-Islamiya, Lebanon’s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nHowever, rubbishing the Israeli claim, the group said it was not active outside Lebanon.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the attack in Beit Jinn and the context behind it.\n\nThe Israeli army’s 55th Reserve Brigade raided Beit Jinn in the early hours of Friday morning, ostensibly to take three Syrians who live there, claiming they were members of Jamaa al-Islamiya and that they posed a “danger to Israel”.\n\nHowever, the incursion did not go to plan. Locals resisted, and six Israeli soldiers were wounded in the resulting clashes, three of them seriously, according to the Israeli army.\n\nIsrael then sent in its warplanes.\n\n“We were asleep when we were woken up at three in the morning by gunfire,” Iyad Daher, a wounded resident, told the AFP news agency from al-Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus.\n\n“We went outside to see what was happening and saw the Israeli army in the village, soldiers and tanks,” Daher said. “Then they withdrew, the air force came – and the shells started falling.”\n\nThis was the deadliest of Israel’s more than 1,000 strikes on Syria since the fall of the Assad regime\n\nThis was not the first time Israel raided Syrian territory.\n\nIsraeli officials and government-aligned media say Israel can no longer respect its enemies’ borders or allow “hostile” groups along its borders after the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, and Israel has sought to use force in other countries to create buffer zones around itself, in the  Gaza Strip , Syria and  Lebanon .\n\nSince the fall of the Assad regime last December, Israel has launched frequent air raids across Syria and ground incursions in its south. It set up numerous checkpoints in Syria and detained and disappeared Syrian citizens from Syrian territory, holding them illegally in Israel.\n\nIt invaded the buffer zone that separated the two countries since they signed the 1974 disengagement agreement, setting up outposts around Jabal al-Sheikh (Mount Hermon in English).\n\nThe new Syrian government, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, said it would abide by the 1974 agreement.\n\nIsrael occupied the Syrian Golan Heights in 1967. A demilitarised zone was later established, but when President Bashar al-Assad was ousted, and his army was in shambles, Israel invaded to take outposts on Syrian-controlled land.\n\nThat the attack is a war crime.\n\nThe Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement, condemning “the criminal attack carried out by an Israeli occupation army patrol in Beit Jinn. The occupation forces’ targeting of the town of Beit Jinn with brutal and deliberate shelling, following their failed incursion, constitutes a full-fledged war crime.”\n\nIsrael’s public broadcaster said the operation was an “arrest raid” targeting Jamaa al-Islamiya members.\n\nAn Israeli army spokesperson said three people linked to the group were “arrested”.\n\nIsrael claims the group is operating in southern Syria to “recruit terrorists” and plays a role in what it calls the “northern front” – Israel’s northern border with Lebanon.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid reported from Syria that Israel has yet to offer any proof of the claim that the people it was after were involved with the group.\n\nThe group is the Lebanese branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIt was founded in 1956 and has a stable presence in Lebanon, though it has never been as popular as some of its regional counterparts.\n\nIt has one member of parliament and was historically aligned with the Future Movement, founded by former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.\n\nHowever, the group moved closer to Iran and Hezbollah politically in recent years. Its armed wing, the Fajr Forces, took part in some operations against Israel in 2023-24.\n\nAfter Israel’s claims that it was involved in southern Syria, the group released a statement on Friday stating that it was “surprised” Israeli media had involved it in what happened in Beit Jinn.\n\nDenouncing the attack, it said it conducts “no activities outside Lebanon”.\n\nThe group added that it has abided by and committed to the ceasefire agreement from November 2024 between Lebanon and Israel.\n\nYes.\n\nIn March 2024, Israel attacked al-Habbariyeh in southern Lebanon,  killing seven emergency relief volunteers .\n\nIt claimed the attack targeted a member of the group, calling him a “significant terrorist”.\n\nHowever, the alleged target was never named, the director of the Lebanese Emergency and Relief Corps’ Ambulance Association told Al Jazeera."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/30/polls-open-in-honduras-presidential-election-marked-by-fraud-accusations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"14:35:40+00:00","title":"Polls open in Honduras presidential election marked by fraud accusations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Honduras is holding a tightly contested presidential election amid widespread allegations of voter fraud, with three leading candidates—Rixi Moncada, Nasry Asfura, and Salvador Nasralla—accusing each other of political manipulation.

Israel-Palestine conflict\n\nPope Leo XIV has reiterated the Vatican’s insistence on a two-state resolution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying it’s the “only solution” that can guarantee  justice for both sides.\n\nLeo made the comments as he flew from Turkiye to Lebanon on Sunday for the second and final leg of his maiden international voyage as pope.\n\nOn the flight, the pontiff was asked by reporters about his private talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan upon his arrival in Ankara, and whether they discussed the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nLeo confirmed they had and said Turkiye has an “important role to play” to end both conflicts.\n\nOn Gaza, he repeated the Holy See’s longstanding position supporting a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. The creation of a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and Gaza has long been seen internationally as the only way to resolve the decades-long conflict.\n\n“We know that in this moment, Israel doesn’t accept this solution, but we see it as the only one that can offer a solution to the conflict that they are living in,” said Leo. “We are also friends with Israel, and we try with both sides to be a mediating voice that can help bring them closer to a solution with justice for all.”\n\nThe pope has avoided any direct mention of Israel’s  genocidal war on Gaza  while in Turkiye.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has long asserted that creating a Palestinian state would reward the Palestinian group Hamas and eventually lead to an even larger Hamas-run state on Israel’s borders.\n\nEarlier this month, Netanyahu said Israel’s opposition to a Palestinian state has “not changed one bit” and isn’t threatened by external or internal pressure. “I do not need affirmations, tweets or lectures from anyone,” he said.\n\nThe American pontiff landed in Beirut and is now set to meet Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun, the Arab world’s only Christian head of state, and deliver a speech to authorities and diplomats at the presidential palace later in the afternoon.\n\n“Many people are meeting him on the side of the road towards the presidential palace and he’s expected to meet Lebanese officials. He’ll also hold a huge mass in the centre of Beirut, and then visit several cities across the country,” reported Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem from the scene.\n\nAbout 30 percent of the population of Lebanon is Christian, while the vast majority are Muslim, roughly half of whom belong to the Shia and Sunni branches of Islam.\n\nTravelling abroad has become a major part of the modern papacy, with popes seeking to meet local Catholics, spread the faith, and conduct international diplomacy.\n\nLebanon’s diverse communities have also welcomed the papal trip with leading Druze cleric Sheikh Sami Abi al-Muna saying Lebanon “needs the glimmer of hope represented by this visit”.\n\nReinforcements from the Lebanese army and internal security forces were deployed to the airport before Leo’s arrival.\n\nHis convoy will pass through Beirut’s southern suburbs, an area where Hezbollah holds sway and where the terrain was battered in last year’s Israeli air strikes. Hezbollah’s Imam al-Mahdi Scouts are to hold a welcoming ceremony by the roadside as the convoy passes.\n\nLeo’s schedule includes a prayer at the site of a 2020 explosion at the Beirut port that killed 200 people and caused billions of dollars worth of damage.\n\nHe will also lead an outdoor mass on the Beirut waterfront and visit a psychiatric hospital, one of the few mental health facilities in Lebanon, where healthcare workers and residents are eagerly anticipating his arrival.\n\nLeo will not travel to the south, the target of Israeli attacks. Despite a United States-brokered ceasefire in November 2024, Israel continues to launch near-daily air strikes on southern Lebanon.\n\nThe pope “is coming to bless us and for the sake of peace”, said Farah Saadeh, a Beirut resident. “We have to wait and see what will happen after he leaves, and we hope nothing is going to happen after his departure,” Saadeh said.\n\nBefore Leo’s arrival, Hezbollah urged the pope to express his “rejection of injustice and aggression” that the country is being subjected to, a reference to the Israeli attacks."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe G4 geomagnetic storm, resulting from multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares from the Sun, is currently impacting Earth.

geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, located about 11 billion light years away in a distant galaxy.

2025-11-04T15:09:09+00:00\n\nTitle: Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/30/us-ukraine-negotiators-meet-as-trump-pushes-to-bring-war-to-an-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"17:53:29+00:00","title":"Rubio says US-Ukraine talks on ending war ‘productive’ but ‘complicated’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks in Florida to advance a peace plan aimed at creating reliable security guarantees for Ukraine, following revisions to Donald Trump’s original 28-point peace proposal.

Kyrgyzstan votes in snap parliamentary election with no opposition\n\nPolls are under way in Kyrgyzstan’s snap parliamentary election, in which allies of President Sadyr Japarov are expected to win a resounding victory.\n\nSunday’s vote takes place with no formal parties or organised opposition, and it is set to cement Japarov’s power.\n\nA populist and nationalist, Japarov has since 2020 established firm control of Kyrgyzstan, which was traditionally Central Asia’s most democratic country.\n\nVictory for his allies would set the stage for a presidential election due in 2027, when Japarov is expected to seek another term.\n\nAfter Kyrgyzstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the lively political life in the mountainous country of about 7 million was significant. In 2005, 2010 and 2020, Kyrgyz leaders were overthrown in street protests against elections that critics said were rigged, while Kyrgyz media was for decades the region’s freest.\n\nBut since coming to power on the back of the 2020 protests, Japarov has  clamped down on the media  and opposition groups.\n\nAn election had been due by November 2026, but parliament voted in September to dissolve itself for a snap election.\n\nEdil Baisalov, Kyrgyzstan’s deputy prime minister and an ally of Japarov, said the president’s popularity was partly based on rejecting the turbulence of previous decades, which he said had not improved living standards or offered stability.\n\n“The first 30 years we spent trying to copy,” he told the Reuters news agency. “We thought that we would adopt a Westminster-style parliamentary system and that we would live like Western countries. But it did not work, and it will not work.”\n\nBaisalov said the media crackdown, under which independent journalists have been designated “extremists”, was required to protect Kyrgyzstan from what he said were negative sentiments fanned by foreign social media platforms.\n\nBolot Ibragimov, an opposition candidate seeking election in the capital, Bishkek, said he expected about 80 percent of the parliament, which is dominated by allies of Japarov, to be re-elected.\n\nJaparov, who has backed banning online pornography and the return of the death penalty, is also bolstered by strong economic growth, the fastest in Central Asia, even as high inflation and electricity shortages erode living standards.\n\nEconomic experts say much of the boom is the result of Kyrgyzstan, which is in a customs union with Russia, becoming a key clearinghouse for imports to Russia redirected by sanctions over the war in Ukraine.\n\nWestern countries have imposed sanctions on several Kyrgyz banks and cryptocurrency companies, accusing them of facilitating Russian sanctions evasion.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, Japarov has embraced ties with Russia, which has military bases in Kyrgyzstan and where many Kyrgyz travel as migrant workers.\n\nLast week, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Bishkek for talks, and his face was displayed on billboards around the city."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/30/top-global-arms-producers-revenues-surged-as-major-wars-rage-sipri-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"23:59:56+00:00","title":"Top global arms producers’ revenues surge as major wars rage: SIPRI report","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2024, global arms revenues hit a record $679 billion, driven primarily by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as rising military expenditures worldwide.

producers’ revenues surge as major wars rage: SIPRI report\n\nRevenues from sales of weapons and military services by the 100 largest global arms-producing companies reached a record $679bn in 2024, according to new data released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe Gaza and Ukraine wars, as well as global and regional geopolitical tensions and ever-higher military expenditures, increased revenues generated by the companies from sales of military goods and services to customers domestic and abroad by 5.9 percent compared to the year before, the organisation said in a report published on Monday.\n\nThe bulk of the global rise was attributed to companies based in Europe and the United States, but there were year-on-year increases in all regions except for Asia and Oceania, where issues within the Chinese arms industry drove down the regional total.\n\nLockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics  led the pack in the US , where the combined arms revenues of arms companies in the top 100 grew by 3.8 percent in 2024 to reach $334bn, with 30 out of the 39 US companies in the ranking increasing their revenues.\n\nHowever, SIPRI said widespread delays and budget overruns continue to plague key projects such as the F-35 fighter jet, the Columbia and Virginia-class submarines, and the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX appeared in the list of top global military manufacturers for the first time, after its arms revenues more than doubled compared with 2023 to reach $1.8bn.\n\nExcluding Russia, there were 26 arms companies in the top 100 based in Europe, and 23 of them recorded increases in revenues from sales of weapons and equipment. Their aggregate arms revenues grew by 13 percent to $151bn.\n\nAfter boosting revenues by 193 percent to reach $3.6bn through making artillery shells for Ukraine, Czech company Czechoslovak Group recorded the sharpest percentage increase in arms revenues of any top 100 company in 2024.\n\nAs Ukraine faces a relentless Russian offensive in its eastern regions, the country’s JSC Ukrainian Defense Industry increased its arms revenues by 41 percent to $3bn.\n\nEuropean arms companies have been investing in new production capacity to fight off Russia, the SIPRI report said, but it cautioned that sourcing materials – particularly in the case of dependence on critical minerals – could pose a “growing challenge” as  China also tightens export controls .\n\nRostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation are the only two Russian arms companies in the ranking, and they also increased their combined arms revenues by 23 percent to $31.2bn despite being hit by Western-led sanctions over the Ukraine war.\n\nLast year, weapons makers in Asia and Oceania still registered $130bn in revenues after a 1.2 percent decline compared to 2023.\n\nThe regional drop was due to a combined 10 percent decline in arms revenues among the eight Chinese arms companies in the ranking, most prominently the 31 percent fall in the arms revenues of NORINCO, China’s primary producer of land systems.\n\n“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, Director of the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. “This deepens uncertainty around the status of China’s military modernisation efforts and when new capabilities will materialise.”\n\nBut Japanese and South Korean arms manufacturers’ sales surged on the back of strong demand from European as well as domestic customers amid  simmering tensions  over Taiwan and North Korea.\n\nFive Japanese companies in the ranking increased their combined arms revenues by 40 percent to $13.3bn, while four South Korean producers saw a 31 percent jump to $14.1bn in revenue. South Korea’s largest arms company, Hanwha Group, recorded a 42 percent surge in 2024, with more than half coming from arms exports.\n\nFor the first time, nine of the top 100 arms companies were based in the Middle East, according to SIPRI. The nine companies racked up a combined $31bn in revenue in 2024, showing a regional increase of 14 percent.\n\nAs the United Arab Emirates continues to face international allegations of  arming the devastating war in Sudan , the institute noted its regional figure excludes Emirati-based EDGE Group due to a lack of revenue data for 2023. The UAE rejects the accusations.\n\nThe three Israeli arms companies in the ranking increased their combined arms revenues by 16 percent to $16.2bn amid the  ongoing genocidal war on Gaza , which has killed nearly 70,000 Palestinians and destroyed most of the besieged enclave.\n\nElbit Systems pocketed $6.28bn in profits, followed by Israel Aerospace Industries with $5.19bn and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with $4.7bn.\n\nSIPRI said there was an international surge in interest in Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles and counter-drone systems. Rafael’s surge was tied to Iran, as demand for the company’s air defence systems rose to “unprecedented levels” after Iran’s  large-scale retaliatory strikes against Israel  in April and October 2024 that used ballistic missiles and drones.\n\nFive Turkish companies were in the top 100 – also a record.  Their combined arms revenues amounted to $10.1bn, showing an 11 percent increase.\n\nBaykar, which makes, among other things, advanced drones most recently sold to Ukraine, saw 95 percent of its $1.9bn in arms revenue in 2024 come from exports to other countries.\n\nMilitary companies from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, India, Taiwan, Norway, Canada, Spain, Poland and Indonesia were in the ranking as well."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar comet ever detected, which entered our solar system in 2025 and passed near Mars and Earth.

They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has expanded its social media ban for children under 16 to include platforms such as Reddit and Kick, alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, with the ban set to take effect on December 10, 2025.

addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak with over 5,000 cases and two deaths, leading to the Americas region losing its collective elimination designation.

lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9z2e3exk9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"23:24:20.919+00:00","title":"Ukraine talks 'productive' but more work needed, Rubio says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov held productive talks in Hallandale Beach, Florida, aiming to establish a lasting peace in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

assisted suicide, the group says.\n\nLudwig Minelli, 92, died on Saturday, days before his 93rd birthday.\n\nThe group paid tribute to Minelli, saying he had led a \"life for freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights\".\n\nMinelli founded Dignitas in 1998, and since then it has helped thousands of people to die.\n\nIn recent decades, some countries have shifted their stance on assisted dying, with Australia, Canada and New Zealand introducing laws. The UK House of Lords is currently debating the  assisted dying bill .\n\nCritics of the legalisation say it could see disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives.\n\nMinelli began his career as a journalist, working as a correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, before studying law and taking an interest in human rights.\n\nAcross his life, he campaigned passionately for the right to die, giving Dignitas the slogan \"dignity in life, dignity in death\".\n\nIn  a 2010 interview with the BBC , he said: \"I am persuaded that we have to struggle in order to implement the last human right in our societies. And the last human right is the right to make a decision on one's own end, and the possibility to have this end without risk and without pain.\"\n\nMinelli founded Dignitas after splitting from the older Swiss assisted dying organisation, Exit, because he felt its rules were too restrictive.\n\nThe group became world famous because it offers assisted suicide to non-Swiss citizens who travel to Switzerland because assisted dying is not permitted in their own countries.\n\nWithin Switzerland he was sometimes criticised for an alleged lack of transparency over the financial dealings of the organisation, and for offering assisted dying to those who were not terminally ill, but who wanted to end their lives.\n\nHe faced numerous legal challenges, and made multiple successful appeals to the Swiss supreme court\n\nIn a statement, Dignitas said his work had had a lasting influence, pointing to a 2011 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, in which it confirmed the right of a person capable of judgement to decide on the manner and the time of their own end of life.\n\nEuthanasia - when a lethal drug is administered by a physician to deliberately end a person's life to relieve suffering - is illegal in Switzerland.\n\nBut assisted dying has been permitted under Swiss law since 1942, under strict conditions including a stipulation that there is no profit motive involved, and that the individual wishing to die is of sound mind.\n\nDignitas said in a statement that it would continue to \"manage and develop the association in the spirit of its founder as a professional and combative international organisation for self-determination and freedom of choice in life and at the end of life\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qp3q5q708o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"00:04:40.459+00:00","title":"They have six packs - but they're still jumping on and off weight-loss jabs","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the growing trend of healthy individuals—such as Gabriela and Andrew—using weight-loss injections like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro for cosmetic purposes, despite lacking medical conditions or BMI thresholds for prescription.

was trying to lose the weight she'd gained during the Covid pandemic. But a few stubborn kilos just wouldn't budge.\n\nShe had tried everything, she says. Going on a stricter diet; being more consistent with her high-intensity workouts six days a week.\n\nBut \"nothing worked\" for the Brazilian lawyer who weighed 76kg (11st 13lb) and is 1.69m tall (5ft 6in).\n\nThen, friends let her in on a secret - they'd been using weight-loss injections and were thrilled with the results.\n\nSo despite being a long-standing fitness fanatic, Gabriela, 40, decided to do the same.\n\nShe bought her first Ozempic jabs in February 2024 from a pharmacy in Rio de Janeiro – with no prescription - and began taking them without medical oversight.\n\nThe results were almost immediate.\n\n\"It was surreal,\" recalls Gabriela, which is not her real name. \"I'd go to a Japanese buffet, eat six pieces of sushi and feel like I'd had a whole rack of ribs.\"\n\nThe transformation was noticeable, but it didn't last. When she stopped taking the injections, slowly but surely, the weight crept back.\n\nThat's when Gabriela's new routine began. She would stop taking the jabs when she was satisfied with the way she looked. But when the reflection in the mirror wasn't quite what she wanted, the process would begin again.\n\nShe's been going through this cycle for a year now.\n\n\"When I look in the mirror and like what I see, everything in life feels easier,\" she says.\n\nDoctors warn that people like Gabriela, who have no medical need for weight-loss jabs and are taking them intermittently and without clinical supervision, are gambling with their health.\n\nIn the UK, the National Health Service generally won't prescribe weight-loss jabs - which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger and make you feel full for longer - unless your body mass index (BMI) is above 35 or 40, depending on the drug. The threshold is lower for some ethnic groups and people with certain weight-related health conditions.\n\nGabriela's BMI was 26.6 when she started taking the jabs. She had no weight-related conditions and was a muscular woman who regularly did high-intensity exercise.\n\n\"There is a growing trend of its use for cosmetic purposes,\" says Dr Bharti Shetye, vice-president of the Obesity Medicine Association in the US.\n\n\"I hear of so many cases of people using it just to look good.\"\n\nProfessor and endocrinologist Simone van de Sande Lee is clear: \"These are drugs approved to treat conditions like diabetes or obesity - they are not cosmetic tools.\"\n\nAndrew, 49, was also far below the threshold for being prescribed weight-loss drugs in the UK.\n\nA top executive of a food company used to hosting lavish parties in his central London penthouse, it was feeling unhappy about his appearance that compelled him to act.\n\n\"I felt like I was a bit puffy… I didn't feel good about myself,\" the 49-year-old, who also asked for his real name not to be used, says.\n\n\"I came back from Christmas holidays and thought, 'I'm going to fix this somehow.'\"\n\nAt the time, Andrew weighed around 90kg (14st 2lb) at 1.83m (6ft) tall, though like Gabriela he was also muscular. This gave him a BMI of 26.9.\n\nDespite this, Andrew says he was able to obtain the jabs from an online pharmacy, simply by completing a self-assessment. As far as he is aware, no-one checked if what he'd written was accurate or whether the treatment was appropriate.\n\nIn early 2024, he began weekly injections of Wegovy and later Mounjaro.\n\n\"Almost immediately what I felt with the jab is that the food noise went away from me… I really enjoyed not having to think about food so much.\"\n\nNow, Andrew still goes out to restaurants but eats much less.\n\n\"I never feel, or very rarely feel, that urgent hunger that I used to.\"\n\nLike Gabriela, he cycles on and off the jabs depending on social events. He used them before a boat trip to the Mediterranean this summer, then stopped for a couple of months, only to resume again recently, before Christmas, he explains.\n\nGabriela sometimes skips doses before parties so she can eat more.\n\n\"If I know I'm going to drink a lot one day, I don't take it,\" she says. \"I'm like, 'Come on, I'm already going to be drinking a ton of beer - why would I take it?' So I don't.\"\n\n\"These days, I'm probably taking it in a pretty sloppy way - honestly, I have no idea,\" she adds.\n\nShe explains cycling on and off the medication helps her make it last longer and save money. So far, Gabriela estimates having spent more than $2,000 (£1,500).\n\nWhile both Gabriela and Andrew are positive about their experiences, health experts point to risks with taking weight-loss jabs irregularly and without oversight.\n\nWhile earlier versions of GLP-1 drugs were used as early as the 1990s for type 2 diabetes, it's only in the past four years that the drugs have truly surged in popularity, after medical regulators around the world began licensing them for weight loss.\n\n\"We simply don't know the effects in people using these drugs purely for cosmetic purposes,\" says Simon Cork, senior lecturer in physiology at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK.\n\nProf Lee adds that most of what we know about these drugs comes from people who use them consistently under medical supervision, so any stop-and-start pattern makes it harder to gauge their long-term effects.\n\nDr Bruno Halpern, endocrinologist and president-elect of the World Obesity Federation, said research suggested the drugs for people with obesity or diabetes were \"relatively safe\".\n\n\"But if millions of healthy people start using them - some without medical need - we may begin to see rare side effects more regularly,\" he adds.\n\nCommon side effects of the drugs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation.\n\nBut rarer and more serious ones include acute gallstone disease, pancreatitis and serious allergic reactions.\n\nGabriela says her only issue so far has been mild stomach pain, which she blames on a combination of not eating and drinking alcohol while using the jabs.\n\n\"I was going through a wild phase,\" she admits.\n\nAnother drawback of the jabs is that they can cause people to lose muscle as well as fat, and this is likely to be particularly true for those who are slimmer, says Halpern.\n\n\"Slim individuals on restrictive diets tend to lose muscle more than fat,\" he says.\n\n\"If they regain weight later, their body composition worsens,\" he adds, noting that this \"yo-yo cycle\" of losing and regaining \"raises the long-term risk of weight gain,\" especially when cycling on and off the medication.\n\nThe patient leaflets for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro recommend once‑weekly injections on a fixed schedule under medical supervision, indicating the drugs are intended for regular, continuous use rather than occasional or sporadic dosing.\n\nThey are meant to be injected into the upper arm, thigh, or stomach, with doses gradually increased.\n\nThere are also psychological dangers.\n\nDr Halpern says he sees patients who imagine that if they lose weight they'll feel loved, happy and accepted, but these expectations are rarely realistic.\n\nWhen people stop taking jabs and the weight returns, they often feel like failures, he says.\n\nAnother challenge is that our bodies tend to resist long-term weight loss, explains Dr Cork.\n\n\"When you lose weight, your body doesn't just say, 'Great, job done.' Hunger hormones ramp up, your metabolism slows, and your body tries to restore what it sees as your natural point.\"\n\nHe points out that as soon as patients stop taking the jabs, which suppress hunger signals, the body resumes its fight to regain the weight it has lost.\n\nThis is why they are intended for long-term use in patients who need them, he says, stressing that obesity is a chronic disease. In the UK, NHS guidelines currently limit the use of weight-loss drugs to a maximum of two years.\n\nIn early 2025, Britain's General Pharmaceutical Council tightened restrictions on how online pharmacies can sell and prescribe the jabs in response to growing concerns about misuse, safety and supply shortages.\n\nBrazil also tightened the rules this year around the prescribing of the drugs for similar reasons.\n\nDespite the risks, Gabriela and Andrew say they have no plans to stop.\n\n\"I think I've become addicted to it,\" admits Gabriela, while Andrew sees the drug as a long-term commitment to his appearance.\n\nHe sees it as a \"relatively informed risk\" he's taking.\n\n\"If I happen to cycle on and off this for the rest of my life, that would probably be OK.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dy9qp71v2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-12-01","timeOfPublication":"01:13:59.605+00:00","title":"Aditya-L1: Why 2026 will be a year like no other for India’s Sun mission","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India's Aditya-L1 solar mission, launched in 2024, is poised to play a pivotal role in monitoring the Sun during its peak solar activity cycle in 2026.

mission in space, the year 2026 is expected to be like no other.\n\nIt's the first time the observatory – which was placed in orbit last year - will be able to watch the Sun when it reaches its maximum activity cycle.\n\nAccording to Nasa, it comes roughly every 11 years when the Sun's magnetic poles flip - the Earth equivalent would be the North and South poles swapping positions.\n\nIt's a time of great turbulence. It sees the Sun transition from calm to stormy and is marked by a huge increase in the number of solar storms and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - massive bubbles of fire that blow out of the Sun's outermost layer called corona.\n\nMade up of charged particles, a CME can weigh up to a trillion kilograms and can attain a speed of up to 3,000km (1,864 miles) per second. It can head out in any direction, including towards the Earth. At top speed, it would take a CME 15 hours to cover the 150 million km Earth-Sun distance.\n\n\"In the normal or low-activity times, the Sun launches two to three CMEs a day,\" says Prof R Ramesh of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). \"Next year, we expect them to be 10 or more daily.\"\n\nProf Ramesh is the principal investigator on Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, or Velc - the most important of the seven scientific instruments on Aditya-L1 - and closely monitors and decodes the data it gathers.\n\nStudying CMEs is one of the most important scientific objectives of India's maiden solar mission, he says. One, because the ejections provide an opportunity to learn about the star at the centre of our solar system, and two, because activities that take place on the Sun threaten infrastructure on Earth and in space.\n\nCMEs rarely pose a direct threat to human life, but they do affect life on Earth by causing geomagnetic storms that impact the weather in near space, where nearly 11,000 satellites,  including 136 from India , are stationed.\n\n\"The most beautiful manifestations of a CME are auroras, which are a clear example that charged particles from Sun are travelling to Earth,\" Prof Ramesh explains.\n\n\"But they can also make all the electronics on a satellite malfunction, knock down power grids and affect weather and communication satellites.\"\n\nThe most powerful solar storm ever recorded was the  Carrington Event  in 1859, which knocked out telegraph lines across the globe. More recent events were recorded in 1989, when a part of Quebec's power grid was  knocked out , leaving six million people without power for nine hours. In November 2015,  solar activity disrupted  air traffic control, leading to chaos in Sweden and some other European airports.\n\nIn February 2022,  Nasa reported  that a CME had led to 38 commercial satellites being lost.\n\nProf Ramesh says that if we are able to see what happens on the Sun's corona and spot a solar storm or a coronal mass ejection in real time, record its temperature at origin and watch its trajectory, it can work as a forewarning to switch off power grids and satellites and move them out of harm's way.\n\nThere are other solar missions watching the Sun, but Aditya-L1 has an advantage over others, including the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory sent jointly by Nasa and Esa (European Space Agency), when it comes to watching the corona.\n\n\"Aditya-L1's coronagraph is the exact size that lets it nearly mimic the Moon, fully covering the Sun's photosphere and allowing it an uninterrupted view of almost all of the corona 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, even during eclipses and occultations,\" says Prof Ramesh.\n\nIn other words, the coronagraph acts like an artificial Moon, blocking the Sun's bright surface to let scientists continuously observe its faint outer corona  -something the real Moon does only during eclipses.\n\nMoreover, this is the only mission that can study eruptions in visible light, letting it measure a CME's temperature and heat energy - key clues that show how strong a CME would be if it headed toward Earth, says Prof Ramesh.\n\nTo prepare for next year's peak solar activity period, the IIA collaborated with Nasa to study the data it gathered from one of the largest CMEs that Aditya-L1 has recorded until now.\n\nIt originated on 13 September 2024 at 00:30 GMT, Prof Ramesh says. Its mass was 270 million tonnes - the iceberg that sank Titanic was 1.5 million tonnes, he says.\n\nAt origin, its temperature was 1.8 million degrees Celsius and the energy content was equivalent to 2.2 million megatons of TNT – in comparison, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 15 kilotons and 21 kilotons respectively.\n\nEven though the numbers make it sound incredibly large, Prof Ramesh describes it as a \"medium-sized\" one.\n\nThe asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth was 100 million megatons and during the Sun's maximum activity cycle, he says, we could see CMEs with energy content equal to even more than that.\n\n\"I consider the CME we evaluated to have occurred when the Sun was in the normal activity phase. Now this sets the benchmark that we'll be using to evaluate what is in store when the maximum activity cycle occurs,\" he says.\n\n\"The learnings from this will help us work out the countermeasures to be adopted to protect satellites in near space. They will also help us gain a better understanding of near-Earth space,\" he adds.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube ,  Twitter  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2465lndrnno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"01:29:16.759+00:00","title":"Will new warning labels in Ireland turn people away from alcohol?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ireland has introduced some of the world’s strongest alcohol warning labels since 2023, stating that drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers.

2025-11-30T01:29:16.759+00:00\n\nTitle: Will new warning labels in Ireland turn people away from alcohol?\n\nJack likes a drink and a standard night out will probably involve several pints at his local.\n\n\"If you have three pints, that is easy, easy going,\" the 29-year-old says. \"Probably a heavy night, casually, would be like six-plus pints.\"\n\nJack grew up in County Galway where, he says, young people often start drinking at 14 or 15, \"usually in a field with a horrendous can of cider\".\n\n\"And then, when you're 17, your dad brings you to a pub, buys you your pint of Guinness, and that's where it takes hold.\"\n\nIreland has a complex relationship with drinking and many see alcohol and socialising as inextricably linked, part of the social fabric of everyday life.\n\nPubs tend to be the focal point of communities where there's often live music, and many traditional songs celebrate or speak of the harms of having one too many. Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.\n\nSince 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.\n\nFirst signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.\n\nBut in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.\n\nFor its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.\n\nIt was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.\n\n\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"\n\nA big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.\n\nYet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.\n\n\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"\n\nThree-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.\n\nConsumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).\n\nYoung people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.\n\nA report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.\n\nCampaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact. But 23-year-old Amanda, who's seen the labels, isn't so sure.\n\n\"You look at it and you're like, 'Oh, I just drank that. Should I drink another one?'\"\n\nAmanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.\n\n\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.\n\nOn a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.\n\n\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"\n\nShe's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.\n\n\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.\n\nUnlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.\n\n\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down. At times you'd just be like, 'I'm really not in the humour to have a pint, but I want to sit somewhere and see my friends' - so you have to get a pint.\"\n\nHe's seen the alcohol warning labels too, but isn't sure they will put him off drinking.\n\n\"Everyone kinda knows it's bad for you, but we do it anyway,\" he says.\n\nCigarette warning labels are \"far more graphic\", Sean's friend Mark adds.\n\nIreland was the front-runner in restricting smoking and since 2004 you can't smoke in the workplace or restaurants and bars.\n\nEven before the introduction of the new warning labels, some young Irish people in their 20s have been finding they are better off without alcohol in their lives.\n\nMark rarely drinks. It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.\n\n\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"\n\nHelen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.\n\n\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"\n\nHelen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.\n\n\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"\n\nIn 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session.

How people are embracing winter arc without burning out\n\nHave you ever locked in?\n\nNo, not finding yourself locked in a lift or a bathroom.\n\nWe're talking about locking IN - the phrase you might have seen on social media or heard people saying lately.\n\nTo lock in is to focus; to endure short-term pain for long-term gain - whether that be building your body or your business. Do it today - not tomorrow. Everything else is a distraction.\n\nMotivational and ironic videos feature the phrase, which has been searched for online more this year than ever before, according to Google. So how exactly are people locking in and is it helping or hindering them?\n\n\"My generation thrives off romanticising things,\" says Dani, a 20-year-old student at the University of Manchester.\n\n\"I feel like locking in is a way of romanticising getting into your deep work and making that decision of like, 'okay, it's time to get stuff done'.\" She compares it to tunnel vision.\n\nIn her case it was a marathon revision session until 3am recently ahead of 10 hours in exam labs the following day. Her phone was kept on silent; electro-beats hummed in the background; digestive biscuits were devoured.\n\nIn recent weeks as the nights have drawn in and days become colder, some influencers have been telling followers to stop missing the summer and see this as the perfect opportunity to lock in - to embrace their winter arc.\n\n\"I think it comes from TV shows and anime where you have characters with a villain arc,\" says Dani. She thinks feeling as though you are on a transformative journey of your own helps you stay on track with the tasks necessary to achieve your goals.\n\nKaragii agrees. She has turned her passion for gaming into a living and now works as a professional content creator in that industry - she locked in.\n\nFor her, the phrase also serves as a personal rallying cry because of the sexism she faces \"almost every other day\" when playing games online.\n\nHer streams can last 11 hours so she has to ensure she eats regularly and spends time away from the keyboard - usually watching anime, playing with her cat or reading.\n\nThe 29-year-old says the comments she receives range from the patronising, \"you're good for a girl\", to the insulting - \"get back in the kitchen\".\n\n\"I tell myself 'I need to lock in' so [I remember] I can also play well, just like everyone else,\" she tells me from her home in Surrey.\n\n\"And also, remind myself that I need to be a role model to the young women that watch me.\"\n\nThat struggle for acceptance is also something Emma felt about joining a gym - but she found a way to overcome it.\n\nShe initially did workouts at home and reduced the calories in her diet, as she felt she needed to fit a certain image of a gym goer.\n\nNow Emma, 28, feels this was damaging and unnecessary.\n\nAfter a year of training at home, she eventually joined a gym and enjoyed the physical and mental boost of lifting weights.\n\nSo much so, she began working as a personal trainer in Lancashire this year and thinks one of the best ways to lock in is setting realistic and achievable goals.\n\nHaving a methodical plan and a clear structure can help you get started but she cautions that you can burn out by locking in too much.\n\n\"That's completely normal and I think people should be reassured that is kind of part of the process and you're not always going to feel motivated 365 days a year,\" she tells me.\n\nEmma says there are ways to help avoid burning out. These include freshening up your workout routine, trying a new fitness class, or taking part in a challenge for a short length of time - like cycling a certain number of miles in a month.\n\n\"Accountability goes a long way as well when your motivation is low,\" she adds. Partnering up with a friend for your workout can help spur you into doing them more regularly.\n\nAdam Aleksic, a linguist who posts online as Etymology Nerd, says locking in's origins aren't certain but its use appears to have begun in the early 2000s - particularly in the African American community. There's an Urban Dictionary reference dating back to 2009.\n\nBut it's only in the last year that it has taken off online, whether it be a motivational video for gains in the gym or ironically in a meme about a lazy cat.\n\n\"The more a meme gets readapted and reused, the more chances it has to stick in our actual vocabulary,\" the 24-year-old explains.\n\nDespite that, locking in didn't make it onto the word of the year lists for 2025. Collins' word of the year was  \"vibe coding\" , while  \"parasocial\"  was Cambridge Dictionary's.\n\nAs well as using it to motivate themselves, Dani and her course mates often use the locking in phrase light-heartedly.\n\nSome days they all work on the same project in the same computer lab at uni. Telling a friend to lock in on what might well be a boring day often raises a smile.\n\n\"It has that element of connecting us all,\" says Dani. \"I've never actually realised, given how much we use it, that it's slang.\"\n\nAfter her 10-hour day in labs a fortnight ago, Dani indulged her love of art - something she does to stop burning out.\n\n\"My friend and I were painting until 4am after our exam,\" she tells me. They were locked in."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgex9d0212xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-12-01","timeOfPublication":"00:10:14.827+00:00","title":"Greek sheep and goat cull raises fears of feta cheese shortage","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A viral outbreak of sheep and goat pox in Greece, first detected in August 2024, has led to the culling of over 417,000 sheep and goats — roughly 4-5% of the country’s livestock — across multiple regions, especially in Thessaly.

of feta cheese shortage\n\nHundreds of thousands of sheep and goats are being culled in Greece, due to the outbreak of an infectious disease. It may affect production and exports of the country's famous feta cheese.\n\nAnastasia Siourtou walks through her deserted farm on the outskirts of Karditsa, a city in the Thessaly region of central Greece.\n\nAn eerie silence hangs over the place where 650 sheep were being raised.\n\nOn 12 November veterinary officials culled all the livestock after a case of sheep and goat pox was detected.\n\n\"There is another farm two kilometres away. They had pox cases, but hid it,\" she says, alluding to how she believes her herd contracted the disease.\n\nMs Siourtou is a veterinarian herself and has expanded the farm that her father built.\n\nLosing the animals means financial ruin - besides the livestock the farm lost, the sheep's milk, which is sold for the production of feta cheese, is often referred to as Greece's \"white gold\".\n\nMore than the financial blow, however, Ms Siourtou speaks of the emotional toll. \"I was here the day the sheep were culled. It is very cruel, I felt that I failed to protect them.\"\n\nSheep and goat pox is a viral infection. The first cases were detected in northern Greece in August 2024, and the disease has since spread across many regions of the country.\n\nA total of 1,702 incidents had been recorded by mid-November, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.\n\nDetecting a single case on a farm means the entire herd must be culled for preventive reasons. Some 417,000 sheep and goats have been disposed of so far, which is roughly 4-5% of the previous total.\n\nApproximately 80% of Greek sheep and goat's milk  goes towards making feta cheese,  which is a  protected designation of origin  within the European Union.\n\nThis means that while similar cheese can be produced elsewhere in the EU it cannot be called feta. The UK continues to respect this 2002 ruling following Brexit.\n\nLast year, Greece exported €785m ($909m; £690m) of feta, figures from the Greek Exports Association show. Of this, €520m went to fellow EU nations, and €90m to the UK.\n\nFeta has to be made of at least 70% sheep's milk, with the remainder being goat's.\n\nSmall dairies say they are already having problems sourcing sheep's milk, which could mean possible shortages of feta going forward. While prices have not yet increased in turn, this will likely be the result if the outbreak is not eradicated.\n\n\"The limited amount of available milk increases production costs and makes it more difficult to maintain current quantities [of feta] on the market,\" says Prof Dimitris Gougoulis from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Thessaly.\n\nAnother sheep farmer near Karditsa, Tassos Manakas, saw his 873-strong herd culled on 9 October.\n\nHe now spends his days sitting in a small room in his barn. \"The shop is closed,\" he says bitterly.\n\nMr Manakas walks past the empty metal feeders and the milking room now gathering cobwebs. \"I used to come in in the morning, hear the animals bleating, stroke them.\n\n\"The day they were culled, I was here. If you cut me that day, I wouldn't bleed.\"\n\nHe is flipping thoughtfully through a government document packed with numerical tables.\n\nAffected farmers are being offered compensation of between €132 and €220 per sheep depending on its age. Farmers respond that the payments fall far short of covering their losses.\n\nThe government has also been criticised for its wider response to the outbreak. A National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox was only established only in late October - a full 14 months after the first case was detected.\n\nMeanwhile, no lockdown zones were established in the areas where the first cases were recorded in late summer of 2024, and critics say that the state veterinary service is significantly understaffed.\n\nAt the same time, farmers have been arrested for the illegal transport of animals in trucks into areas considered disease-free. And local reports say infected animals have been buried in fields without notifying the authorities.\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food tells the BBC: \"We implemented the plan to eradicate sheep pox from the very beginning, as provided for in the European protocols.\n\n\"The result was to reach almost zero cases in the spring of 2025. The decision to establish the scientific committee in October 2025 was taken under the pressure of one factor - many farmers did not comply with biosecurity measures, resulting in an explosion in cases.\"\n\nGreece's Supreme Court has now ruled that prosecutors must investigate possible violations of biosecurity measures, which many critics say is overdue.\n\nAcross the country, there are still farms operating under 1960s standards – tin shacks, walls made of baked soil or cement bricks, and no fencing.\n\nThe BBC visited one such farm on the outskirts of the city of Larissa, in Thessaly. Two dead lambs were lying on the ground.\n\nThe owner insisted that there were no cases of pox on his farm. He refused to allow photographs. \"Some animals have lumps on their chest. It's not pox, but no one will believe me,\" he says.\n\nSheep and goat farmers in Thessaly are calling for approval of mass vaccination of their herds, which they say is how the problem is tackled in Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\nSuch vaccination is allowed in an emergency  under EU rules,  and farmers are putting a lot of pressure on the government to request vaccines from the Commission's available stock.\n\nHowever, the Greek government responds that mass vaccination could lead to Greece being classified as an endemic country for the diseases, which would bring restrictions on the export of sheep and goat's milk - and especially of feta cheese. Greek authorities also stress that there is currently no certified vaccine against sheep pox.\n\nProf Gougoulis points out that the existing older vaccines are effective in countries where pox is endemic, but \"are not a tool for eradication [of the disease]\". \"They do not completely prevent infection, and the virus can continue to circulate within vaccinated populations.\"\n\nYet the situation now seems to be getting out of control.\n\nMembers of the National Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox recently told journalists that livestock farmers in different parts of the country may have carried out as many as one million illegal vaccinations. This distorts the epidemiological picture and makes disease control even more difficult.\n\nBut many livestock farmers are angry with the officials' assumption. They say it is an arbitrary calculation and accuse the scientific committee of endangering the export of feta.\n\nFarmer Haris Seskliotis, in the village of Rizomylos near Volos, listens to all this with deep concern. One infection was detected on his farm, leading to the preventive culling of 700 sheep.\n\nIt was the second time his farm was ruined, following the devastating floods in Thessaly in 2023.\n\n\"It's extremely harsh,\" he tells the BBC, walking through his sheep empty pens.\n\nThere are stacks of hay bales around meant for sheep to eat, now left unused in the yard of the farm and soon to rot.\n\nMr Seskliotis is not the kind of farmer who sits and counts his wounds. \"I am thinking of setting up a new unit with my son for fattening calves,\" he says. \"We have not learned anything other than raising herds.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv76r5qpvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"11:49:50.522+00:00","title":"Benjamin Netanyahu seeks pardon from Israel's president","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formally requested a pardon from President Isaac Herzog over corruption charges related to bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, citing national unity and public interest.

president\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the country's President, Isaac Herzog, for a pardon over corruption cases he has been battling.\n\nThe president's office said Herzog would receive opinions from justice officials before considering the request \"which carries with it significant implications\".\n\nNetanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He denies wrongdoing.\n\nHe said in a video message that he would have preferred to see the process to the end but national interest \"demanded otherwise\".\n\nThe Israeli opposition says he should admit guilt before seeking a pardon.\n\nEarly this month, US President Donald Trump urged Herzog to \"fully pardon\" Netanyahu.\n\nAt the time, Herzog made it clear that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.\n\nOn Sunday, his office released the request and a letter by Netanyahu himself, in light of \"the importance of this extraordinary request and its implications\".\n\nIt offered no indication of when the president might reach a decision.\n\nIn 2020, Benjamin Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial:\n\nNetanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch hunt\" by political opponents.\n\nIn Sunday's defiant video message, he claimed that the cases against him were collapsing, but that the process was tearing Israel apart from within.\n\n\"I am certain, as are many others in the nation, that an immediate end to the trial would greatly help lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation - something our country desperately needs,\" the prime minister added.\n\nNetanyahu said he was being required to testify before court three times a week, describing that as \"an impossible demand.\"\n\nA pardon, he insisted, would help Israel fend off threats and seize opportunities by fostering \"national unity\".\n\nHis political opponents have accused Netanyahu of attempting to conflate his interests with those of the state.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid said there could be no pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and Netanyahu's immediate retirement from political life.\n\nYair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of Israeli forces, said \"only the guilty\" sought pardon.\n\nAccording to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute [alter] their sentence\".\n\nHowever, Israel's High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president can pardon an individual before they are convicted if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters have always supported a  pardon for their leader.\n\nBut for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.\n\nPublic concerns over the government's plans for judicial reform brought hundreds of thousands out on to the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 which triggered the most recent Gaza war.\n\nIn a separate case,  the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant last year for Netanyahu  and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes and crimes against humanity that have allegedly been committed during the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu has condemned the move as \"antisemitic\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvdn8pmmd1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"22:02:43.207+00:00","title":"Sudan civil war: The terrifying escape from el-Fasher in Darfur","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The fall of el-Fasher in October 2023, after an 18-month siege, marked a devastating turning point in Sudan's civil war.

serious nerve damage to his leg during the long siege of the Sudanese city of el-Fasher because he could not get medicine for his diabetes.\n\nThe 62-year-old walks with a heavy limp, but he was so panicked when fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) finally captured the city in the western Darfur region, he felt no pain as he ran.\n\n\"The morning the RSF came there were bullets, many bullets, and explosives going off,\" he says.\n\n\"People were out of control [with fear], they ran out of their houses, and everyone ran in different directions, the father, the son, the daughter - running.\"\n\nThe fall of el-Fasher after an 18-month siege is a particularly brutal chapter in Sudan's civil war.\n\nThe BBC has travelled to a tent camp in northern Sudan set up in army-controlled territory to hear first-hand the stories of those who escaped. The team was monitored by the authorities throughout the visit.\n\nThe RSF has been fighting the regular army since April 2023 when a power struggle between them erupted into war.\n\nTaking over el-Fasher was a major victory for the paramilitary group, pushing the army out of its last foothold in Darfur.\n\nBut evidence of mass atrocities has drawn international condemnation and focused greater American attention on trying to end the conflict.\n\nWarning: This report contains details that some readers may find distressing.\n\nWe found Mr Ali wandering around the camp, located in the desert about 770km (480 miles) north-east of el-Fasher, near the town of al-Dabbah.\n\nHe was trying to register his family for a tent.\n\n\"They [RSF fighters] were shooting at the people - the elderly, the civilians, with live ammunition, they would empty their guns on them,\" he told us.\n\n\"Some of the RSF came with their cars. If they saw someone was still breathing, they drove over them.\"\n\nMr Ali said he ran when he could, crawling along the ground or hiding when the threat got too close. He managed to get to the village of Gurni, a few kilometres from el-Fasher.\n\nGurni was the first stop for many who fled the city, including Mohammed Abbaker Adam, a local official in the nearby Zamzam camp for displaced people.\n\nMr Adam retreated to el-Fasher when Zamzam was overrun by the RSF in April, and left the day before they captured the city in October.\n\nHe grew a white beard to make himself look older, hoping that it would lead to more lenient treatment.\n\n\"The road here was full of death,\" he said.\n\n\"They shot some people directly in front of us and then carried them and threw them far away. And on the road, we saw dead bodies out in the open, unburied. Some had lain there for two or three days.\"\n\n\"So many people are scattered around,\" he added. \"We don't know where they are.\"\n\nSome of those who did not take the long trek to al-Dabbah made it to a humanitarian hub in Tawila, some 70km from el-Fasher.\n\nOthers crossed into Chad. But the UN says less than half of the 260,000 people estimated to have been in the city before it fell have not been accounted for.\n\nAid agencies believe many people did not get very far - unable to escape because of danger, or detention, or the cost of buying their way out.\n\nMr Adam said the fighters also raped women, corroborating widespread accounts of sexual violence.\n\n\"They would take a woman behind a tree, or take her far from us, out of sight, so you wouldn't see with your own eyes,\" he said.\n\n\"But you would hear her shout: 'Help me, help me.' And she would come and say, 'They raped me.'\"\n\nThere are mostly women in the camp, and many do not want to be identified to protect those left behind.\n\nOne 19-year-old woman told us that RSF fighters at a checkpoint took a girl from the group she was travelling with, and they had to leave her behind.\n\n\"I was scared,\" she said. \"When they took her out of the car at the checkpoint, I was afraid that at every checkpoint they would take a girl. But they just took her, and that was it until we got here.\"\n\nShe had travelled here with her younger sister and brother. Her father, a soldier, had been killed in battle. Her mother was not in el-Fasher when it fell.\n\nSo the three siblings escaped the city on foot with their grandmother, but she died before they reached Gurni, leaving them to carry on alone.\n\n\"We hadn't taken enough water because we didn't know the distance was so far,\" said the young woman.\n\n\"We walked and walked and my grandmother passed out. I thought it might be lack of food or water.\n\n\"I checked her pulse, but she didn't wake up, so I found a doctor in a nearby village. He came and said, 'Your grandmother has given you her soul.' I was trying to keep myself together because of my sister and brother, but I didn't know how I would tell my mother.\"\n\nThey were all particularly worried about their 15-year-old brother because the RSF suspected that fleeing men had fought with the army.\n\nThe boy described his ordeal at one checkpoint when all the young men were taken out of the vehicles.\n\n\"The RSF interrogated us for hours in the sun,\" he explained. \"They said we were soldiers - some of the older ones probably were.\n\n\"The RSF fighters stood over us and circled around us, whipping us and threatening us with their guns. I lost hope and told them, 'Whatever you want to do to me, do it.'\"\n\nIn the end they let him go - after his 13-year-old sister told them her father was dead, and he was her only brother. They were reunited with their mother in the camp at al-Dabbah.\n\nMany people describe the RSF separating the old men and women from the fighting-age men.\n\nThat happened to Abdullah Adam Mohamed in Gurni, tearing him away from his three little girls - aged two, four and six. The perfume seller had been looking after them since his wife was killed in shelling four months ago.\n\n\"I gave my daughters to the women [travelling with us],\" he told the BBC. \"Then the RSF brought big vehicles, and we [the men] were scared they were going to forcibly recruit us. So some of us ran and escaped into the neighbourhood.\n\n\"All night, I was thinking, how am I going to find my children again? I've lost so many people already - I was afraid I'd lose them too.\"\n\nMr Mohamed escaped, but others did not. Mr Ali said he saw from a distance the RSF open fire on a group of men.\n\n\"They killed the men, they didn't kill the women, but the men were all shot,\" he told the BBC. \"There were a lot dead and we ran away.\"\n\nMr Ali and Mr Adam left Gurni on donkeys, travelling by night to the next village, Tur'rah.\n\nMr Mohamed also made it to Tur'rah, where he was reunited with his girls. From there they took vehicles for the long drive to al-Dabbah.\n\nMany arrived at the camp empty handed. They had left the city carrying almost nothing and had to pay to get through checkpoints.\n\n\"The RSF fighters stripped us of everything we had: money, phones, even our nice clothes,\" Mr Adam said. \"At each stop they would make you call your relatives to transfer money to your mobile phone account before they let you move on to the next checkpoint.\"\n\nThe RSF told the BBC it rejected accusations of systematic abuses against civilians.\n\n\"The specific allegations raised - looting, killings, sexual violence, or mistreatment of civilians - do not reflect our directives,\" said Dr Ibrahim Mukhayer, an adviser to the leader of RSF, Gen Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.\n\n\"Any RSF member proven responsible for wrongdoing will be held fully accountable.\"\n\nHe said the group believed the allegations of widespread atrocities were part of a politically motivated media campaign against them by what he called Islamist elements within Sudan's military-led administration.\n\nThe RSF has published videos to try and reshape the narrative, showing its officers greeting people fleeing el-Fasher, trucks bringing in humanitarian aid, and medical centres being re-opened.\n\nMr Mohamed told the BBC that RSF foot soldiers were more brutal when their officers were not present, while Mr Adam dismissed what he described as attempts by the paramilitary group to improve its image.\n\n\"They have this strategy,\" he said. \"They will gather 10 or 15 people, give us water and film us like they're treating us nicely.\n\n\"Once the cameras are gone, they will start beating us, treating us very badly and take everything we have.\"\n\nEarlier this year the US determined that the RSF had committed genocide in Darfur.\n\nBut the Sudanese armed forces and its allied militias have also been accused of atrocities, including targeting civilians suspected of supporting the RSF, and indiscriminately shelling residential areas.\n\nThis particularly brutal chapter in Sudan's devastating war has drawn US President Donald Trump's attention. He has promised to get more directly involved in ongoing US efforts to broker a ceasefire.\n\nFor those who escaped el-Fasher, that seems a distant prospect. They have been broken again and again by this conflict and have no idea what will come next.\n\nBut they are resilient. Mr Ali had not heard about Trump's sudden interest, he had been chasing officials to get permission to stay in the camp in a tent where, he says, \"we can live and rest\".\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg81p61dnmo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"19:10:41.868+00:00","title":"Stockton mass shooting: Three children among four killed at California family gathering","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tragic mass shooting at a family gathering in Stockton, California, at least four people were killed—including three children aged eight, nine, and 14—while eleven others were injured.

shadowed by Trump aid threats\n\nHondurans have cast their ballots in a general election dominated by threats from US President Donald Trump.\n\nThere are five presidential candidates, but the poll is essentially being seen as a three-way race between former defence minister Rixi Moncada of the leftist Libre party, TV host Salvador Nasralla from the centrist Liberals, and businessman Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura, of the right-wing National Party.\n\nTrump has thrown his support behind Asfura and threatened to cut financial aid to the Central American nation if he does not win.\n\nBut the most recent opinion poll put Nasralla in the lead. Voting passed off peacefully, with only occasional reports of minor irregularities.\n\nVoting was extended for an hour in some places where there were long queues, but most Hondurans it seems were able to cast their votes without issue.\n\nThe main parties and their candidates have all said they will respect the outcome of the election – although the ruling Libre party has said it will not accept a decision based on preliminary results, only on the final count of the paper ballots.\n\nPresidents in Honduras can only serve a single four-year term, so the incumbent, Xiomara Castro, who was the country's first female president when she took office in 2021 for the Libre party, was not on the ballot.\n\nShe has backed Moncada to take her place. The 60-year-old lawyer has pledged to protect \"natural wealth\" from \"21st-century filibusters who want to privatise everything\" if she wins. Moncada has also expressed her commitment to combating corruption \"in all its forms\".\n\nOn Saturday, Moncada accused Trump of meddling in the election, calling his endorsement of her right-wing opponent \"totally interventionist\".\n\nTrump had said that the US would be \"very supportive\" if Tito Asfura won the presidential election, in which voters were also choosing all 128 members of congress and almost 300 local representatives.\n\n\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nThe US sent more than $193m (£146m) to Honduras last fiscal year, according to  the State Department website , and despite aid cuts, has sent more than $102m this year. The Trump Administration has already reportedly cut $167m in economic and governance aid that had been earmarked for 2024 and 2025,  the Congress website says .\n\nIn another post, Trump wrote that he and Asfura, who is the former mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa, could \"work together to fight the Narcocommunists\" and counter drug trafficking.\n\nNasry Asfura has pledged in a series of social media posts to bring \"development and opportunities for everyone\", to \"facilitate foreign and domestic investment into the country\" and \"generate employment for all.\"\n\nHowever, his party has been plagued by scandals and corruption accusations in recent years - including the  sentencing of former party leader and ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández  last year.\n\nHernández was jailed for 45 years in the US on drug-smuggling and weapons charges - a  decision Trump now intends to overturn .\n\nAsfura has carefully tried to distance himself from Hernández. On Friday he told news agency AFP that he has \"no ties\" with the ex-president, and that \"the party is not responsible for his personal actions.\"\n\nThe current frontrunner, though, is 72-year-old Salvador Nasralla, who is running for president for the fourth time.\n\nHe claims that his win in 2017 was stolen due to \"electoral fraud perpetrated by Hernández\". This was never proven and a partial recount found no irregularities, though the decision did spark mass protests across the country.\n\nAccording to his campaign website, Nasralla says his government's main focus would be \"an open economy\", and that he is committed to generating employment. He also says that if he wins, he will sever ties with China and Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Venezuela and the US have escalated recently - the US has built up its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 deadly strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has said the US actions are attempt to oust him.\n\nOn Saturday,  Trump declared that Venezuela's airspace should be considered closed , even though he does not have the power to do that.\n\nBeyond Honduras' relationship with the US, many voters were asking more fundamental questions about this race as they cast their ballots.\n\nWill the vote pass off smoothly and will the results be delivered on time?\n\nWill the ruling Libre party accept defeat and give up power if they lose?\n\nCrucially, will the armed forces, who have been accused of creeping politicisation, remain independent and not aligned with any individual party or politician?\n\nPre-emptive accusations of election fraud, made both by the ruling party and opposition, have sown mistrust in the vote and sparked fears of post-election unrest.\n\nIt prompted the president of the National Electoral Council, Ana Paola Hall, to warn all parties \"not to fan the flames of confrontation or violence\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93wnyxjkxko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"08:45:37.114+00:00","title":"French farm has €90,000 worth of escargot snails stolen","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A French farm, L'Escargot Des Grands Crus in Bouzy, near Reims, suffered a significant theft of €90,000 worth of edible snails, including both fresh and frozen stock and raw materials, during a break-in that occurred overnight into Monday.

2025-11-30T22:41:04.669+00:00\n\nTitle: Pope Leo finds his voice on first foreign trip\n\nPope Leo XIV has arrived in the Lebanese capital Beirut a week after Israeli air strikes hit the Lebanese capital.\n\nFor a man known for being measured and careful in what he does, it seems quite the statement to land in a country so affected by conflict in what is his first foreign trip.\n\nThe Pope has already spent three days in Turkey and, watching his diplomacy at close quarters, we are learning a little more about how he intends to carry out his duties as both spiritual leader and head of state of Vatican City.\n\nPope Leo's interactions with journalists are gentle and softly spoken, and his words always appear thought out and deliberate.\n\nHis predecessor, Pope Francis, often spoke at length to reporters, sometimes very passionately and from the heart.\n\nBut sometimes that meant his aides had the job of risk management, having to explain statements that appeared to be a departure from what the Pope had previously said or a diplomatic faux pas.\n\nPope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.\n\nSix months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.\n\nAt the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.\n\nIn a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.\n\nAs a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.\n\nStanding next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".\n\nAt an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"\n\nOn the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.\n\n\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.\n\nPope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.\n\nThe Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\". There is no question that in Lebanon in particular there has been a great deal of anticipation.\n\n\"It means a lot to me. He could have visited other countries, but he gave priority to Lebanon while it is still at war,\" Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, leader of the Maronite Catholic Church (to which most Lebanese Christians belong) told the BBC.\n\n\"He brings hope when the Lebanese feel abandoned and we feel uplifted,\" he says.\n\nThe Pope's visit here provides a boost to the third of the country that is estimated to be Christian, but all Lebanese have been granted a two-day national holiday and those from all major faiths have welcomed him.\n\nEven Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim political party and militia considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and US, conveyed its greetings.\n\nIn an open letter, the group talked of a \"full welcome\" and \"deep appreciation\" for the Pope's \"honourable presence\". Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too.\n\nWhile in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders.\n\nHe has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.\n\nThere are, of course, limits to the ambition of togetherness.\n\nIn Turkey when the Pope wanted to bring together different Christian traditions to celebrate a time when they had all been united, the Russian Orthodox Church did not send a representative.\n\nThere will always be criticism. Some were left disappointed that the Pope did not use his visit to Turkey to deliver a message to Erdogan about the suppression of opposition or jailing of journalists.\n\nSome in Lebanon are angered that Pope Leo is not visiting those most directly affected by war.\n\n\"No one has even asked about us,\" said Geryes Jabbour, who is from the Christian village of Sarda, near the Israeli border.\n\n\"We are worn out, we have been set back decades, but we are not even on the Pope's mind,\" he said, echoing the views of some others in southern Lebanon.\n\nThat day in May, Leo may have suddenly (and for him perhaps unexpectedly) acquired one of the most powerful moral platforms, but on a human level, he is still a man from South Side Chicago growing into a role where one wrong step could have huge ramifications.\n\nUnlike Pope Francis he does not seem like a man looking to shake things up quickly, but Pope Leo has shown on his first foreign trip that he is finding his voice on the world stage."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g6we59qe4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"09:05:20.399+00:00","title":"Nigeria's kidnapping crisis: 'Too scared to speak' - villagers on living in the midst of bandits","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Nigeria faced a surge in mass school kidnappings, including over 300 students from St Mary’s Catholic School in Papiri village, Niger state, and separate abductions in Borno and Kebbi states.

the parents whose children were abducted 10 days ago from a boarding school in Nigeria are terrified - they do not want to talk to the authorities or journalists in case of reprisals from the kidnappers.\n\n\"If they hear you say anything about them, before you know it they'll come for you. They'll come to your house and take you into the bush,\" one of them told the BBC.  For his safety, the BBC is not identifying him and is calling him Aliyu.\n\nHis young son is one of more 300 students abducted when armed men stormed the grounds of St Mary's Catholic School in Papiri village in the central state of Niger in the early hours of 21 November.\n\nSome of the children taken are as young as five years old. About 250 are still reportedly missing, though state officials have said this number is exaggerated.\n\nThe incident is part of a recent wave of mass abductions in north and central Nigeria - some of which have been blamed on criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", who see kidnapping for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money.\n\n\"Our village is remote, we are close to the bandits,\" explained Aliyu, whose son is still among the missing.\n\n\"It's a three-hour drive to where they hide. We know where they are, but we can't go there ourselves, it's too dangerous.\"\n\nHe is desperate with worry - especially as vulnerable captives kept in forest hideouts have died during previous abductions, whether from sickness or because ransoms have not been paid.\n\n\"I feel so bitter and my wife hasn't eaten for days... We're not happy at all. We need someone to help us to take action.\"\n\nTwo days after the Papiri kidnapping, 12 teenage girls were abducted from Mussa District in the north-eastern Borno state, long the flashphoint of a jihadist insurgency in the region.\n\nThe Nigerian army says the girls were seized by the Islamic State of West Africa (Iswap) group while harvesting crops on their family farmlands, and were subsequently rescued following an \"intelligence-led\" operation.\n\nAnd a few days before the Papiri kidnapping, 25 girls were taken from their school in Maga, which is 200km (125 miles) further north in Kebbi state.\n\nOne of the students escaped before the rest were rescued by the security forces last week from what the authorities said was a \"farm settlement\".\n\nBandits tend to live in cattle camps deep in the bush. The gangs are largely composed of ethnic Fulani people, who are traditionally nomadic herders.\n\nNo details have been released about whether a ransom was paid to free the girls from Maga.\n\nIn fact, it is illegal to pay ransoms in Nigeria. However, if they are not paid hostages can be - and have been - killed.\n\nRelatives tend to crowdfund or in the case of mass school abductions, the authorities are sometimes suspected of negotiating for their release.\n\nNo group has said it was behind these two recent school kidnappings, though the government has recently told the BBC it believes it was jihadists, not bandits, who are responsible. Locals in Kebbi and Niger states are likely to be curious for more information on this.\n\nYusuf, the legal guardian to some of the Maga girls and whose name has also been changed to protect his identity, believes such kidnappings could not have happened without informants in the community.\n\n\"All these abductions are not common in Kebbi. These kidnappings can only happen with the connivance of someone from the community, because no stranger can come to a place and pull something like this off without the help of locals,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"They need the help of someone who knows the terrain very well.\"\n\nBut there has been a surprising change of approach in some areas where villages have been at the mercy of bandits for the last decade and have given up hope of getting help from the security forces.\n\nIt has led some of these rural communities, who live in close proximity to the kidnapping gangs and in the woeful absence of effective policing, to come up with their own solutions.\n\n\"In the north-west, those communities that have been severely affected by these mass kidnappings have struck so-called peace deals with these bandits in exchange for access to mines,\" David Nwaigwe, a security analyst for security risk consulting firm SBM Intelligence, told the BBC.\n\nMany states in the north-west are rich in untapped mineral deposits - especially gold, a profitable prospect for bandit gangs.\n\nThese deals, according to Mr Nwaigwe, have been effective in some areas.\n\n\"What we've seen over time is that there seems to be some sort of a decline in the rate of attacks,\" he said.\n\nKatsina state, in Nigeria's far north, is a case in point. It has long been synonymous with insecurity - particularly banditry and mass kidnappings. But in the past year, things have begun to shift, thanks in part to several peace deals struck between bandit leaders and community leaders.\n\nSitting on mats under the shade of wide trees, representatives from both sides hash out their terms and conditions before eventually coming to an agreement.\n\nBandit leaders have been willing to negotiate, though have faced criticism for attending peace talks armed with AK47 guns and other weapons.\n\nThe area of Jibia was an early adopter of the peace negotiation process, reaching a deal in March this year.\n\nAfter enduring more than 10 years of insecurity, life had become untenable, said community leader and lawyer Ibrahim Sabiu, who represented Jibia during the peace talks.\n\n\"Our homes and sources of livelihood were destroyed,\" he told the BBC in September.\n\n\"Schools and hospitals all closed down. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more kidnapped for ransom.\"\n\nA main stipulation of the peace deal was that the schools re-open. In addition, the community requested a guarantee that they would not be attacked and that bandits would not enter the community with guns.\n\nAs for the bandits in Jibia, they requested access to clean drinking water and safe passage for their cattle as they moved to new grazing pastures.\n\nThey also requested that their women be allowed to buy and trade in local markets.\n\nHigh on the agenda - for both sides - was the release of those kidnapped. The BBC does not know how many people were released in Jibia, but 37 villagers had been freed in Kurfi, another area of Katsina state, by late September - a month after a deal was struck.\n\n\"We had to accept the peace offer because there was no end in sight to the violence,\" said Mr Sabiu.\n\n\"This is a crisis that the police should handle but the security agencies were brought in and yet, they couldn't end it.\"\n\nAudu Abdullahi Ofisa, a bandit leader who took part in the Jibia talks, endorsed the move towards peace: \"Life is full of ups and downs, we are happy to go into another phase.\"\n\nRural communities stand to gain from a return to peace, but what is less immediately obvious is why bandits have entered into peace processes - especially in cases where gold mines were not part of the deals.\n\nAccess to ransom money has traditionally made banditry a lucrative endeavour, yet in Kurfi, it was bandit leaders who requested peace talks.\n\nThey live relatively nomadic lives, which makes access to clean drinking water difficult. It also drives up the prices of food because they are not able to access markets.\n\nLife had become expensive and uncomfortable.\n\n\"We are all tired of violence,\" Nasiru Bosho, one of the bandit leaders who took part in the Kurfi peace negotiations, told the BBC.\n\n\"We were all living together in the same community until the unfortunate violence began. We have agreed to live and let live. No more harassment or kidnapping by either side.\"\n\nThere is also a view that such communities have been bled dry and can no longer come up with ransom payments.\n\nWhile peace deals in the north like those struck in Kurfi and Jibia have yielded tentative security gains, analysts say that this has only shifted insecurity.\n\nSome gangs may find it more rewarding to set their sights on regions further south.\n\n\"As you move further south, people are better off economically,\" said Mr Nwaigwe.\n\n\"The more these gangs push southwards, the more they're likely to find places that they can attack. Parents in those schools are more able to gather enough funds to pay ransoms.\n\n\"In a lot of the north-west whole rural communities have been vacated. Anybody that has the means, has left the rural areas to run towards the major city centres.\"\n\nSome have questioned whether the resurgence in attacks in the last few weeks is linked to Donald Trump's recent threats of military intervention in Nigeria.\n\nThe US president criticised the Nigerian government for failing to adequately protect Christians from attacks by Islamist insurgents.\n\nA jihadist insurgency erupted in the north-east of the country in 2009 - and the kidnapping of more than 200 girls by Boko Haram militants from Chibok 11 years ago was one of the first mass abductions.\n\nThe government and security analysts have been at pains to point out that both Muslims and Christians have been targets in mass kidnappings. For example, the BBC was told the schoolgirls recently abducted from Maga were Muslim.\n\n\"Nigeria's security situation is now very complicated. We don't know how to draw the lines between violent extremist groups or bandits. Because they operate almost in the same areas and in a fluid manner,\" Christian Ani, from the Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC.\n\nHe is not convinced there is a resurgence of high-profile mass kidnapping of schoolchildren because of Trump's comments.\n\n\"They might have ideological motives but they're more motivated by profit,\" he said.\n\nMr Nwaigwe agrees one cannot make a causal link between Trump's comments and the recent uptick in attacks.\n\n\"For now, I just think they're just going after soft targets like schools because they're easy to get money from. It's too early to draw other conclusions,\" he said.\n\nAs far as he is concerned, stopping the violence will require a two-pronged approach - a combination of armed confrontation and negotiating amnesty deals.\n\n\"It's kind of like the stick and carrot approach - show them that you can use overwhelming military force against them, then try to convince the rest to surrender,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think purely using military power is going to work here, you need to complement that with other measures.\"\n\nBut for the parents of Papiri, the prospect of living peacefully with the enemy remains a far-off dream as they pray for their children's safe return.\n\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dn5ygypqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-12-01","timeOfPublication":"00:52:30.162+00:00","title":"Can Prince William's 'ordinary Joe' approach win the monarchy more support?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Public support for the British monarchy is in decline, with a sharp drop from 86% in 1983 to just 51% in the most recent survey.

support?\n\nI've spent much of my career commentating on royal occasions, and over the past two years I've been looking at the institution in close detail for a personal-view documentary series, interviewing former private secretaries and communications advisers, along with royal historians, friends of King Charles III and staunch anti-monarchists, trying to understand how it works and why it has had such a hold on Britain.\n\nNow, polls suggest public approval is in decline.\n\nWhen asked how important it was to continue having a monarchy, as part of the first British Social Attitudes survey back in 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\". In last year's survey, just 51% of people answered the same. The  proportion of young people  approving of the monarchy is lower still.\n\nThat's not to say that people want an elected head of state instead -  a majority don't.  And finding an elected President who could unite Scotland England Wales and Northern Ireland would, I suspect, be a good deal harder than some republicans think.\n\nBut the declining support marks a problem.\n\n\"The only way the monarchy works is by everybody either being apathetic or feeling very affectionate towards it,\" argues Anna Whitelock, a professor of the history of monarchy at City, University of London.\n\n\"If those bonds are broken, there really is no purpose or point of monarchy.\"\n\nPlenty of people might be quick to put the most recent threat to those bonds down to scandal. There is no love lost between  Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor,  as he is now known, and the British public.\n\nOnly 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of him in a YouGov poll in October (the same month he was stripped of his titles), followed by the  Duke and Duchess of Sussex,  with ratings of 30% and 21% respectively.\n\nYet no-one I spoke to while making these films pointed to any one individual as the sole reason for the current standing of the monarchy in the eyes of the public.\n\nI suspect the real challenge facing the Royal Family is the fundamental question of what it stands for in the modern world - a world radically different to the one Elizabeth II reigned over when she ascended the throne in 1952.\n\nEven though there is evidence that suggests change is on the agenda, as the Prince of Wales acknowledged last month, what should he do, as heir to the throne - and what should King Charles do  as reigning monarch  - to win back more support for the institution?\n\nThree monarchs have been on the throne during my lifetime, and each understood that what matters is the impression they make on their subjects: their image.\n\nAs the journalist and editor Ian Hislop put it when I interviewed him for my documentary series, What's The Monarchy For? \"They thrive on the oxygen of public support\".\n\nIt is, ultimately, the key to their survival.\n\nThey surround themselves with people who know this too. Lord Janvrin was the private secretary to the late queen until 2007. \"If you took public support for granted it would be a very bad day,\" he told me.\n\nProf Whitelock takes this a step further. \"The Royal family is a brand,\" she explains. \"There is always a sense of needing to keep the brand popular.\"\n\nOne of the boldest attempts the Royal Family has ever made to redefine its public image - and keep that brand popular - came back in 1969 when, for the first time, they invited cameras into the heart of family life.\n\nThe film, titled Royal Family, which was broadcast on BBC and ITV, was an attempt to try to humanise them.\n\nThe late queen was filmed in colour, buying a treat for a four-year-old Prince Edward in a shop, using money from her purse. \"What are you going to have? A lolly?\" she was filmed saying, briskly. \"An ice cream,\" Edward replied.\n\nAs he settled in the front seat of the car, she suggested he might make a \"gooey mess\".\n\nThere was a picnic scene too, with Prince Philip and the Princess Royal seen barbecuing sausages.\n\nThe public lapped it up. Across both transmissions it had almost twice as many viewers as the first moon landing when it broadcast.\n\nYet a few years later, the late queen is reported to have ordered that it should never be seen again.\n\nSome reports have suggested there were copyright claims, though the Times also reported speculation that there were concerns, or even regrets about it being made.\n\nCertainly Princess Anne didn't mince her words about the recording. \"I never liked the idea of the royal family film,\" she reportedly once said. \"I always thought it was a rotten idea.\"\n\nBut it's a good example of how the Royal Family endeavour to present themselves as they want to be seen.\n\nIn September 2022, I was at Windsor to report on the final stages of  Elizabeth II's funeral.  The Palace issued instructions to the broadcasters about scenes that, once shown live, should never be shown again.\n\nA number were quite small things, for example, the crown being handled, somebody looking visibly upset, Prince George touching his nose, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh's handkerchiefs, and, at the lying in state, shots of the Royal Family mouthing the Lord's Prayer.\n\nThese little excisions from reality - or \"perpetuity edits,\" a kind of George Orwell speak - see them remove from the world anything they don't like.\n\nOn the one hand, they have the right to grieve in private; on the other, the late queen was our head of state and this is her public funeral. Do we have a right to see it all or do they have the right to control what we see?\n\n\"The degree of control I think is staggering,\" argues Prof Whitelock.\n\n\"If Downing Street were trying to control what's being broadcast, that would be reported upon, but if the Palace is intervening in what's being shown about certain things, why is that not seen as something that should be reported?\"\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace has said: \"The events surrounding the funeral of Her Late Majesty were both State occasions and moments of profound personal sorrow for her loved ones. In striking the appropriate balance between those two factors, simple human decency pointed towards a sensitive and sympathetic approach so as not to intrude on elements of individual grief or personal religious observance.\n\n\"In particular, we do not believe it would have been fair or appropriate to focus on younger members of the family at a time of mourning.\"\n\nRecently, Prince William joined forces with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy for an episode of his travel comedy series that aired last month.\n\nMr Levy appeared particularly amused to see his entrance - zipping around Windsor Castle on an e-scooter.\n\n\"It gets around quite nicely,\" the Prince explained, later adding: \"I'm always late so I thought this was a way to keep my meetings on time.\" He chatted on about which of Levy's films he had enjoyed. (\"All of the American Pies!\")\n\nA bright idea - the image getting across is that William is just an ordinary Joe.\n\nThe social media posts that Prince William and his family share to their 17.1 million followers have a similar approach, with many showing them off-duty, with videos shot in woods, on sand dunes. One shows the Princess of Wales sharing her relief at having  finished chemotherapy treatment , and reflecting on the importance \"of simply loving and being loved\".\n\nBritish \"adman\" Rory Sutherland, who has spent 37 years in the heart of the advertising world, currently as vice-chairman of Ogilvy, fully approves of the Waleses' approach to striking a more modern tone.\n\n\"I think he's walked the line, which is a very narrow line between modernity and kind of absurdity extremely well,\" he says of Prince William. \"It is a very delicate path to tread.\"\n\nIt is, he adds, far less crude than one memorable attempt by the generation before him, when Prince Edward, Princess Anne and Andrew took part in It's a Royal Knockout charity tournament in 1987, presiding over teams of celebrities who wore costumes and did challenges like lobbing ham at each other.\n\nAnd it seems to be resonating. Prince William and Catherine have public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively - higher than all other family members in last month's YouGov survey.\n\nProf Whitelock, though positive about Prince William and his fellow senior Royals' attempts to seem more accessible, is less sure about whether that is enough to modernise the institution as a whole.\n\n\"If the monarchy is really to modernise in a significant way, we need to see much more transparency, much more accountability,\" she argues.\n\nIn talking to people as research for my documentary, there seem to me to be other factors, which are potential stumbling blocks to fuller public support.\n\nFirst, the fact that the monarch is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax on his personal income, because the relevant laws do not apply to the Crown, and only does so voluntarily - and that he was not legally obliged to pay inheritance tax after the death of his mother.\n\n\"I think the best way to make those concessions is voluntarily rather than under duress. It's a better look certainly,\" says Rory Sutherland.\n\nA spokesperson for Kensington Palace has also said that the Prince of Wales voluntarily pays the top rate of income and capital gains tax on all his personal income, including receipts from the Duchy.\n\nNo explanation was given, when asked for the documentary series, as to why the Prince of Wales has chosen not to follow his father's example of publishing his tax returns since inheriting the role.\n\nSecond, the fact that the monarch has the right to be consulted on proposed legislation that may affect the Crown and can ask to be excluded from it.\n\nThe question of whether the monarch takes up this right, or the extent to which it may or may not have an impact, are other matters - some have argued that the right in itself gives any monarch potential to influence.\n\nThen there is their lifestyle - particularly  when many people in the country face a cost of living crisis.\n\nMr Sutherland does not believe the fact the royals live in palaces to be something the public particularly cares about. But he adds: \"I always thought that skiing holidays are a bit of a bad look.\"\n\nOf course there is the economic case of the sheer amount of money that the Royal Family brings to the UK thanks to tourism - but Mr Sutherland argues that while \"you can emphatically make an economic case\", it is not the right way to justify the royal's continued existence.\n\nPrince William has been forthright in stating that he has change in mind.\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda… Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen,\" he told Mr Levy.\n\nHe also said: \"There are points when you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\n\n\"So I like to question things, is what I'm really getting at.\"\n\nIt remains unclear exactly what he means by this. Whether it is simply fewer courtiers, a bit less ceremony, no more people calling him sir, or bowing. Or is it possible William envisages much more of a rethink?\n\nThere has been some debate over the years about whether or not there is merit in a bigger shift: in making the British Royal Family more in line with the Dutch royal family, or the Scandinavian ones with a much more informal and modest style.\n\nProf Whitelock for one believes certain parts of it could well appeal to the prince. \"I don't think the idea of dressing up in all the stuff for the coronation is something that appeals to him.\"\n\nBut it comes with risks. \"Those who really support the monarchy like all that comes with it, so if we got to a point where we it looks like the Scandinavian monarchies that don't have big coronations… some people might say 'what's the point now'?\n\n\"If people are asked what defines Britain,\" she adds, \"I'm sure before too long you do get to the monarch.\"\n\nGraham Smith, chief executive of pressure group, Republic, is one of those (albeit in a UK minority) who argue that no amount of reform would be enough to win his approval.\n\n\"You should not have that family in that position of privilege and status,\" he tells me. \"They are just a bunch of very ordinary people, who just happen to be related to people who, hundreds of years ago, built big castles and won a few battles.\n\n\"Essentially, it's a ridiculous institution, which… has no justification.\"\n\nI put to him that over half the country don't think it's ridiculous - many people find it consoling and representative of the United Kingdom, maybe something better than politicians. The newspapers are full of talk about monarchy too.\n\n\"Yes there is an audience,\" he says pointedly. \"But there's also an audience for the Kardashians and David Beckham.\"\n\nI still remember firsthand one of the Royal Family's low points. It was a Sunday in 1997 and I received the news that Diana, Princess of Wales had been killed in the crash in Paris. I was working at the BBC at the time and we were summoned to cover what had happened.\n\nWe had no inkling at the time what the public response would be - but it was soon clear that something astonishing was happening.\n\nThere was an outpouring of popular grief. The press started reporting that thousands of people in London were bringing flowers to Kensington Palace but that the Royal Family had remained up in Balmoral and were not responding.\n\nLord Janvrin was in Balmoral with the late queen. \"A choice had to be made between looking after the two young princes and getting back to London.\"\n\nYet the public criticism was sharp. It was a lesson in the cruel demands of monarchy on those who belong to it. And a lesson to never again get behind the story.\n\nSupport for the monarchy had already been declining. The year after Diana's death, it dipped further, with just 63.5% of people saying it was important for Britain to have a monarchy, according to the British Attitudes Survey.\n\nIt took time for the approval ratings to climb back to their previous levels – but eventually they did, reaching 75% by 2012.\n\nIt shows that this institution can recover from disapproval.\n\n\"It is highly, highly culturally adaptive,\" says Mr Sutherland, \"and obviously an 18th century monarchy might look absurd to us today but at the time it was permanently effectively adapting to changed circumstances, which is one of the reasons it is still around and lots of monarchies aren't.\"\n\nNo matter what changes Prince William makes - nor Prince George after him - the bigger question of what becomes of the monarchy in the distant future may not be theirs to decide.\n\nThe monarchy's existence thrives on the \"oxygen of public support\", so it is the public themselves who will decide through that support whether having this kind of head of state continues to suit us as a country.\n\nDavid Dimbleby's documentary series,  What's the Monarchy For?  starts on Tuesday 2 December on BBC1 and BBC iPlayer\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

A sensation, he said, which could not immediately be washed off.\n\nDemonstrators against the Georgian government's suspension of its European Union accession bid have complained of other symptoms too - shortness of breath, coughing, and vomiting that lasted for weeks.\n\nThe BBC World Service has spoken to chemical weapons experts, whistleblowers from Georgia's riot police, and doctors, and found the evidence points to the use of an agent that the French military named \"camite\".\n\nThe Georgian authorities said our investigation findings were \"absurd\" and the police had acted legally in response to the \"illegal actions of brutal criminals\".\n\nCamite was deployed by France against Germany during World War One. There is little documentation of its subsequent use, but it is believed to have been taken out of circulation at some point in the 1930s, because of concerns about its long-lasting effects. CS gas - often referred to as \"tear gas\" - was used as a replacement.\n\nKonstantine Chakhunashvili was one of those who gathered outside Georgia's parliament in Tbilisi during the first week of protests - which began on 28 November 2024. Demonstrators were incensed by the ruling party's announcement that it was pausing EU accession talks. The goal of EU membership is enshrined in Georgia's constitution.\n\nGeorgia's police responded with a variety of riot-control measures including the use of water cannon, pepper spray and CS gas.\n\nDr Chakhunashvili, a paediatrician who was among those sprayed by the cannons, and who has taken part in many of the demonstrations, said his skin felt like it was burning for days, and the sensation couldn't be washed away. In fact, he said, \"it was worse when trying to wash it off\".\n\nDr Chakhunashvili wanted to find out if others had suffered similar effects. So he appealed, via social media, for those also targeted by crowd control measures during the first week of the demonstrations to fill out a survey. Nearly 350 people got in touch, and almost half said they had suffered one or more side-effects for more than 30 days.\n\nThese long-term symptoms ranged from headaches, to fatigue, coughs, shortness of breath and vomiting.\n\nHis study has since been peer reviewed and has been accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.\n\nSixty-nine of those surveyed by Dr Chakhunashvili were also examined by him and found to have \"significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities\" in the electrical signals in the heart.\n\nDr Chakhunashvili's report echoed the conclusion that local journalists, doctors, and civil rights organisations had come to - that the water cannon must have been laced with a chemical. They had called on the government to identify what had been used, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs - responsible for the police - refused.\n\nSeveral high-level whistleblowers connected to the Special Tasks Department - the official name of Georgia's riot police - helped the BBC determine this chemical's likely identity.\n\nA former head of weaponry at the department, Lasha Shergelashvili, believes it is the same compound he was asked to test for use in water cannon in 2009.\n\nThe effects of that product, he says, were unlike anything he had previously experienced. He found it difficult to breathe after standing close to where it had been sprayed, and he and the 15-20 colleagues who tested it with him could not easily wash it off.\n\n\"We noticed that the effect was not wearing off, as is the case for [regular] tear gas. Even after we washed our faces with water, and then with a special solution of baking soda and water, which was prepared in advance, we still couldn't breathe freely.\"\n\nMr Shergelashvili says that as a result of his tests, he recommended against the chemical's use. But he says the water cannon vehicles were nevertheless loaded with it - and that this remained the case at least up until 2022, when he quit his job and left the country.\n\nSpeaking from his new home in Ukraine, he tells the BBC that when watching footage of the protests last year, he immediately suspected that demonstrators were being subjected to the same chemical.\n\nColleagues he has remained in touch with, and who are still in post, have also told him this is the case, he adds.\n\nAnd the BBC spoke to another former high-level police officer who confirmed that whatever was loaded into the water cannon vehicles when Mr Shergelashvili was in position was the same compound deployed in the protests of November-December 2024.\n\nWhen Mr Shergelashvili was asked if the product he tested could have just been CS gas - which irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory system, but only temporarily -  he said it appeared to be far stronger than that.\n\n\"I cannot name an example or compare it with anything [else],\" he said, adding it was \"probably 10 times\" stronger than more conventional riot-control agents.\n\n\"For example, if you spill this chemical on the ground, you won't be able to stay in that area for the next two to three days, even if you wash it off with water.\"\n\nMr Shergelashvili does not know the name of the chemical he was asked to test.\n\nBut the BBC managed to obtain a copy of the inventory of the Special Tasks Department, dated December 2019.\n\nWe discovered it contained two unnamed chemicals. These were simply listed as \"Chemical liquid UN1710\" and \"Chemical powder UN3439\", along with instructions for how they should be mixed.\n\nWe wanted to check whether this inventory was authentic, so we showed it to another  former high-ranking police officer from the riot police who confirmed it seemed genuine. He identified the two unnamed chemicals as those likely to have been added into the water cannon.\n\nOur next step was to work out what these chemicals were.\n\nUN1710 was easy to identify as this is the code for trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent that enables other chemicals to dissolve in water. We then had to work out which chemical it was helping to dissolve.\n\nUN3439 was much harder to identify because it is an umbrella code for a whole range of industrial chemicals, all of which are hazardous.\n\nThe only one of these we found to have ever been used as a riot-control agent is bromobenzyl cyanide, also known as camite, developed by the Allies for use in World War One.\n\nWe asked Prof Christopher Holstege, a world leading toxicology and chemical weapons expert, to assess whether our evidence pointed to camite being the likely agent used.\n\nBased on the results of Dr Chakhunashvili's study, victim testimony, the riot police inventory, and Mr Shergelashvili's account of the chemical tests, Prof Holstege believes that this is the case.\n\n\"Based on the available evidence… the clinical findings reported by both those exposed and by other witnesses are consistent with bromobenzyl cyanide.\"\n\nHe ruled out the likelihood of the symptoms being caused by more conventional crowd control measures, such as CS gas, which was also being deployed by Georgia's riot police last year.\n\n\"The persistence of the clinical effects… is not consistent with the typical agents used for crowd dispersal, such as CS,\" he said.\n\n\"I've never seen camite being utilised in modern society. Camite is markedly irritating [and] persistent with its irritation.\"\n\nHe speculated it would have been used because it would act as a strong deterrent.\n\n\"It would keep people away for a long time. They couldn't decontaminate [themselves]. They would have to go to the hospital. They would have to leave the area. If that is indeed the case - that this chemical has been brought back - that is actually exceedingly dangerous.\"\n\nCamite was briefly used as a riot control agent by the American police post-World War One, but was abandoned after safer options such as CS gas were invented.\n\nUnder international law, police forces are allowed to use chemicals as crowd-control agents as long as they are considered proportionate and have only short-term effects.\n\nGiven there are safer and more conventional riot-control agents available to police, an obsolete and more potent agent could be classed as a chemical weapon, according to weapons experts consulted by the BBC.\n\nOur findings were concerning, said UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Edwards. Ms Edwards has previously written to Georgia's government regarding allegations of police violence and torture during the protests.\n\nThe lack of strict regulation around the use of chemicals in water cannon is a problem she would like addressed: \"It does lead me to consider [this practice] as an experimental weapon. And populations should never be subjected to experiments. This is absolutely in violation of human rights law.\"\n\nShe stressed that any effect of a riot control measure should be temporary under international law, and that the symptoms described \"are beyond what would be considered temporary and acceptable. So all of those cases should be investigated, including under the rubric of torture or other ill-treatment\".\n\nGeorgia's authorities described our findings as \"deeply frivolous\" and \"absurd\".\n\nIt said that law enforcement had acted \"within the bounds of the law and constitution\" when responding to the \"illegal actions of brutal criminals\".\n\nThe protests on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue have dwindled in their size since the government increased fines and jail terms, but not in their frequency.\n\nAlmost every night for the past year , demonstrators have called for the resignation of a government they accuse of rigging elections, siding with Russian interests, and passing increasingly draconian legislation against civil society.\n\nThe ruling Georgian Dream party denied the government or the party's honorary chairman, Bidzina Ivanishvili, are either pro-Russian or pursuing Russian interests. It told the BBC that legislative changes over the past year served the best interests of \"public welfare\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34yk7z6yxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"12:13:41.891+00:00","title":"Hong Kong fire: Death toll rises to 146 as thousands pay their respects","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A devastating fire at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district on 23 November 2025 killed at least 146 people, making it the deadliest fire in the city in over 70 years.

the devastating fire that tore through high-rise buildings in Hong Kong on Wednesday.\n\nPolice announced the new death toll on Sunday, cautioning that they \"cannot rule out the possibility of further fatalities\". There are still 150 people missing, and the blaze left 79 injured.\n\nSeven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the northerly Tai Po district rapidly went up in flames. Accusations that the fire was spread by flammable construction materials have sparked widespread anger.\n\nThree days of national mourning started on Saturday, and thousands have gathered at the scene to mourn the victims.\n\nThere have been queues stretching a long as 2km (1.2 miles), as people wait to lay flowers and handwritten notes.\n\nIndonesian worker Romlah Rosidah said she was \"very surprised\" at how many people had turned up to pray for the victims.\n\n\"This event was only spread on social media, but [it] turned out their hearts moved,\" she told news agency Reuters.\n\nA Filipino worker said they had joined the prayers to \"show the Hong Kong community that we are one in this situation\".\n\nOfficials observed three minutes' silence to begin the mourning period, and the flags of China and Hong Kong are flying at half-staff.\n\nThe fire is Hong Kong's deadliest in more than 70 years, and the death toll has been rising each day, as officials work to recover and identify bodies.\n\nThe exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovations that had been taking place on the towers, while three others were detained on manslaughter charges.\n\nThe fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.\n\nThe same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.\n\nPolice official Tsang Shuk-yin said on Sunday that officers had so far completed searches of four of the tower blocks.\n\nIndonesia's consulate in Hong Kong said at least seven of its nationals had died from the fire, while the Philippines' consulate said one of its citizens had died.\n\nFirefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.\n\nThe fire department said the blaze had reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F), and 12 firefighters were injured.\n\nThe flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on plastic netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.\n\nThe buildings were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction work in Hong Kong. The fire has renewed a debate about whether it should still be used.\n\nSeveral residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.\n\nThe Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption investigation included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors.\n\nA police spokesperson previously said they had reason to believe \"those in charge at the company were grossly negligent\", which led to the fire and caused it to \"spread uncontrollably\".\n\nHong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.\n\nSeparately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire.\n\nWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.\n\nNearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.\n\nHong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.   The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq26x0dd6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"19:46:23.965+00:00","title":"Sri Lanka declares state of emergency after floods leave hundreds dead and many missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sri Lanka has declared a state of emergency following devastating floods and mudslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, resulting in over 330 deaths, more than 200 missing, and the destruction of over 20,000 homes.

expertly inspects a worn, yellow 100 shekel ($30.50; £23.10) note. He straightens it out and enhances its faded colour with careful strokes of a pencil.\n\nBaraa Abu al-Aoun should have been studying at university - but instead he ekes out a living from a table he has set up at the roadside, taking a small sum to help keep cash in circulation.\n\nFixing banknotes is a thriving new business in Gaza.\n\nEver since the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023 and the devastating war that ensued, Israel stopped transfers of banknotes, along with most other supplies.\n\nMost banks were destroyed in Israeli strikes, and many were looted. While some branches have reopened since a ceasefire took effect seven weeks ago, there are still no working ATMs.\n\nBut people need cash to buy food and essentials. That has forced them to turn to informal money merchants who charge enormous commissions to turn digital transfers into cash. It has also sparked a huge increase in the use of e-wallets and money transfer apps.\n\nAnd it means that every existing banknote matters more than ever - no matter how tattered. That's where Baraa comes in. \"My tools are simple: a ruler, pencils, coloured pencils and glue,\" he says.\n\n\"The ceasefire hasn't changed the financial situation. What I do now is to serve people and help them.\"\n\nGaza's economic collapse has been so catastrophic during two years of intense war that a new UN report says its entire population of more than two million has been pushed into poverty.\n\nFour in five people are now unemployed according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), and even those who still have an income or savings struggle to access cash.\n\n\"It's pure suffering and nothing else,\" says Numan Rayhan, who is displaced in Gaza City from Jabalia in northern Gaza with few belongings. \"Shortage of income, shortage of money, no cash flow from the banks.\"\n\nEarly in the war, Israeli strikes targeted banks, which Israeli officials alleged were linked to Hamas. Their vaults were looted by armed Palestinian gangs, some presumed to have been Hamas. The Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) has previously said that cash worth about $180m (£136m) was stolen.\n\nCogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's border crossings, confirmed that in line with a political order \"and due to Hamas's reliance on cash to maintain its military activity\", Israel has not been allowing cash to enter Gaza.\n\nThe lack of cash circulating has \"caused problems for both sellers and buyers\", says Zakaria Ajour, a stall-holder at another market in Gaza City. People don't want to accept worn and delicate notes at face value any more, \"if there are even small scratches or pieces of tape on a note.\n\n\"Some customers come to me just because they want small change for transport, but I don't have change,\" Mr Ajour goes on. \"Ten-shekel coins are barely found, and even when they are, they have virtually no value because of inflation due to the cash crisis.\"\n\nNow, there are long lines outside the Bank of Palestine in Gaza City, one of nine branches of five banks that have reopened. Customers can only reactivate frozen accounts, open new ones, or sign on to banking apps.\n\nAsmaa al-Ladaa wants to set up an account so that she can receive money directly from her relatives living outside Gaza.\"The whole process is just chaos and crowds,\" she says. \"We woke up at 06:00 and left our children behind in a tent. We left everything just to come to the bank.\"\n\nIn the southern city of Khan Younis, where the banks are too badly damaged to reopen, Abu Khalil has just returned from a trek to central Gaza. After spending much of the day queuing, he did not manage to enter the bank there, and despairs at the idea of having to go back again.\n\nThe grandfather still receives a monthly salary of about 2,000 shekels ($612; £463) from the Palestinian Authority, but says that almost half of his income goes on charges he pays to vendors or money merchants. \"You have to pay the fees.  There's no alternative,\" he complains.\n\nDuring the war, adapting to the urgent need for cash, many small businessmen who previously offered money transfer and exchange services began charging customers high commission to turn electronic transfers into cash. On occasion it has reached 50%, although it has recently dropped.\n\nOne money merchant, who wishes to remain anonymous, tells us that market forces determine commission rates. \"Our work is directly tied to market activity and the entry of goods and aid,\" he says. \"When there's an inflow of goods, and active buying and selling, the commission drops significantly, sometimes down to as low as 20%. But when the crossings close, the rate rises.\"\n\nElectronic transfers through bank apps - for which shop and stall owners charge minor fees - have become a popular workaround for Gazans making purchases, even of small items.\n\nThe PMA, which acts as a financial regulator, has launched a payment system allowing instant transactions between local bank accounts. For those without accounts, The Bank of Palestine offers e-wallets and says there are now more than 500,000 users in Gaza. These transactions can be done without an internet connection or app, using text services on any mobile phone.\n\nE-wallets are being used to send financial aid directly to needy families, by humanitarian agencies including Unicef and the World Food Programme. Since early last year, Unicef says it has been able to make cash transfers to about a million people - half of them children. It prioritises vulnerable children, including amputees and orphans, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.\n\n\"Basically, you can go to the grocery store and the phone is used as a payment card, you can buy with it,\" explains Jonathan Crickx from Unicef. \"That allows a very high traceability of how the money is actually spent. From what we observed, 99% of all beneficiaries are spending first on food and water, second is hygiene items, like soap, and third is electricity through generators.\"\n\nMr Crickx says he has personally witnessed families having to buy 2kg (4.4lb) of tomatoes for about $80, and 5kg (11lb) of onions for $70.\n\nHanan Abu Jahel, who is displaced from Gaza City and lives in a camp in al-Zawaideh in central Gaza with her extended family, recently received 1,200 shekels ($367) from Unicef. She used it to buy basics like rice, lentils and pasta.\n\nBut she says: \"My children need vegetables, fruits, meat and eggs. My youngest son especially craves eggs, but I can't get them as prices are still so high and I have to cover the needs of 12 people.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan promises an \"economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza\", convening \"a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities of the Middle East\".\n\nIt envisages new investments and \"exciting development ideas\" that can \"create jobs, opportunity and hope for future Gaza\". But there are no details about how to begin to generate growth and stability, just as the UN's trade agency warns that the strip is going through the most severe economic crisis ever recorded.\n\nBack in Gaza City, Baraa Abu al-Aoun holds the banknote he has been working on up to the light. expertly. He has more customers waiting, attracted by his sign promising repairs \"with high professionalism and without adhesive tape\".\n\nAs Baraa toils on, he longs for a return to a normal life with prospects of more profitable employment.\n\n\"I just want this war to end fully,\" he says.  \"My hope is to feel relief at last, so that I can study and work with a degree.\n\n\"In Gaza, we're just surviving.  We're not human beings anymore.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz82z7p8zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-30","timeOfPublication":"16:06:28.492+00:00","title":"Indonesia searches for hundreds missing in deadly floods","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly series of floods and landslides caused by the rare tropical storm Cyclone Senyar have devastated parts of Indonesia, particularly in Sumatra, resulting in over 440 deaths and hundreds of missing persons.

searching for at least 400 people who have been reported missing, many believed to be buried under landslides, after cyclonic rains caused disastrous flooding nearly a week ago.\n\nThe death toll on the island of Sumatra has risen to more than 440, the government says.\n\nAid has been sent into affected areas by air and by sea, but some villages have yet to receive anything, and there are reports of people stealing food and water to survive.\n\nTorrential rain and storms have devastated parts of Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, affecting millions of people and leaving more than 900 dead across the region this month.\n\nAn exceptionally rare tropical storm, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.\n\nPeople are missing in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra, the National Disaster Management Agency said.\n\n\"There are two cities that require full attention due to being isolated, namely Central Tapanuli and Sibolga,\" agency head Suharyanto was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Ships were expected in Sibolga on Monday, he added.\n\nSome foreign aid has arrived, with Malaysia sending medical supplies to Aceh, one of the worst-hit provinces.\n\nIn Sungai Nyalo village, about 100km (62 miles) from West Sumatra's capital Padang, floodwaters had mostly receded on Sunday, leaving homes, vehicles and crops coated in thick grey mud, AFP reports.\n\nThe authorities had not yet begun clearing roads, residents said, and no outside assistance had arrived.\n\n\"Most villagers chose to stay; they didn't want to leave their houses behind,\" Idris, 55, told the news agency.\n\nPolice spokesperson Ferry Walintukan said there were reports of people breaking into shops on Sumatra, and police had been sent in to restore order, the Associated Press news agency reported.\n\n\"The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,\" Mr Walintukan added. \"Residents] didn't know that aid would come and were worried they would starve.\"\n\nIn another development, tech billionaire Elon Musk said he would provide free Starlink services to support communications during the emergency.\n\nThere has been widespread devastation across the region.\n\nAt least 170 people died in floods in  Thailand  and there were several deaths reported in  Malaysia .\n\nIn  Sri Lanka , more than 330 people died from floods and mudslides as the country grappled with one of its worst weather disasters in years.\n\nWhile the torrential rains have now subsided, low-lying areas of the capital, Colombo, are still flooded and many areas in the centre of the country remain cut off.\n\nIn the  Philippines , tens of thousands of people joined protests against government corruption on Sunday, for the second time this month, following a series of disastrous floods which killed more than 200 people.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that substantial funds meant to finance flood control have been lost through corruption.\n\nPublic anger over the issue now threatens the administration of President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.\n\nThere were two large protests in the capital Manila, one organised by the Roman Catholic Church and the other by unions, students and left-wing activists.\n\nTheir complaint is the same – that money designated by the central government for flood defences was diverted into the pockets of corrupt politicians, leaving many communities dangerously exposed to this year's exceptionally heavy rainfall.\n\nBut determining who is responsible is proving harder. Marcos Jr has sacked several politicians and officials he blames for stealing flood funds.\n\nHowever, one of those politicians, who is now in hiding, has accused the president himself of supervising the corruption - Marcos Jr has dismissed that as propaganda.\n\nHis own sister, Senator Imee Marcos, has now joined opposition to him, and Vice-President Sara Duterte, a bitter rival of the president, says she is ready to take over should he be forced to resign. However, she too faces different corruption allegations.\n\nMuch now depends on whether the protests continue in the coming weeks and whether any more of the president's allies desert him.\n\nHe will be mindful that two of his predecessors, including his father, were ousted by popular protest movements stirred up by corruption."}]}
