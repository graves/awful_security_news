  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan accuses Pakistan of breaking a 48-hour ceasefire by launching air attacks on Paktika province, killing at least 10 civilians, including two children, and injuring 12 others. The attacks come after a period of intense border clashes and a suicide bombing in Pakistan’s FATA region, prompting Pakistan to conduct airstrikes targeting the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, a faction linked to the Pakistan Taliban. The Afghan government has responded by announcing crisis talks in Doha, attended by high-level delegations from both nations, including Afghan Defence Minister Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob and Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and intelligence chief General Asim Malik. The Afghanistan Cricket Board reported that three cricketers and five others were killed during a gathering in Urgun district, leading to the withdrawal from a planned T20I series. The conflict is rooted in mutual accusations: Pakistan claims Afghanistan harbors TTP militants, while Afghanistan denies this and accuses Pakistan of initiating attacks. The violence has destabilized communities, with civilians expressing fear and mixed emotions, and UNAMA reports over 37 deaths and 425 injuries on the Afghan side. This event marks a critical escalation in cross-border tensions, threatening to undermine fragile peace efforts and impacting civilian life, sports, and diplomatic relations.",
