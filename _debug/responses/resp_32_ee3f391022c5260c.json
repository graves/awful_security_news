  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, aged 68, was sentenced to death in Indonesia in 2013 for smuggling 3.8 kilograms of cocaine, a sentence upheld by Indonesia’s highest court. She has been imprisoned on Bali since 2012, and her case gained global attention due to her age and health, with medical experts noting her serious illness. In a repatriation deal signed in October 2025 between the United Kingdom and Indonesia—led by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Indonesian Minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra—Sandiford and another foreign prisoner, Iranian national Shahab Shahabadi (a life sentence holder from 2014), were spared from execution. This agreement reflects a broader international effort to prevent capital punishment for foreigners, especially in countries like Indonesia where drug-related death sentences are common. Indonesia, under President Prabowo Subianto, has previously repatriated other foreign nationals, including a Filipina facing the death penalty and five Australians convicted of heroin trafficking. The UNODC highlights Indonesia as a major drug smuggling hub despite strict laws, due to organized crime targeting youth. With around 530 people currently on Indonesia’s death row—nearly 100 of them foreigners—the repatriation is a significant human rights development.",
