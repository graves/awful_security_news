  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Israeli military announced that the Red Cross has received two coffins containing the remains of deceased Israeli hostages captured during hostilities in Gaza, as part of a ceasefire agreement under the Trump administration. The bodies have not been formally identified, and the Israeli military has urged public sensitivity and patience for official identification. Hamas had previously returned 13 bodies—now all formally identified—under the agreement, but Israeli intelligence raises concerns that it may not be able to recover all remaining dead hostages due to rubble and destruction. One prior body was misidentified, suggesting possible operational difficulties. The U.S. Vice President JD Vance visited Israel and emphasized the importance of recovering bodies for families, noting the difficulty and complexity of the task. The situation reflects both the humanitarian urgency and the political fragility of the ceasefire, with both sides accusing each other of violations and the process being described as not happening overnight.",
