  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China's economy slowed to 4.8% growth in the third quarter of 2025, its weakest pace in a year, amid persistent property market weaknesses and escalating trade tensions with the United States. The slowdown follows China's imposition of export controls on rare earth minerals, a move that prompted US President Donald Trump to threaten additional 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Despite this, China's industrial output and service sectors—particularly in electric vehicles, robotics, and IT services—showed resilience, while government measures such as subsidies and wage increases have supported domestic demand. However, the property sector continues to suffer, with real estate investment down 13.9% and home prices falling nationwide. Experts warn that without stronger policy support, growth is unlikely to exceed 4.8% this year. The latest data will inform upcoming policy decisions by China's top leaders, including the formulation of a new Five-Year Plan to guide economic strategy through 2030.",
