  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has called for urgent improvements to global early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capacity. This gap has led to a dramatic rise in disaster-related deaths—particularly in developing nations, where 90% of such deaths have occurred over the past 50 years. Despite progress in early-warning systems, with 108 countries now using some form of multi-hazard alerts (up from 52), assessments reveal that half of 62 surveyed countries have only basic systems and 16% have less. The situation is most dire in fragile or conflict-affected regions. The article highlights recent extreme weather events in 2025—including floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US—as evidence of the growing global threat. It also emphasizes a real-world success: the evacuation of Switzerland’s Blatten village in May 2025 due to a monitored glacier collapse, underscoring the life-saving potential of early warnings. Experts warn that permafrost melt will increase instability, making robust early-warning systems not just beneficial, but essential for global safety.",
