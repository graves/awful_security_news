  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, citing growing internal disagreements over Gaza policy and military strategy, particularly Hanegbi’s opposition to a full military takeover of Gaza City and his advocacy for a partial deal with Hamas. Hanegbi, who held key ministerial roles in public security and intelligence, publicly took responsibility for the failures that led to the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation, which the Netanyahu government has yet to establish. In response, Netanyahu has appointed Gil Reich, deputy head of the NSC, as acting head of the National Security Council. The move has been criticized by opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who argue it reflects a pattern of political evasion and replacement of dissenting voices with loyalists, signaling a significant shift in Israel’s national security leadership amid ongoing tensions over Gaza and accountability.",
