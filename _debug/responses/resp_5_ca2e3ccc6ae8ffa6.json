  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supports presidential deference in such actions, particularly after similar deployments in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that protests against ICE agents constitute 'violent resistance' and that the president must have broad discretion to respond. However, Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit have blocked the deployment, asserting that protests are not riots and that local law enforcement is sufficient. The Department of Justice invokes the 1827 precedent of Martin v. Mott to assert that the president has exclusive authority to determine exigent circumstances. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision soon, with its ruling likely to influence future National Guard deployments across the U.S. in response to protests.",
