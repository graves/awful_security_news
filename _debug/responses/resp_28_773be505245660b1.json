The new space, designed with gold finishes and neoclassical elements, will be built over the area traditionally used by first ladies and is funded by Trump and private donors. The project fulfills a 15-year ambition to expand the White House’s entertaining capacity and reflects Trump’s personal aesthetic, reminiscent of his private clubs. The White House defended the changes by referencing historical renovations, such as the 1950s Truman-era rebuild, to argue that structural modernization is a long-standing, acceptable practice. The construction was highlighted during a public event celebrating LSU baseball, and White House officials responded to criticism with historical comparisons and appeals to tradition.",
