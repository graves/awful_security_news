    "The mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008, remains unexplained, with two leading theories: pulsars (old stars) and dark matter annihilation.",
    "Prior to this study, the glow's shape — matching the galactic bulge — seemed to support the pulsar theory, as dark matter was expected to produce a more spherical glow.",
    "New supercomputer simulations show that dark matter in the Milky Way may have a squashed, egg-shaped distribution, which closely matches the observed glow's shape, lending support to the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "Joseph Silk and colleagues, from Johns Hopkins University, publish a study in Physical Review Letters suggesting a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter, compared to older stars.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to launch in 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data and could definitively determine whether the glow is from dark matter or pulsars.",
    "WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) remain a leading dark matter candidate, as their annihilation could produce gamma rays. Experiments like the LZ Dark Matter Experiment in South Dakota are searching for such particles.",
    "While the new simulations do not provide definitive proof, they reopen the possibility that dark matter — particularly WIMPs — could explain the galactic glow, keeping the long-standing dark matter mystery alive and scientifically compelling."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008, has long been a puzzle. Scientists have proposed two main explanations: that it comes from pulsars (remnants of exploded stars) or from dark matter annihilation. While previous observations favored pulsars due to the glow’s bulge-like shape, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk show that dark matter could have a squashed, egg-shaped distribution in the galactic center — closely matching the observed glow. This strengthens the dark matter hypothesis, suggesting a 50% chance it is responsible. Despite the lack of direct detection, the study supports ongoing efforts to find dark matter particles like WIMPs, with future data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin in 2027, offering a definitive resolution to the mystery. The article underscores the enduring scientific importance of dark matter, a fundamental yet elusive component of the universe.",
