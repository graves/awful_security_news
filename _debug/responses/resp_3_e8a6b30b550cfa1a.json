  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Billy Joe Cagle, a convicted felon with a history of marijuana possession, was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted authorities that he was armed and planned to 'shoot it up'. Though he was not armed at the time of arrest, police discovered an AR-15 assault rifle in his vehicle. Cagle had already arrived at the airport and was observed near the heavily crowded TSA check-in area, which could have led to a mass casualty incident. Authorities, including the Atlanta Police Department and the FBI, responded quickly, with Cartersville police initiating the alert. The incident underscores the dangers of combining mental health challenges with firearm access, especially at one of the world’s busiest airports. The FBI and U.S. Homeland Security are involved, and officials like Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have emphasized the tragedy averted through early reporting and swift action.",
