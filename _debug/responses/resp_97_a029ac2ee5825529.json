  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration's imposition of steep tariffs — including a 50% duty on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia — has significantly raised the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to a 21% year-over-year increase in retail coffee prices. As the U.S. imports over 99% of its coffee, with Brazil being the largest supplier, roasters such as Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting are facing rising costs, with consumers ultimately bearing the financial burden. Despite efforts by some businesses to diversify sourcing and political proposals like the bipartisan 'No Coffee Tax Act' to exempt coffee from tariffs, consumers are adapting through brand switching or reduced quality expectations. However, coffee remains perceived as an affordable luxury, and consumption habits are not expected to shift dramatically, even with price increases.",
