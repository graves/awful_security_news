  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mark Zuckerberg, along with Evan Spiegel and Adam Mosseri, has been ordered to testify in a landmark trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court, where social media companies are accused of designing addictive apps that negatively impact young people’s mental health. The case, which consolidated hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, alleges that companies knowingly maintained features like 'like' alerts and weak parental controls despite knowing of mental health risks. Though Meta and Snap previously argued under federal law that they are not liable for user-generated content, Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled that negligence in design and personal injury claims still apply. The judge emphasized that CEO testimony is crucial to evaluate whether executives were aware of the harms and failed to take preventive action. This case is part of a broader legal and political scrutiny of social media’s influence on youth, with TikTok and YouTube also named in the suit. Instagram has introduced teen-specific accounts with content filtering and parental controls, but legal pressure demands accountability for design choices.",
