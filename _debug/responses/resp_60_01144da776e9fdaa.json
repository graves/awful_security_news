  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on October 20, 2025, lasting several hours and affecting numerous websites and apps, including banking, social media, and online shopping platforms. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented access to AWS-hosted databases like DynamoDB and virtual servers like EC2. While the outage was not a cyberattack, it highlighted the fragility of the internet’s infrastructure due to its overreliance on a small number of cloud providers. Experts note that such outages—though infrequent—have increased in visibility due to their massive impact, echoing past events like the 2024 CrowdStrike software bug and AT&T’s network failures. The incident underscores the urgent need for better redundancies and distributed infrastructure to ensure resilience in the global digital ecosystem.",
