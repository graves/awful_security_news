  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump, no commitment was made to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, despite Zelensky's request for them as a means to weaken Russia’s war economy. Trump expressed caution, citing escalation risks and stating that the US needs the missiles for its own defense. Zelensky proposed a drone-for-missile trade and suggested a ceasefire along the current front line, emphasizing the need for peace and security. The meeting coincided with a prior phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who agreed to a face-to-face summit in Hungary. Trump claimed the call was productive and suggested Putin wants a deal, while warning that missile supply could further strain US-Russia relations. Zelensky highlighted the importance of European support and called for unity to protect lives and guarantee Ukraine’s security. The event underscores a tense diplomatic moment in the war, with weapons, peace negotiations, and regional stability at the center of the conversation.",
