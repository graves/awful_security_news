  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s proposal to reduce U.S. beef prices by importing more meat from Argentina has faced strong criticism from U.S. ranchers and agricultural experts. While Argentina currently contributes only about 2% of U.S. beef imports, economists argue that even doubling this would have minimal impact on grocery prices. The U.S. beef market is currently strained by strong demand and the smallest herd size since 1961, due to droughts and low prices. Tariffs on Brazil and export limits from Mexico have also reduced overall beef imports. Ranchers fear that the policy introduces uncertainty, discouraging investment in cattle, and believe it contradicts Trump’s stated goal of supporting domestic production. Although Argentine producers welcome new demand, experts warn that over-exporting could raise prices domestically in Argentina. The administration, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, maintains that it supports ranchers and will continue efforts to boost domestic beef production through land expansion and trade deals. Ranchers remain divided, with some hoping Trump will reconsider the policy.",
