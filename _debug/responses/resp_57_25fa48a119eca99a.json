  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A bomb exploded outside the home of Italian investigative journalist Sigfrido Ranucci in Campo Ascolano, south of Rome, damaging two cars and a nearby house but causing no injuries. Ranucci, host of RAI’s influential investigative program 'Report,' has long been under police protection due to threats related to his reporting. The incident, which occurred about 20 minutes after he returned home, has prompted an investigation by anti-Mafia prosecutors into whether the attack involved mafia-style methods. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the act as intimidation against press freedom, while Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi announced increased police protection for Ranucci. The 'Report' program has frequently clashed with Meloni’s government, leading to legal actions by key coalition members, highlighting the broader political and media tensions in Italy.",
