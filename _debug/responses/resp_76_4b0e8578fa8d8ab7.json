  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article analyzes the evolving diplomatic relationship between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, highlighting a notable shift in tone and strategy. While Trump initially expressed interest in supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles—raising concerns about escalation—he quickly downplayed the threat, suggesting a ceasefire along current battle lines. The article underscores Ukraine’s battlefield resilience, with key cities like Pokrovsk and Kupiansk remaining under Ukrainian control despite Russian offensives. It also notes that Putin faces mounting pressure from military failures, economic strain, and lack of international support, especially as India faces US sanctions over Russian oil purchases. Zelensky is now pivoting from advocating for NATO membership to promoting Ukraine's advanced drone technology as a strategic asset. Despite Trump’s ambiguous and somewhat contradictory statements, the article concludes that Ukraine’s real prize—a sustainable peace—remains out of reach, though battlefield dynamics and shifting global alliances offer new possibilities.",
