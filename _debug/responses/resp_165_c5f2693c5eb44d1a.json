This intervention follows a series of geopolitical actions, including US export controls on companies linked to Wingtech and China’s export restrictions on rare-earth metals and components from Nexperia China operations. The Dutch government has imposed a one-year ban on key corporate decisions and asset relocations, while ensuring daily production continues. In response, Nexperia has suspended Zhang and appointed Stegan Tilger as interim CEO. Wingtech has dismissed the move as politically motivated, and China has criticized the action as discriminatory and based on geopolitical bias. The European Union is now coordinating with the Netherlands to protect key technological capabilities in Europe, highlighting growing tensions over semiconductor supply chains and national security in the global tech race.",
