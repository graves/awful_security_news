  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products that would warn about a potential link between use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that such use increases neurodevelopmental risks, the FDA and major medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists state there is no clear scientific evidence of a causal link. A study analyzing 46 studies found only an association, not causation, and a large-scale study of over 2 million children found no significant risk. Regulatory bodies in the EU, UK, and Canada affirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Kenvue argues that label changes are unsupported by science and would be arbitrary, and the FDA has not updated its position or found evidence of harm. The controversy highlights tensions between political messaging and medical science in public health policy.",
