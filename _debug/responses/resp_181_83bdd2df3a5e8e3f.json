  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage in October 2025 exposed the global vulnerability of digital services due to over-reliance on US cloud providers, particularly AWS and Microsoft Azure. In the UK, critical institutions such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC were severely impacted, prompting renewed debate about market concentration. Experts warn that the interconnected 'nested dependency' between platforms and cloud infrastructure creates systemic risk, especially when outages occur. While US providers offer economic and technical advantages through scale and resilience, their dominance raises concerns about national security, political interference, and digital sovereignty. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has called for action, including designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition. Experts and policymakers now advocate for regulatory measures—such as mandating multi-cloud usage and continuous data replication—to build resilience and diversify the UK’s cloud ecosystem.",
