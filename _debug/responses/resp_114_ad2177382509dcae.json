  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New Jersey is embroiling in a closely contested gubernatorial race between Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite being a historically blue state. The race has intensified with personal attacks: Sherrill accuses Ciattarelli of downplaying opioid dangers and causing thousands of deaths, while Ciattarelli claims Sherrill was barred from walking at her naval academy graduation due to a cheating scandal. National figures, including President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama, have endorsed the candidates, with Trump’s support boosting Ciattarelli’s campaign. However, voters’ primary concern remains affordability, with rising electricity and property taxes at the forefront. Both candidates are emphasizing economic policy, and political experts note that New Jersey has a long history of purple gubernatorial elections, with no party having won three consecutive terms since the 1960s. If Sherrill wins, she would be the first woman since the 1960s to lead New Jersey from the same party three times in a row.",
