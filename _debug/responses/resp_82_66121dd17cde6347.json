  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two cases of clade I mpox have been confirmed in California — one in Long Beach and one in Los Angeles County — potentially marking the first instances of local transmission in the U.S. Unlike the 2022 clade II outbreak, which primarily affected men who have sex with men, clade I spreads through multiple contact types and is more widely prevalent in Africa. Health officials say the risk to the public remains low, as no close contacts have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, and no chain of transmission has been identified. Close contacts have been vaccinated, and investigations are ongoing. The situation is concerning due to the potential for community spread, especially amid a federal government shutdown and reduced CDC staffing, which may impair public health response. Experts highlight that while the virus is rare, its spread in new regions raises broader public health concerns.",
