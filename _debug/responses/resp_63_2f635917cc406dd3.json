  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a legal defense against federal charges of false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unlawful, circumventing Senate confirmation requirements. His legal team claims Trump’s public attacks on Comey and the selective targeting of Comey, not other top Trump administration officials, demonstrate retaliation for protected speech. The defense also references the prior dismissal of Trump’s own indictment in Florida over a similar unlawful appointment, suggesting that the current case may be subject to similar constitutional challenges. The case raises significant questions about executive overreach, the integrity of the appointment process, and the balance between government accountability and political retaliation.",
