  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Republican Party, led by President Donald Trump and allies, has launched a highly exaggerated and factually baseless campaign alleging that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorist sympathizers, and violent extremists. Despite judicial rulings and public data showing that left-wing violence is minimal compared to historical right-wing violence, and despite peaceful scenes from past rallies—including counter-protesters and a deadly incident involving a peacekeeper—the GOP continues to promote a narrative of widespread political violence. This rhetoric, which mirrors past attacks on Trump supporters as 'deplorables,' is strategically suspect and may serve to justify increased militarization and government surveillance. Democratic leaders and public opinion polls show that the narrative is not only unconvincing but also widely rejected by the American public, highlighting a growing tension between political rhetoric and factual reality.",
