Although health officials state that the risk to the public remains low and no evidence of community spread has been found, officials are monitoring the situation closely. These cases differ from prior U.S. cases, which were among international travelers. Both patients are hospitalized and recovering at home. Local health departments have vaccinated some close contacts, and investigations are ongoing. The broader context includes the global spread of clade I in Africa, the prior 2022 clade II outbreak, and the reduced capacity of public health agencies due to a federal government shutdown and CDC staffing cuts, which may impair response efforts.",
