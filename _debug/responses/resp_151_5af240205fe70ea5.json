  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of drone attacks targeted Khartoum international airport on the day before its long-anticipated reopening, with reports indicating over eight blasts and the use of suicide drones by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The attacks occurred despite the Sudanese army’s recapture of Khartoum in early 2025 and the beginning of a reconstruction and government return to the capital. The airport has been closed since April 2023 due to damage from conflict between the army and RSF. The RSF continues to conduct drone attacks on military and civilian infrastructure, with Omdurman also targeted. The situation reflects broader instability in Sudan, where the war has caused tens of thousands of deaths, displaced over 12 million people, and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. The RSF’s control over el-Fasher in Darfur threatens further ethnic violence, with the United Nations warning of possible atrocities. The attacks underscore the fragility of Sudan’s recovery and the ongoing threat to civilian infrastructure and stability.",
