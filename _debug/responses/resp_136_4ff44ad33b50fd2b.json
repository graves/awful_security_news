  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American boy, has been detained in Israeli prisons since February 2025 after a military raid on his family’s home in the West Bank. He has described severe mistreatment, including cold cells, minimal and nutritionally inadequate meals, denial of heating or cooling, and physical abuse during transport. Despite being a US citizen, he remains in detention, with human rights groups and US lawmakers, including Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley and Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), urging the Trump administration to use diplomatic pressure to secure his release. The case has become a symbol of the broader systemic mistreatment of children in Israeli military courts, where Palestinians are routinely denied fair trials. This is compounded by reports of deaths among Palestinian detainees since October 2023 and the recent Gaza ceasefire, which intensified global calls for his release. The article underscores a critical global human rights issue: the treatment of minors in Israeli detention, even when they are citizens of a foreign country.",
