  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, through its space agency SUPARCO. This marks a major advancement in the nation’s space capabilities, enabling advanced Earth observation for agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and urban planning. The satellite, which can detect subtle chemical changes on the ground, is expected to enhance national resilience and contribute to development projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). While H1 will take about two months to calibrate before full operations, it is part of a broader trend of Pakistan’s space program growth, with two other satellites (EO-1 and KS-1) already operational.
