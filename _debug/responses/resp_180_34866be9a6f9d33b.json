  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Eileen Collins, the first woman to pilot and command a NASA spacecraft, made history in the 1990s and early 2000s, overcoming gender barriers and leading high-risk space missions. Despite the tragedies of the Challenger and Columbia disasters, she remained committed to spaceflight, piloting a mission in 2005 that involved a daring 360-degree flip to inspect for damage after a foam breakaway. The article highlights her leadership, resilience, and personal journey as a mother and astronaut, and underscores the importance of her legacy in advancing women's roles in space exploration. A documentary titled 'Spacewoman' is now being released to educate and inspire the public about her trailblazing career.",
