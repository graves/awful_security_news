  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration continues to apply intense pressure on Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, signaling the potential use of military force and escalating economic sanctions and counter-drug operations. Following initial recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido in 2019, diplomatic ties were severed, and the administration has since increased a bounty on Maduro to $50 million, conducted military strikes on drug-related vessels, and authorized CIA operations in Venezuela to disrupt drug trafficking—actions that some officials acknowledge could also serve as a means to remove Maduro from power. Despite no explicit declaration of regime overthrow, the strategy reflects a persistent and evolving effort to challenge Maduro’s legitimacy and leadership through a combination of military, economic, and political tools.",
