The brothers, who have served life without parole for nearly 30 years, are now eligible for life with the possibility of parole under California law due to their age at the time of the crime and demonstrated rehabilitation. The decision follows a 2023 habeas corpus petition that presented new evidence, including a sworn statement from Roy Rosselló alleging sexual abuse by Jose Menendez and a letter from Erik Menendez referencing abuse. Public figures such as Kim Kardashian and family members have praised the move as a necessary step toward justice. The case has gained renewed attention due to the Netflix series and documentary, which have highlighted the brothers' claims of abuse and their post-prison contributions. A hearing is expected within 30 to 45 days, with the final decision resting with a Los Angeles Superior Court judge.",
