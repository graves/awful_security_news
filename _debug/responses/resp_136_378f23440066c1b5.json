  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Milwaukee Brewers, who had a strong regular season with a 97-65 record and a dominant head-to-head record against the Los Angeles Dodgers, were swept in the National League Championship Series. Despite their regular-season success, they struggled in the playoffs, scoring only four runs and 14 hits over four games, largely due to poor offensive output and team fatigue. The Dodgers, led by Shohei Ohtani's historic two-way performance — including three home runs and 10 strikeouts — overpowered the Brewers in Game 4, securing their spot in the World Series. The article highlights a significant disparity between the teams, not just in payroll ($124.8M vs. $509.5M) but in actual on-field performance, suggesting that elite individual talent and financial investment play pivotal roles in postseason outcomes, even when regular season records appear balanced.",
