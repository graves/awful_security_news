  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals, which Beijing justified as a national security measure in retaliation for U.S. trade restrictions and targeting of Chinese industries. This escalation follows a long history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, including Trump’s earlier 25% and 20% tariffs, Biden’s semiconductor export restrictions, and U.S. actions targeting Huawei and TikTok. China accuses the U.S. of double standards and discriminatory practices, while experts argue that both nations have weaponized economic interdependence and national security rhetoric. The situation is further complicated by the upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea, which may be overshadowed by mutual threats of escalation. Analysts suggest that while China appears more organized and strategic, the U.S. holds greater economic and geopolitical leverage, and the outcome hinges less on diplomacy and more on how global markets and economies react to continued pressure.",
