  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to have withstood its first major test after Israeli military strikes in Gaza following the killing of two Israeli soldiers. Both sides accuse each other of ceasefire violations: Israel claims Hamas attacked beyond the Yellow Line in Rafah, while Hamas denies involvement and accuses Israel of failing to return all bodies of the dead and conducting attacks on civilians. Despite these tensions, Hamas and the IDF have affirmed their commitment to the agreement. The US, through officials like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, continues to mediate, and aid deliveries have been resumed, though the Rafah Crossing remains closed. The situation remains fragile, with internal Hamas security operations and Israeli countermeasures escalating tensions, and political figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir criticizing the government's actions as a 'backdown'.",
