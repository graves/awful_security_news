  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a massive general strike and protest movement in Gabes, Tunisia, have shut down key urban functions, driven by public anger over decades of environmental pollution from the state-run CGT phosphate plant. Residents and the powerful UGTT labor union blame the plant—operating since 1972—for widespread health issues, including cancer and respiratory illness, and ecological collapse. Despite a 2017 promise to phase it out, the government has instead increased production, labeling phosphate a key economic pillar. Over 200 people have been hospitalized for gas exposure, and activists claim the environment and food have been poisoned. President Kais Saied has described the crisis as an 'environmental assassination' and faces growing political pressure as the protests represent a significant test of his authority and governance.",
