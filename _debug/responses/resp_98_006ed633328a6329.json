  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop India’s imports of Russian oil, framing it as a significant step in aligning with US sanctions. However, India has firmly denied any such agreement, stating it has no knowledge of a conversation between Trump and Modi, and emphasizing that it continues to import Russian oil as part of its energy security strategy. India is a major buyer of Russian oil, with state-owned refiners like Indian Oil Corporation increasing purchases over time, making a sudden halt impractical due to volume, quality, and refinery compatibility issues. This dispute reflects broader tensions between the US and India over trade and energy policy, with India asserting its sovereignty and economic independence. Despite US-imposed tariffs and diplomatic friction, both countries are engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve trade disagreements, though no resolution has been reached.",
