  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans' access to long-term one-on-one mental health therapy through the VA is being significantly curtailed under a new policy introduced after Doug Collins became VA secretary in January 2025. Multiple VA mental health providers and veterans report that therapy sessions are being abruptly ended after a set number (often 8–15), even for chronic conditions like PTSD, despite clinical need. Providers say this undermines trust, creates re-traumatization, and violates principles of shared decision-making. Some have faced disciplinary actions for challenging the policy, and staff shortages have increased due to burnout and resignations. While the VA claims there are no limits on care and that follow-up care is collaboratively planned, veterans and providers argue that the policy is not clinically appropriate and may worsen long-term outcomes. Experts like the American Psychological Association are investigating the issue, and veterans express deep concern that they are being abandoned while still in active recovery.",
