  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan has withdrawn from an upcoming tri-nation T20 cricket series following the tragic killing of three local cricketers—Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah, and Haroon—in an air strike it blames on Pakistan. The strike occurred in the Urgon district of Paktika province, where the players were dining after a match, and resulted in eight fatalities. The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) expressed deep sorrow, calling the deaths a great loss to Afghan sports. The International Cricket Council (ICC) condemned the attack and stood in solidarity with Afghanistan, while Pakistan denied targeting civilians, claiming the strike killed at least 70 militants and accusing the ICC of bias and lack of verification. The incident happened during a fragile 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which has now been extended to allow peace talks in Doha, where an Afghan delegation is participating despite accusing Pakistan of aggression. Former President Hamid Karzai called for a reevaluation of Pakistan’s policies, and Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif will lead the delegation. Zimbabwe has been confirmed as the replacement for Afghanistan in the series, illustrating both the human and sporting fallout of the conflict.",
