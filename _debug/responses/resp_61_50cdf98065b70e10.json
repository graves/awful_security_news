Keon King, a 21-year-old from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and causing a catastrophe. His cellphone activity and a stolen black Hyundai Accent—seen parked near the scene and later on fire—link him to Scott’s disappearance. Prosecutors believe other individuals may have been involved and are continuing to investigate. Though the initial charges were filed, District Attorney Larry Krasner stated homicide charges are under consideration, with an emphasis on legal process and constitutional protections. Scott’s parents expressed deep sorrow, remembering her as a source of light and kindness.",
