    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to extreme cold, has confirmed its first wild mosquitoes — three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species, found in Kiðafell, Kjós.",
    "The discovery was made by Björn Hjaltason in October 2025, who noticed a strange fly at dusk and collected it, leading to further identification by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson.",
    "The Culiseta annulata species is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates, allowing it to survive harsh winters in sheltered environments.",
    "This is the first confirmed occurrence of mosquitoes in Iceland’s natural environment; a single mosquito from a different species was previously found on an airplane at Keflavík International Airport, but not in the wild.",
    "Theories suggest the mosquitoes may have arrived via ships or containers, though their ability to survive and establish in Iceland remains uncertain and will be monitored in the spring.",
    "While climate change may have contributed to the warming conditions that allow mosquitoes to survive, experts remain cautious about directly linking the discovery to climate change, noting that mosquitoes are already found in other northern regions.",
    "As global temperatures rise, mosquitoes are expanding their range and lifespan, making such discoveries significant for public health and climate science."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long protected from mosquitoes due to its extreme cold, has confirmed its first wild sighting of the Culiseta annulata mosquito species in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík. The discovery, initially reported by resident Björn Hjaltason and verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marks a significant ecological shift. While climate change may have contributed to warming conditions enabling such insects to survive, experts remain cautious, noting that mosquitoes are already found in other northern regions and that the species’ cold adaptation allows it to endure harsh winters. The finding raises broader questions about climate change’s impact on biodiversity and the potential for disease-carrying insects to expand into previously inhospitable areas.",
