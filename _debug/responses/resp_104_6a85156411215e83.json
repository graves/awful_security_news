  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the theory of 'enshittification,' a term coined by internet activist and journalist Cory Doctorow, describing how major internet platforms such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade from user-friendly services into exploitative, profit-driven systems. Doctorow outlines a three-stage process: in Stage 1, platforms attract users with strong value and transparency; in Stage 2, they prioritize business customers, enabling data exploitation and ad targeting; and in Stage 3, they extract maximum profit through predatory pricing, algorithmic manipulation, and excessive fees. The theory is rooted in the lack of competition and weak regulation, allowing platforms to build insurmountable user lock-ins via network effects and high switching costs. Doctorow proposes solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, abolishing the consumer welfare standard, implementing 'right-to-exit' policies, and promoting interoperability between services. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, the article highlights a growing public and policy movement to reverse the enshittification of the internet.",
