  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Grammy-winning songwriter, Brett James, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, in Franklin, North Carolina, along with two others. According to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the plane, a Cirrus SR22T, entered a 'tightening spiral' after James failed to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency, resulting in lost communication with air traffic control. Despite being cleared for a visual approach to runway 7, James did not adjust his radio frequency and announced a 360-degree turn, which led to the aircraft flying over the runway and descending into a left turn before crashing. No mechanical issues were found in the wreckage, suggesting the incident stemmed from a communication or procedural error. Brett James was a prominent figure in the music industry, known for collaborations with Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney, including the hit 'Jesus, Take the Wheel' and 'Out Last Night'.",
