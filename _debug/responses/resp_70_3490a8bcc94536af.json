  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, centering on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistan citizen indicted in 2023 for marijuana and cocaine use and firearm possession. The case hinges on whether the law violates the Second Amendment, with the Trump administration arguing that habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, especially when impaired. A lower court previously dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court decision requiring gun prohibitions to have historical roots, and the 5th Circuit upheld that precedent. The Trump administration appealed, citing Hemani’s alleged ties to Iran and fraud-related activities, though Hemani’s legal team challenges the historical basis of the law, noting that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized marijuana. The case is further complicated by Hunter Biden’s prior conviction under the same law and subsequent pardon, adding political salience. The Supreme Court will likely hear arguments in early 2026 and issue a decision by the end of June 2026, potentially setting a major precedent on gun rights and drug use in the United States.",
