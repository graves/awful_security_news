  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government remains in a full shutdown as of October 2025, following the failure to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This marks a significant escalation compared to the 2018 shutdown, which lasted 35 days and was the longest in nearly 50 years, resulting in a $3 billion GDP loss and affecting approximately 800,000 federal employees. The current situation is exacerbated by political polarization, a narrow House majority led by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the lack of 60 Senate votes to break a filibuster. The article highlights how past and present shutdowns reflect deeper legislative gridlock, with the 2018 shutdown serving as a key historical benchmark due to its duration and economic impact.",
