  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York state prison guard, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter in the death of inmate Robert Brooks, who was beaten multiple times upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2025. The incident, captured on silent body-camera footage, showed guards punching, stomping, and lifting Brooks by the neck, with prosecutors alleging a gang-like assault that demonstrated 'depraved indifference to human life.' While Kingsley was convicted, guards Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer were acquitted of murder charges, though they faced lesser charges of gang assault. The case drew national attention due to the graphic nature of the video and the systemic issues it exposed. Special prosecutor William Fitzpatrick led the investigation after Attorney General Letitia James recused herself due to conflicts of interest. The case is part of a broader pattern of violence in state prisons, with similar legal actions underway in the fatal beating of Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility in March 2025.",
