    "The White House East Wing is undergoing massive demolition and reconstruction as part of Donald Trump’s plan to build a new $250 million ballroom.",
    "The project is the first major structural change to the White House since 1948 and the first under President Trump.",
    "The new ballroom is estimated to cover 90,000 square feet (8,360 m²) and could seat up to 999 people, significantly expanding capacity compared to the current East Room (which seats ~200).",
    "Construction began on Monday, October 21, 2025, despite lack of formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which is currently closed due to a federal government shutdown.",
    "Trump claims the project is privately funded by himself and private donors, with no cost to taxpayers — though no specific donors have been named.",
    "The East Wing, built in 1902, has historically housed the first lady’s offices and foreign dignitary entrances, and now will be redeveloped for the ballroom.",
    "The new structure will be built adjacent to, not directly touching, the main White House building, preserving its integrity as per Trump’s claim.",
    "The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction (Virginia) and engineering by AECOM (Dallas).",
    "The White House has undergone structural changes since 1800, with notable modifications throughout history, including after a fire in 1814.",
    "The project has sparked public and political debate over federal spending, transparency, and the appropriate use of taxpayer-funded space."
