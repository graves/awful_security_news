  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During his second term, President Donald Trump has applied his long-standing branding strategies from the Trump Organization to the federal government, launching a series of branded initiatives such as TrumpRx, the Trump Gold Card, a proposed Trump coin, and a new fighter jet named F-47. These efforts, rooted in the popular 'MAGA' slogan, reflect a business-like approach to governance, emphasizing simplicity, memorability, and personal visibility. While praised for agility and modernity in communication—especially on social media—the practices have drawn criticism for violating longstanding norms of government neutrality and promoting political self-interest. The article highlights concerns that these branding tactics commodify public institutions, blur the line between state and personal promotion, and risk undermining democratic norms. Despite legal and constitutional hurdles—such as the prohibition against depicting a sitting president on currency—the initiatives have been widely promoted, with global leaders adopting the Trump branding model. This marks a shift in political governance, where leadership identity is now central to policy execution and public engagement.",
