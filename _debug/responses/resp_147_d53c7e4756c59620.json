    "China has tightened export controls on 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, bringing the total to 12 restricted metals from the 17 known rare-earth elements.",
    "The new restrictions include export controls on specialized technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals and disclose the intended use of products containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",
    "China cited national security concerns, citing instances of foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications, which it claims threatens its security and global non-proliferation efforts.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, and sourcing 70% of its rare-earth compounds and metals from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are critical for defence technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, and AI semiconductors, making them pivotal in both military and civilian technological infrastructure.",
    "China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global supply.",
    "The controls are seen as a strategic move to strengthen China’s leverage during upcoming US–China trade negotiations, especially in the lead-up to the Trump–Xi meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea.",
    "Experts interpret the move as a form of 'pre-meeting choreography'—a signal that China is prepared to weaponize its supply-chain dominance, thereby pressuring the US in negotiations.",
    "Exemptions are granted for emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, and disaster relief, ensuring critical humanitarian use is not disrupted.",
    "The US-China economic relationship remains deeply intertwined, with reciprocal supply chains, meaning China’s restrictions could harm its own economy as well as that of the US."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—including five new additions—by announcing stricter restrictions on both the metals and the specialized equipment used to refine them. The controls, effective from December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain special approvals and disclose the intended use of products containing rare-earth materials, citing national security concerns. China claims that certain foreign entities have used Chinese rare-earth materials for military purposes, threatening its security and global stability. The move occurs just weeks before a high-level US–China meeting during the APEC summit in South Korea, where President Donald Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Analysts interpret this as a strategic signal to strengthen China’s leverage in negotiations, especially given the US’s heavy reliance on Chinese rare-earth supplies—70% of which come from China between 2020 and 2023. The restrictions affect critical technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missiles, semiconductors, and electric vehicles. While exemptions exist for emergency medical and disaster relief, the move underscores the deep interdependence of the US and China’s economies and the strategic importance of rare-earth metals in both military and civilian technology.",
