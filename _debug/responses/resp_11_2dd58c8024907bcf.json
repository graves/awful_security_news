  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of first-degree murder after poisoning his wife Angela Craig with arsenic, tetrahydrozoline from eyedrops, and potassium cyanide. The plan unfolded over several weeks in early 2023, beginning with online searches for poison dosages and purchases of toxic substances, including arsenic and oleandrin. Craig used his dental office as a cover to order and store these poisons. Angela’s symptoms began after consuming protein shakes laced with the toxins, leading to multiple hospitalizations and eventually her death on March 18, 2023. Key figures such as office manager Caitlin Romero and business partner Dr. Ryan Redfearn discovered the suspicious activity and raised alarms, potentially preventing the murder. The case highlights the dangers of online research into poisons and the importance of medical vigilance in detecting domestic violence and poisoning patterns.",
