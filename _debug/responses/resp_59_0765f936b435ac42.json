The Trump administration appealed, arguing that habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, especially during police encounters while impaired, and cited allegations involving Iran and fraud. Hemani’s legal team challenged the historical basis of the law and highlighted the widespread legalization of marijuana in U.S. states.
