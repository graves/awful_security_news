  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a high-profile Gaza ceasefire deal attributed to Donald Trump, American public opinion shows little enthusiasm. Polls from AP-NORC and CNBC indicate that while Trump’s approval on Gaza slightly increased, disapproval remains high and overall approval is at a low point in his second term. The article emphasizes that economic concerns — particularly inflation, rising prices, and job insecurity — dominate public sentiment, with only 32% expecting economic improvement in the next year. Americans place far greater importance on domestic issues than foreign policy, and a CBS News-YouGov poll shows that just 4% consider international events the most important issue facing the country. This suggests that even a major international diplomatic win fails to translate into public support, reinforcing the idea that 'it’s the economy, stupid' remains a key political truth in the U.S.",
