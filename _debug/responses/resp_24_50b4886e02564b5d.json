  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy related to a 2007 campaign finance scheme involving Libyan funds exchanged for diplomatic favors. This marks the first time a former leader of modern France has served time in prison. Sarkozy, who left office in 2012, has appealed his conviction and is currently housed in the VIP wing of La Santé Prison in Paris—a secure facility previously used to house high-profile figures such as Manuel Noriega and Jacques Mesrine. While he maintains his innocence and expresses sorrow over what he views as political vendetta, his legal team is seeking early release. The case has significant implications for accountability in political financing and public trust in French judicial processes.",
