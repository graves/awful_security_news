  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, has stepped away from the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent, citing deep-seated disunity, lack of loyalty, and failure to protect marginalized communities—including Black women—as key reasons for her decision. She recounts her observations during the 2024 presidential debate, where she noted President Biden’s hoarseness and public scrutiny, which she sees as symptomatic of broader political vulnerability. Jean-Pierre attributes the Democratic Party’s loss in the 2024 election to internal fractures, exemplified by public figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney expressing doubt about Biden’s fitness. She also reflects on the systemic bias she faced as a Black woman in a leadership role and the party’s failure to center Black women’s voices. Ultimately, her decision to become independent is not a betrayal but a call for accountability, urging Americans to reimagine politics beyond party lines and to reject silence in the face of injustice.",
