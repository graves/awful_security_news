  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a developing ceasefire scenario following two years of war between Israel and Hamas, Hamas has handed over the remains of 12 of 28 deceased hostages taken during the October 7, 2023, attack. Israel has confirmed the return of two coffins and is demanding faster delivery of the rest, while maintaining control of the Rafah crossing, which remains closed since May 2024. The Palestinian Health Ministry reports over 68,000 civilian deaths, with thousands still unaccounted for. Hamas claims delays are due to unexploded ordnance and military control, while Israel disputes the death toll and accuses Hamas of stealing aid. The U.S. has warned that a planned Hamas attack on civilians would violate the ceasefire and could lead to military action. Families are demanding the return of all missing hostages, and public rallies continue in Israel. Aid deliveries to Gaza remain critically low, with only 339 trucks offloaded since the ceasefire began, far below the 600-per-day target. Both sides continue to accuse each other of violations, with Israel claiming military actions are in self-defense and Hamas citing civilian deaths in cross-border incidents.",
