  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is conducting a judicial review of federal law enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE deployment in Chicago that led to over 1,000 arrests. She expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras on federal agents on the ground, particularly in protest situations, raising concerns about transparency and the use of force. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras, ICE Special Response Teams lack them and must go through Congress for approval. Testimonies revealed that ICE agents are trained in protest response and media handling, but incidents such as one where Pastor David Black was struck with pepper balls without warning have sparked public and legal concern. The federal leadership has been described as unstable, with frequent shifts in high-level officers, and the judge plans to continue questioning key officials like Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino to assess on-the-ground conduct and policy compliance.",
