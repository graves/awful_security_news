  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Roman Surovtsev, a former refugee from the former Soviet Union, was detained by ICE in August 2025 during a routine check-in, despite having no criminal record since a teenage carjacking conviction in 2014. After losing his green card and being declared stateless due to lack of citizenship documentation from Ukraine and Russia, ICE attempted to deport him to Ukraine—a country that has not provided travel documents and is currently at war with Russia. His wife, Samantha, successfully obtained legal representation and vacated his carjacking conviction on grounds of inadequate legal notification, restoring his eligibility for a green card. Despite this, ICE continues to detain him, arguing that travel documents are still being sought. This case highlights serious due process violations, the human cost of mass deportation policies, and the systemic failure to recognize stateless individuals as having valid legal protections. The article underscores that such actions are not only legally flawed but morally indefensible, especially when deportation would result in death or exposure to armed conflict.",
