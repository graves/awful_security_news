  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the government shutdown in October 2025, the Trump administration announced it would use tariff revenue—specifically from Section 32 and Section 232 tariffs—to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million vulnerable individuals. The move was prompted by Congress’s failure to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill, which caused WIC to face a critical funding lapse. While the White House claimed this was a 'creative solution' to prevent program collapse, legal experts and advocacy groups raised concerns about the legality and transparency of redirecting tariff funds without congressional appropriation. Despite bipartisan support for WIC, the plan has significant limitations in terms of long-term sustainability, funding clarity, and timely disbursement. The incident underscores growing political and financial tensions over federal funding, especially for social safety net programs amid economic and political gridlock.",
