  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Israeli military confirmed that two coffins containing the apparent remains of deceased Israeli hostages were transferred into Israel from Gaza by Hamas, escorted by IDF troops. The bodies were delivered to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine for identification and investigation, marking the 14th and 15th confirmed deceased hostages returned since the US-proposed ceasefire deal was signed on October 9. While Hamas claimed the transfer was scheduled and required special equipment for recovery, Israeli officials expressed concern that Hamas may not be able to locate and return all remaining dead hostages due to rubble and logistical challenges. One of the earlier bodies was reportedly misidentified, indicating possible operational issues. US Vice President JD Vance emphasized the difficulty of the recovery process, stating that it will not happen overnight and that some bodies may be buried under rubble. This development follows a broader ceasefire agreement that required Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours, but the slow progress reflects ongoing tensions, accusations of violations, and the immense challenges of recovery in war-torn Gaza.",
