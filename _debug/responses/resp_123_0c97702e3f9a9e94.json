  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that introducing peanuts to infants as early as four months reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies by over 80%, new research shows a significant decline in peanut allergy rates in the U.S. — with a 27% drop after 2015 and over 40% after 2017 — resulting in approximately 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies. This shift is attributed to updated medical guidelines, which now recommend introducing allergenic foods like peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based products between 4 and 6 months of age without prior screening. Despite initial slow adoption due to confusion among healthcare providers, real-world data from pediatric practices now show that early allergen exposure is being adopted and has made a measurable public health impact. Experts, advocacy groups, and clinicians agree that this evidence-based approach represents a meaningful opportunity to reduce the prevalence of food allergies nationwide.",
