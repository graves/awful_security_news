    "Iceland, long believed to be mosquito-free due to its cold climate, has confirmed the first wild mosquito sighting in the species Culiseta annulata, discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík.",
    "This discovery marks the first known instance of mosquitoes occurring naturally in Iceland, contrasting with a previous isolated finding of a single mosquito on an airplane at Keflavík International Airport.",
    "The Culiseta annulata species is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and is adapted to cold climates, allowing adults to survive freezing winter temperatures in sheltered environments.",
    "Theories suggest the mosquito may have arrived via ships or shipping containers, though the exact origin remains unclear.",
    "Climate change may be contributing to the spread of mosquitoes into new regions, including Iceland, by increasing temperatures and allowing insects to survive longer and grow faster, although experts remain uncertain about a direct causal link.",
    "Iceland has already experienced record-breaking heat, with May 2025 temperatures more than 18°F above normal, which is linked to climate change.",
    "Scientists emphasize the need for further monitoring in the spring to determine whether the species can survive the winter and become established in the country.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson caution that while warming temperatures may increase the likelihood of mosquito establishment, it is not yet clear whether climate change directly caused this discovery, due to limited data on northern mosquito range shifts."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland has confirmed its first wild mosquito sighting in the species Culiseta annulata, discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, in late October 2025. This marks a significant shift, as mosquitoes were previously absent from Iceland due to extreme cold. The species, native to cold regions of the Eastern Hemisphere, is adapted to survive harsh winters. While climate change may contribute to mosquito range expansion, experts remain cautious about direct causation, noting that previous mosquito sightings in Scandinavia and rising global temperatures may have created a more favorable environment. Ongoing monitoring in spring 2026 will determine whether the species can survive and establish a permanent population. The discovery highlights broader trends in climate-driven ecological changes, with mosquitoes potentially expanding into new regions as global temperatures rise.",
