  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia’s appeals court has overturned former President Alvaro Uribe’s 2024 conviction for fraud and bribery, citing structural flaws and insufficient evidence in the original ruling. The decision, which follows years of legal and political contention, has reignited debates about how Colombia’s judiciary handles past paramilitary ties and political violence. Uribe, a polarizing figure known for his military campaigns against left-wing rebels, had been accused of orchestrating witness tampering with paramilitary members. Critics, including current President Gustavo Petro, argue the ruling enables the historical cover-up of right-wing abuses. The decision has prompted Senator Ivan Cepeda to appeal to the Supreme Court and is expected to significantly influence the 2026 presidential election. The case has also attracted international attention, particularly from U.S. political figures like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, who have criticized judicial bias toward conservative leaders. With further appeals likely and political consequences looming, the case remains a critical flashpoint in Colombia’s political and judicial future.",
