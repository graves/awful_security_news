  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel, and Adam Mosseri are ordered to testify in a landmark trial over social media's impact on young people's mental health, following a decision by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl that rejected Meta and Snap's arguments that in-person testimony was unnecessary. The case, which consolidated hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, alleges that companies designed addictive features such as 'likes' and failed to improve parental controls despite knowing of mental health risks. While the companies claim protection under the 1990s Communications Decency Act, the judge ruled that negligence in app design—such as failure to adjust content or implement safeguards—remains legally actionable. The trial, expected in January 2025, marks one of the first major legal actions to hold social media executives accountable for the psychological harm their platforms may cause. This case is part of a broader legal and political push to address youth mental health concerns tied to social media use, with companies like TikTok and YouTube also named in the suit.",
