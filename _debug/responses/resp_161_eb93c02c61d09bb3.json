The project, estimated at $250 million and funded privately by Trump and private donors, is the first major structural change to the White House since 1948 and the first under Trump. Despite the National Capital Planning Commission being closed due to a government shutdown, construction has proceeded without formal approval. The East Wing, which has housed the first lady’s offices since 1977 and includes a visitor entrance and underground bunker, is being demolished and reconstructed. The new ballroom aims to address longstanding demands for a space to host state dinners and international guests, with construction expected to be completed before Trump’s term ends in January 2029. The project has drawn significant public and media attention due to its scale, historical significance, and potential impact on the White House’s legacy and security.",
