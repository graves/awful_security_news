  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective U.S. weapon used in conflicts across the Middle East and the Balkans, is being considered by Ukraine as a way to strike deep into Russian territory—targeting facilities like the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov. President Volodymyr Zelensky has advocated for its supply, arguing it would pressure Russia and strengthen Ukraine’s position in negotiations. However, the U.S. Trump administration has withheld delivery, citing domestic needs and the risk of escalation, with Russia warning that such supply would be a 'hostile move' due to the missile’s potential nuclear capability. Ukraine lacks the required ground-launch platform (Typhon) and its own cruise missile (Flamingo) remains underdeveloped. While Tomahawks offer significant destructive power, Ukraine’s immediate military needs center on enhancing air defenses against Russian missile and drone attacks. Zelensky’s ongoing negotiations with U.S. defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon reflect broader efforts to secure advanced military capabilities.",
