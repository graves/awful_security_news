    "A man named Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old pensioner and amateur poet, was found guilty of terrorism and sentenced to 21 years in prison for shooting Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "The attack occurred during a public visit to Handlova, about 180km (112 miles) from Bratislava, when Cintula mistakenly believed Fico was a supporter and fired at him at close range.",
    "Cintula claimed he only intended to injure Fico, not kill him, and stated he had aimed away from vital organs, but the court found he specifically targeted the prime minister, qualifying as a terrorism offense.",
    "The attack led to Fico being seriously injured in the abdomen and required emergency helicopter transport to a hospital, with his condition described as life-threatening.",
    "The court rejected Cintula’s attempt to reduce the charge to attacking a public official, affirming the terrorism classification due to the targeted nature of the attack on a national leader.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In May 2024, Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old pensioner and amateur poet, shot Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico during a public visit to Handlova, 180km from Bratislava, mistaking him for a supporter. The attack, which occurred at extremely close range, seriously injured Fico in the abdomen, leading to emergency medical treatment. Cintula was found guilty of terrorism, not merely attacking a public official, with Judge Igor Kralik stating that the attack was specifically directed at the prime minister. The defense attempted to reduce the charge, but the court rejected this, affirming the terrorism designation. Cintula's lawyer plans to appeal, and the incident has intensified political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming opposition parties for inciting hatred despite his own controversial rhetoric.",
