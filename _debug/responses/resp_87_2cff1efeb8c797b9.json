Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the operation as necessary due to the threat posed by cartels likened to Al Qaeda, citing a classified legal opinion that allows for the designation of drug traffickers as enemy combatants and summary execution. This approach has drawn strong criticism from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US of killing an innocent national and denounced US involvement in drug trade. The Trump administration has also canceled financial aid to Colombia and authorized CIA operations in Venezuela as part of a broader pressure campaign. Legislative bodies, including Senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, have voiced concern over the erosion of due process and the expansion of presidential war powers, highlighting a growing debate over the legality and morality of lethal military strikes against drug suspects.",
