  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York state prison guard, Robert Brooks, died after being violently beaten three times upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024, with the final beating captured on silent body-camera footage. A jury found David Kingsley guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter, while Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer were acquitted of murder charges. The prosecution argued that all guards acted as a gang with depraved indifference to human life, and the video evidence showed officers punching, stomping, and lifting Brooks by the neck. The case was prosecuted by William Fitzpatrick, who took over after Attorney General Letitia James recused herself due to civil litigation involving prison guards. This incident is part of a broader pattern of misconduct, including the March 2025 beating and death of inmate Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility. Multiple guards have pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and several are cooperating with prosecutors, highlighting systemic failures in prison oversight and accountability.",
