  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a swift summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been effectively abandoned, with the White House now stating there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. This comes after an initial promise made following a phone call, where Trump indicated a meeting would occur within two weeks. However, diplomatic efforts between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have also stalled, as officials believe Lavrov lacks real policy influence and that the Russian position on ending the war has not evolved sufficiently. The Kremlin maintains that no summit has been scheduled and thus cannot be postponed. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that Russia’s reduced diplomatic interest stems from the US refusal to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles, suggesting that military capability is key to peace. Trump remains committed to achieving a diplomatic resolution, and future diplomatic engagements may take place at international forums like the ASEAN summit in Malaysia. The broader context highlights a diplomatic impasse in Ukraine, with the US and Russia failing to move beyond maximalist stances, and the pivotal role of military capacity in shaping future negotiations.",
