    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, bringing the total to 12 restricted metals out of the 17 known rare-earth elements.",
    "The restrictions extend to specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, and foreign companies must obtain special approvals from Beijing for exports of rare-earth magnets and semiconductor materials with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth content.",
    "China cites national security and the threat of unauthorized military use of rare-earth materials as justification for the controls, noting that certain foreign entities have transferred or processed Chinese rare-earth materials for sensitive applications.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, AI semiconductors, F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missiles, radar systems, and medical imaging equipment.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth metals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth of such goods in 2023, and sourced 70% of its rare-earth imports from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "This move is seen as a strategic signal of China's leverage ahead of a high-level US-China meeting during the APEC summit in South Korea, with analysts interpreting it as 'pre-meeting choreography' to strengthen China’s negotiating position.",
    "The restrictions may deepen the US defence and industrial vulnerabilities, especially given the US's limited domestic production capacity for rare-earth materials.",
    "China has maintained that exports related to emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief will remain exempt from restrictions.",
    "The US previously restricted China’s access to semiconductors, indicating a reciprocal dynamic in the broader tech and supply chain rivalry between the two nations."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—adding five new metals to earlier restrictions—and on specialized equipment used to refine them, effective December 1, 2025. The restrictions are justified on grounds of national security, citing unauthorized military use of Chinese rare-earth materials. The move comes just weeks before a high-level meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, signaling a strategic effort by China to strengthen its leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. As the U.S. is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products and relies on them for critical defence systems like fighter jets, submarines, and AI semiconductors, the restrictions threaten to deepen existing vulnerabilities in American industrial and military capabilities. Analysts view this as a deliberate 'pre-meeting choreography' designed to pressure the U.S. during diplomatic talks, emphasizing the deep interdependence of the two economies and the pivotal role of rare-earth metals in modern technology and global security.",
