  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, with Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth minerals. The dispute stems from mutual accusations of trade bullying and national security overreach, with China asserting its actions are justified under national security concerns and the US claiming leverage through targeted tariffs and export controls. Historical context includes past tariff escalations, such as Trump’s 25% tariffs in 2018 and Biden’s semiconductor restrictions, which have evolved into a technology-led conflict. Experts argue that both nations are using economic tools strategically, with China appearing more organized and the US showing policy inconsistency. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea in October 2025 is seen as a critical diplomatic moment, with market reactions and economic vulnerability determining the outcome. The article underscores how the US-China trade conflict has transitioned from goods-based tariffs to high-stakes technological and strategic competition, impacting global supply chains and economic stability.",
