  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 NBA season begins with a record number of international players — 135 born outside the U.S., from 43 countries, including 71 from Europe — marking a significant shift in the league's global reach. The article highlights that all 30 teams have at least one international player, with Canada leading in non-U.S. representation. The NBA and FIBA are in talks about launching a new league in Europe, potentially by 2027, reflecting a broader effort to expand basketball globally. This trend is reinforced by the fact that the last seven NBA MVPs have gone to players born outside the U.S. Notable players include Nikola Jokic (Serbia), Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece), Joel Embiid (Cameroon-born), and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Canada). Meanwhile, individual milestones are tracked for LeBron James, whose 23rd season and record-breaking stats underscore the cultural and historical significance of his career. The article also notes the rarity of the Brooklyn Nets, with no players in the top 100 scorers, and highlights naming trends such as seven players named Jordan, five named Nikola, and five named James. Additionally, the league is approaching the milestone of 14 million total points, expected around November 17, 2025.",
