  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a meticulously planned heist that took place just after the Louvre Museum in Paris opened on Sunday, October 19, 2025, thieves stole eight of nine items from the French Crown Jewels, including a tiara, necklace, earrings, and brooches belonging to queens Marie-Amélie, Hortense, and Eugénie. The robbers, believed to be four armed individuals, used a truck-mounted ladder and angle grinders to force open a window in the Apollo Gallery, one of the museum’s most ornate rooms. One item, Empress Eugénie’s crown, was damaged during the heist. The thieves fled on motorcycles, and police found tools such as angle grinders, a blowtorch, gasoline, gloves, a walkie-talkie, and a yellow vest used to disguise themselves. No injuries were reported, and the museum remained closed for security reasons. French officials, including Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, President Emmanuel Macron, and Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau, condemned the act as a serious attack on national heritage. An investigation into organized crime and possible foreign involvement is ongoing, with experts warning that the stolen items may be melted or recut, leading to irreversible loss of historical value.",
