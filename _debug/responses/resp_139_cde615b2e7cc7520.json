  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has agreed to cease using royal titles such as Duke of York, amid growing public and political pressure stemming from revelations of his prolonged relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Despite this, he still holds the title by inheritance from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and remains a prince by birth. The controversy intensified after Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she had a sexual relationship with Andrew when she was 17, published her memoir 'Nobody’s Girl', in which she alleges the prince viewed sex with her as a 'birthright' and attempted to have a gag order placed to suppress the allegations. Andrew previously settled a civil lawsuit with Giuffre in 2022, acknowledging her suffering as a victim of sex trafficking without admitting wrongdoing. Political figures like SNP lawmaker Stephen Flynn have urged the government to formally strip Andrew and others like Peter Mandelson of their titles, citing public outrage and the need for accountability. The Metropolitan Police is investigating whether Andrew in 2011 attempted to smear Giuffre by asking a police bodyguard to check her criminal record. Questions also remain about how Andrew funds his residence at Royal Lodge, which he rents from the Crown Estate. The monarchy faces ongoing scrutiny as public trust erodes and the king prepares for a state visit to the Vatican.",
