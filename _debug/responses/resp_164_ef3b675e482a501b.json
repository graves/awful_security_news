  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major AWS outage that began at 07:11 GMT due to a flawed technical update to DynamoDB’s API in its Virginia data center caused a cascading failure across 113 services. The root cause was a DNS failure that prevented applications from locating server addresses, disrupting high-profile platforms including Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, banks, airlines, media outlets, and smart home devices. Although AWS restored services by 10:11 GMT, users faced delays and message backlogs. Experts confirmed the failure resulted from human error, not a cyberattack. The incident underscores the critical dependence of modern digital life—spanning finance, communication, entertainment, and smart devices—on centralized cloud infrastructure, especially AWS, which dominates the global cloud market.",
