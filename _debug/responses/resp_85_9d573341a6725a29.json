  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York state prison guard, Robert Brooks, died from injuries sustained during a brutal beating at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024, captured on silent body-camera footage that revealed guards punching, stomping, and lifting him by the neck. The footage, which showed the guards acting unconcerned, became central to the prosecution's case. David Kingsley was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter, while Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer were acquitted of murder charges. Kieffer faced a false instrument charge, and both Galliher and Kieffer were acquitted of gang assault charges. Prosecutors argued that all guards acted as a gang with a depraved indifference to life, while defense attorneys claimed that individual actions did not equate to criminal guilt. The case is part of a broader pattern of violence in New York prisons, with similar charges pending in the March 2025 death of inmate Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility. William Fitzpatrick, the special prosecutor, took over the case after Attorney General Letitia James recused herself due to representing guards in civil lawsuits. Six of the 10 guards indicted in February have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty, with three more agreeing to reduced charges and cooperating with prosecutors.",
