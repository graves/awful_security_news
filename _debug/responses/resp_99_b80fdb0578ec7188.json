  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the October 2025 federal government shutdown, essential federal workers—including those at the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Internal Revenue Service—are facing unprecedented anxiety about taking time off. Employees fear being labeled with disciplinary actions in their records for furlough notices, especially for medically necessary procedures or pre-approved leave. Conflicting guidance from supervisors—such as warnings that absence equals termination or AWOL—is creating widespread stress. The Trump administration has intensified concerns by issuing reductions in force (RIF) and challenging a 2019 law that guarantees retroactive pay for furloughed workers. Experts and union leaders argue that treating furloughs as disciplinary actions is a new and unjust practice, undermining worker protections and forcing employees to choose between their health and their jobs.",
