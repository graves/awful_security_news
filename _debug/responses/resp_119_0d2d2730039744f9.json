  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, several prominent institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth—have publicly rejected the agreement. The compact requires schools to enforce gender-based restroom and sports policies, freeze tuition, limit international student enrollment, and mandate standardized testing, all in exchange for preferential federal funding. University leaders argue that such policies compromise academic integrity, scientific merit, and research funding, with many citing a fundamental conflict between political ideology and academic freedom. Despite a White House meeting with key university leaders, no agreement has been reached, and dissent continues to grow. The situation reflects a broader conflict between federal policy and institutional autonomy in higher education, raising concerns about the politicization of academic funding and research.",
