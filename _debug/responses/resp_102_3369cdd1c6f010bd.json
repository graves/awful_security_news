  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study in the journal Pediatrics shows that reversing long-standing advice against early peanut exposure has significantly reduced food allergies in U.S. children. After a landmark 2015 study (LEAP) found that early introduction of peanuts reduced allergy risk—especially in children of similar ancestry but different exposure patterns—health guidelines were updated in 2015 and 2017. These changes led to a 43% reduction in peanut allergy and a 36% drop in overall food allergy prevalence over the past decade. The study analyzed data from over 120,000 children and attributes the success to early allergen introduction, including peanuts, starting as early as 4 to 6 months in high-risk infants. Despite challenges in implementation due to parental fear and lack of real eating habit data, researchers believe the shift in guidance has prevented at least 40,000 children from developing peanut allergies. Experts note that peanut allergies are persistent, with only about 10% of affected children outgrowing them, making early prevention a crucial public health strategy.",
