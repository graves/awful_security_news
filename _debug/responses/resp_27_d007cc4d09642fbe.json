    "Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and the first to develop in the Caribbean Sea, indicating a warmer-than-usual sea surface temperature environment that is fueling storm development.",
    "The storm’s track remains uncertain, with two primary scenarios: one involving a northward turn toward Hispaniola and another involving a westward path toward Central America (Nicaragua or Honduras).",
    "The development of Melissa reflects broader climate trends, including increased frequency of extreme rapid intensification in Atlantic hurricanes, such as Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto, linked to global warming and fossil fuel pollution."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. With maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and a track that remains uncertain, the storm poses a serious threat to Hispaniola, particularly the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where torrential rainfall—potentially over a foot—could trigger flash flooding and dangerous mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico is likely to face significant rain, though not a direct hit. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, there is a small chance of impact on the East Coast, especially Florida, due to a possible northward turn. The storm’s development is linked to warmer Caribbean sea temperatures, a trend tied to climate change, and reflects a broader pattern of increased rapid intensification seen in recent hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto.",
