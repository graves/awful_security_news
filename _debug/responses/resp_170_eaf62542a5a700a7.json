  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, contrasting his success in facilitating a ceasefire in Gaza with his failure to achieve similar results in Ukraine. The Gaza breakthrough relied on Israel’s attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar, which gave Trump leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In contrast, Trump lacks the same diplomatic leverage in Ukraine due to the absence of a similar regional alignment or strong pressure points. His attempts to negotiate a deal with Vladimir Putin, including a proposed summit in Budapest, have been suspended, and his interactions with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky have been marked by tension and inconsistent support, including threats to suspend arms and intelligence sharing. The article suggests that Putin may be manipulating Trump’s desire for face-to-face diplomacy, while Trump himself has acknowledged that ending the war is far more difficult than he initially believed. Ultimately, the article highlights the complexity of conflict resolution when neither side is willing to concede, and the limits of Trump’s influence in a prolonged and deeply entrenched war.",
