  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the U.S. administration now stating there are no plans for a meeting in the immediate future. This comes after Trump initially suggested a meeting within two weeks following a phone call. However, diplomatic engagement between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has also been downgraded, with officials noting that Lavrov lacks real influence and that Russian positions remain maximalist. The Kremlin rejected proposals to freeze the war, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed the U.S. withholding long-range missile support for Russia's reduced willingness to engage in diplomacy. The White House maintains Trump remains committed to peace, and while future meetings between Rubio and Lavrov are still possible at an ASEAN summit in Malaysia, current momentum for a Trump-Putin summit has effectively ended.",
