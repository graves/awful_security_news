  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "SpaceX has settled a lawsuit filed by Cards Against Humanity over allegations that the company trespassed and damaged a plot of land in Cameron County, Texas, which Cards Against Humanity purchased in 2017 as a political stunt against President Donald Trump’s border wall initiative. The lawsuit claimed SpaceX placed construction materials and debris on the land without permission, and Cards Against Humanity alleged trespassing during a six-month period. SpaceX admitted to trespassing during the discovery phase of the case, and the two parties reached a settlement before a jury trial was scheduled for November 3, 2025. The company sought $15 million in damages, including for lost vegetation, but stated that a trial would have cost more than it would have recovered. As a result, SpaceX removed construction equipment, and Cards Against Humanity is now restoring the land to its natural state. The settlement allows the company to return funds to its 150,000 contributors, though it acknowledged that most contributors would likely receive little or no payout.",
