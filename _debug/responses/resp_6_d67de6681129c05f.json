  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration's imposition of high tariffs—50% on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia—is driving up the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to a 21% increase in retail coffee prices in August 2025. As the U.S. imports over 99% of its coffee, with Brazil supplying the largest share, these tariffs directly impact roasters like Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting, who report higher bean costs and operational challenges. Consumers in major markets like Washington, DC, are feeling the pinch, with average coffee prices rising by 3–4%. Despite the financial strain, consumers are unlikely to abandon coffee due to its status as an affordable luxury. In response, a bipartisan group of representatives, including Don Bacon and Ro Khanna, introduced the 'No Coffee Tax Act' to exempt coffee from tariffs, signaling political recognition of the economic harm. The situation underscores the vulnerability of small and medium-sized coffee businesses to trade policy changes and supply disruptions.",
