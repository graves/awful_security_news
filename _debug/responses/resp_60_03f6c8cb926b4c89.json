  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on October 20, 2025, lasting several hours, which disrupted major online services such as banking, social media, shopping, and airline booking. The root cause was traced to a failure in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), preventing websites from accessing data stored in DynamoDB and other services like EC2. Although AWS is generally reliable, experts note that the internet’s heavy dependence on a few cloud providers makes it vulnerable to cascading failures. This incident mirrors past large-scale outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures, highlighting a broader systemic issue: the lack of redundancy and decentralization in modern digital infrastructure. Experts emphasize that while AWS operates at scale, the absence of fallback systems and competition in cloud computing increases the risk of widespread disruption.",
