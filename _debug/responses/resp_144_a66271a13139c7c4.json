  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, centered on a new threat by former President Donald Trump to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China claims its measures are a response to US trade restrictions and national security concerns, particularly targeting Chinese firms in maritime and tech sectors. The two nations have a long history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, including past actions such as Trump's 25% tariffs and Biden’s restrictions on semiconductors and chip-making tools. The current situation, occurring just before a planned meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea, raises concerns about a potential resurgence of a full-scale trade war. Experts suggest that while China appears more strategically organized, the US still holds significant leverage and may avoid full escalation to preserve market stability. The conflict underscores the deepening integration of economic and national security policies in global competition, with both sides using economic tools to project power and gain leverage in negotiations.",
