  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals the exploitation of tens of thousands of Guatemalan maquila workers, particularly women, in garment factories that supply US brands such as Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Despite being central to Guatemala's economy—accounting for nearly 10% of GDP—these factories operate under harsh conditions: long hours, low wages, sexual harassment, wage theft, and threats. Korean companies dominate the industry with minimal oversight, and US brands avoid accountability through subcontracting. Workers face severe risks, including union violence, threats, and dismissal. Even when workers join unions or report abuse, factory owners block inspections and retaliate. While President Bernardo Arévalo introduced reforms like a 6% minimum wage increase, enforcement remains weak. The article underscores a global issue: women are disproportionately exploited in garment supply chains, with financial and psychological harm from years of labor culminating in devastating job losses and pension erosion. The future of these workers is uncertain due to shifting global trade policies and ongoing structural power imbalances.",
