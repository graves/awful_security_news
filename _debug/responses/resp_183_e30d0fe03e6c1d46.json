This has led to large-scale evictions of local families and small business owners, such as those at Tanjung Aan, who are displaced without adequate notice or compensation. While tourism is creating economic opportunities for some, like surf guides and homestay operators, it is also threatening cultural authenticity, environmental sustainability, and traditional livelihoods. Critics, including human rights experts and residents, argue that the 'Balification' of Lombok replicates Bali’s over-tourism problems and violates community rights. Despite government and international financial backing, including a $250 million loan from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the project has sparked significant social and environmental tensions, raising urgent questions about equitable development and the preservation of local identity.",
