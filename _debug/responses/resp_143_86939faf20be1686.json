  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be contributing to illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas in Pará. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: it fails to track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from deforested or illegally occupied lands to be 'laundered' through a system of anonymous transfers. This lack of traceability is compounded by Brazil’s GTAs system, which only records group-level cattle movements and not individual origins. The state animal health agency Adepará has authorized cattle transport into protected Indigenous and sustainable areas, such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, enabling illegal ranching. JBS acknowledged in 2024 that it cannot verify the legality of cattle origins, and its past commitments to supply chain transparency — including a 2009 pledge to identify all indirect suppliers — have not been fulfilled. While Pará's governor and the federal Ministry of Agriculture have introduced traceability mandates by 2026 and 2032 respectively, advocacy groups warn that these timelines are too slow and that immediate, enforceable reforms are needed to stop deforestation and protect Indigenous communities and biodiversity.",
