  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a U.S. military strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean suspected of carrying drugs, two survivors were repatriated: an Ecuadorian man, Andrés Fernando Tufiño, who was cleared of any criminal activity by Ecuadorian prosecutors due to lack of evidence, and a Colombian citizen who remains hospitalized and will be prosecuted. The U.S. government, under President Trump, claims the vessel carried mostly fentanyl and that the actions constitute an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, drawing a comparison to the George W. Bush administration’s post-9/11 war on terrorism. However, there is little evidence that fentanyl is produced in the Andes, raising questions about the validity of the claims. The attacks have intensified diplomatic tensions, with Colombia recalling its ambassador and accusing the U.S. of killing a citizen, while Ecuador reaffirmed its commitment to global anti-drug efforts and regional unity. The incident marks at least the sixth such strike since September, with 32 deaths reported, sparking regional concern over the impact of U.S. military intervention in sovereign territory.",
