  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of AI voice scams targeting wealthy Italian businessmen has emerged, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to clone the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request large financial transfers. The scam, which involved calls claiming to be from Crosetto’s office or staff, was exposed when Crosetto publicly denounced the calls, which he claimed were impossible. Research by Queen Mary University of London shows that AI-generated voice clones are now as realistic as real human voices, with participants often rating them as more trustworthy. The threat extends beyond scams to include the creation of fake news and illegal sexual content, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material. Governments, including the U.S. and Australia, are now enacting laws to criminalize the distribution of AI-generated intimate images, while AI voice technology is also being used positively to restore speech for people who cannot speak. This growing sophistication of AI voice generation raises serious concerns about identity theft, public trust, and the integrity of political and personal communication.",
