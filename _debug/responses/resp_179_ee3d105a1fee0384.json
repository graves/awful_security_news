  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Ukrainian city of Chernihiv suffered a massive Russian attack involving over 100 Iranian-designed Shahed drones and six ballistic missiles, resulting in a total blackout and casualties. The assault targeted civilian infrastructure such as power plants, water pumping stations, and petrol stations, with four people killed and ten injured. Officials, including Andriy Podorvan, argue that the attacks are not targeting military objectives but are aimed at undermining civilian morale and resilience. Despite the destruction, residents show strong unity and continue daily activities, relying on back-up generators and mutual aid. The attack reflects a broader Russian strategy to degrade Ukraine’s energy and civilian infrastructure, especially in regions near Russia and Belarus. With energy restoration delayed due to long production times for equipment like transformers, Ukraine is seeking international assistance—particularly from US energy firms—to rebuild and modernize its energy sector. The total damage to Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is estimated at over $16 billion, signaling both economic and psychological strain as winter approaches.",
