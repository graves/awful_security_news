  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In 2013, Ian Cleary sexually assaulted Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College, a case that remained unresolved for over a decade due to systemic failures in campus sexual assault prosecution. Keeler pursued charges for years, only to face obstacles including destroyed evidence and prosecutorial reluctance. Cleary was eventually tracked down in France in 2024, extradited to Pennsylvania, and sentenced to two to four years in prison in 2025 after a guilty plea. The judge considered Cleary’s remorse and history of mental illness, resulting in a sentence below state guidelines. The case underscores broader issues in how institutions respond to campus sexual violence, including delayed justice, lack of evidence preservation, and the trauma endured by survivors. Keeler described the long years of silence and systemic failure as a painful journey, culminating in a moment of accountability that, though delayed, finally delivered justice.",
