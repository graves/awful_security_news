  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The October 21, 2025, AWS outage exposed the global vulnerability of digital infrastructure, revealing that critical services such as banking and government operations in the UK are heavily dependent on a few US tech firms—particularly Amazon and Microsoft. With AWS and Azure holding 30–40% of the UK cloud market, the outage demonstrated how a single failure in cloud computing can cause widespread disruptions. Experts point to 'nested dependencies' and economies of scale as reasons for this reliance, which makes migration to alternative providers costly and technically difficult. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has flagged poor market competition and recommended designating AWS and Azure as having 'strategic market status' to ensure fair competition. Experts and policymakers are now urging the UK government to mandate multi-cloud strategies, enforce data resilience standards, and promote national digital sovereignty to reduce risks from over-concentration in US cloud services.",
