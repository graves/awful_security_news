A test of these models revealed that they frequently recommended fringe parties like the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) and the left-wing Green Left-Labour Party, while significantly under-representing centrist parties like Democrats 66 and the VVD. The watchdog stresses that AI models are untransparent, unverifiable, and provide biased, polarized political advice, which threatens the integrity of democratic elections. The warning is especially urgent ahead of the October 29 parliamentary elections, where the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, is expected to win the most seats but likely fall short of a majority. Major parties have declined to support the PVV, highlighting the instability of current political alliances and the potential for AI to skew voter perceptions.",
