The move follows a similar incident in July when the U.S. recalled its ambassador, John T.

The conflict intensified after President Donald Trump accused Petro of being a drug trafficker and threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian exports. U.S. warships have launched missile attacks on seven suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean, resulting in at least 30 deaths, with Petro claiming some victims were Colombian citizens and accusing the U.S. of murder. A Colombian citizen aboard the latest vessel was returned alive, and the situation remains a flashpoint in bilateral relations, highlighting deepening mistrust and the intersection of security, economics, and political rhetoric.",
