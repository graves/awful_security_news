  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article chronicles the work of Leslie Cornfeld, a former federal civil rights prosecutor and education advisor, who launched the National Education Equity Lab in 2019 to address systemic inequities in college access for low-income students. Drawing on research showing elite universities are the least diverse in socioeconomic terms, Cornfeld developed the National Education Opportunity Network (NEON), which delivers college-level courses — such as Harvard’s poetry class — directly into Title I high schools. The model includes teacher training, student mentorship, and college preparation support. NEON has expanded to serve over 40,000 students across 33 states, with 80% pass rates and strong post-graduation outcomes: NEON students are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges and persist in them. Supported by the Carnegie Corporation, Gates Foundation, and others, and backed by individual donors like Henry McCance, NEON aims to serve 1 million students in Title I schools within a decade. The article positions education as a civil rights issue and contrasts NEON’s success with failed large-scale interventions like the Gates Foundation's Small Schools Initiative or Mark Zuckerberg’s Newark investment, emphasizing that smaller, evidence-based models can be more effective.",
