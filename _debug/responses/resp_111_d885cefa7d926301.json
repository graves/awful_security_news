    "The 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race is one of the few odd-year state elections in the U.S. and is attracting national attention due to its close polling and personal attacks between candidates.",
    "Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a pro-Trump small business owner and former state Assembly member, in a closely contested race.",
    "President Donald Trump has endorsed Ciattarelli and plans to host tele-rallies for him, while former President Barack Obama endorsed Sherrill, calling her the 'right choice' for governor.",
    "A key issue is affordability and cost of living, with New Jersey's energy costs rising significantly—up 17% to 20% in June—sparking voter concern over utility prices and housing costs.",
    "The campaign has become highly personal: Ciattarelli accused Sherrill of being barred from walking at her naval academy graduation due to a cheating scandal; Sherrill accused Ciattarelli's company of downplaying opioid dangers and claimed he caused tens of thousands of deaths.",
    "Ciattarelli has threatened legal action against Sherrill for defamation over claims of mass deaths, calling her statements 'baselessly and recklessly' made.",
    "Despite a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage for Democrats, New Jersey has a history of purple gubernatorial elections, and this race may be the first since the 1960s where a governor from the same party serves three consecutive terms.",
    "Political experts note that voters are more concerned about affordability and cost of living than personal attacks, making messaging on economic issues critical."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race is drawing national attention due to its unexpectedly close polling and intense personal attacks between Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Despite New Jersey's traditionally blue political leanings in presidential and Senate races, the state has a history of purple gubernatorial outcomes. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, has received endorsements from former President Barack Obama and is focusing on affordability, including rising energy costs and housing shortages. Ciattarelli, a pro-Trump politician and former Assembly member, has drawn support from President Donald Trump, who endorsed him despite past criticism of Trump, and has faced accusations from Sherrill of downplaying opioid risks and causing mass deaths. The campaign has turned highly personal, with both candidates citing past events—Sherrill’s blocked graduation and Ciattarelli’s medical publishing firm—to attack each other. While Democrats hold a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage, experts stress that affordability and cost of living will be decisive factors for voters, suggesting that the outcome may hinge on which candidate better communicates economic relief and policy solutions.",
