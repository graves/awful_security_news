  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new and expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added ones (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium), and on specialized refining equipment. The restrictions, effective from December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain Beijing approval and justify the intended use of products containing rare-earth metals. China cites national security concerns, particularly the unauthorized transfer of rare-earth materials to military uses, as justification. The move comes just weeks before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, positioning the controls as a strategic signal to strengthen China’s bargaining power. The U.S. is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, with 70% of its imports originating from China, and relies on these metals for critical defence technologies such as fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors. Experts from CSIS and the University of Montana describe this as a deliberate 'pre-meeting choreography' to leverage China's dominant position in the rare-earth supply chain, deepening the U.S. technological and industrial vulnerabilities during ongoing trade negotiations.",
