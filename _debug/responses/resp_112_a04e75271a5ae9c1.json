    "Kenny Loggins has publicly objected to the use of his performance of 'Danger Zone' in an AI-generated video posted by President Donald Trump on Truth Social, demanding its immediate removal.",
    "The video falsely depicts President Trump in a fighter jet with the message 'KING TRUMP' and features Loggins singing 'Danger Zone' as the plane releases material over protesters in Times Square, which is seen as politically provocative and potentially inciting division.",
    "Loggins emphasizes that the use of his music in a video designed to divide Americans is inappropriate, stating that music should unite rather than polarize, and that such actions go against shared American values.",
    "Although the use of music in political media is generally legal if proper rights are paid, performers can specifically prohibit use in campaign ads, and artists often make public objections to draw attention to ethical concerns.",
    "The controversy reflects a broader pattern of musicians challenging political figures for unauthorized use of their work, such as The White Stripes and Isaac Hayes' estate, with some legal actions ongoing.",
    "The White House has not directly responded to Loggins' request, instead sharing a reference to the film 'Top Gun' with the caption 'I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED', suggesting a symbolic connection to the music and film context.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins has called for the immediate removal of his performance of 'Danger Zone' from an AI-generated video posted by President Donald Trump on Truth Social. The video, which shows a crown-wearing Trump in a fighter jet with the message 'KING TRUMP' and features Loggins singing 'Danger Zone' as it dumps sludge over protesters in Times Square, was posted in response to widespread 'No Kings' protests. Loggins argues that the use of his music in a politically charged, divisive context is inappropriate and contrary to American unity. While such use is generally legal if proper licensing occurs, performers can specifically prohibit certain uses, and many artists choose to make public objections to highlight ethical concerns. The incident is part of a broader history of musicians challenging political figures over unauthorized use of their music, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, who are continuing legal action. The White House has not directly responded to Logginsâ€™ request, instead sharing a 'Top Gun' film image with a reference to speed and action.",
