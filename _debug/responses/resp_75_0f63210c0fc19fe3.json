  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Unauthorized pro-Palestinian political messages, praising Hamas and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were broadcast through public address systems at four North American airports—Harrisburg (Pennsylvania), Kelowna (British Columbia), Victoria (Ontario), and Windsor (Ontario)—on October 17, 2025. The incidents, which included access to flight information displays and PA systems, caused operational disruptions, passenger confusion, and prompted investigations by federal authorities, including the U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Transport Canada, the FAA, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. While no physical threats or safety risks were reported, the events raise serious concerns about the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure in the air travel industry, especially given a prior history of cyberattacks on airlines. The messages were removed, and operations were restored, but the incidents underscore vulnerabilities in cloud-based software and public communication systems that could be exploited for political disinformation.",
