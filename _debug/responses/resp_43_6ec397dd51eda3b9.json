Haimi, the 13th such hostage identified since October 9, 2025, is the latest in a series of bodies being transferred by Hamas, amid growing concerns over Hamas’s ability to recover all deceased hostages due to war damage and possible misidentifications. The Israeli military and political leadership, including Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, have stressed the absolute necessity of returning all deceased hostages. The US, led by President Donald Trump and officials like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, continues to push for compliance, with Trump threatening to 'eradicate' Hamas if it violates the ceasefire. High-level diplomatic meetings between Israeli military leaders and US envoys underscore the geopolitical urgency of ensuring the ceasefire’s integrity and the human rights aspect of returning missing persons.",
