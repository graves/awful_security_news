  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), under the United Nations, has issued a global call to action to improve early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of the world’s countries lack adequate systems, resulting in thousands of deaths—especially in developing nations. Over the past 50 years, weather-related disasters have killed over 2 million people, with 90% of deaths occurring in vulnerable regions. While progress has been made with 108 countries now using early warnings, half still have only basic capacity. Real-world examples like the 2025 glacier collapse in Switzerland and floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US highlight the urgency. The WMO and local leaders emphasize that early warnings must lead to early action, and that building monitoring capacity—especially in fragile and conflict-affected areas—is vital to saving lives and protecting infrastructure.",
