    "Prince Andrew paid a total of approximately £8 million upfront in 2003 to secure a 75-year lease on Royal Lodge, including £5 million for renovations and £2.5 million for buying out future rent obligations.",
    "The lease includes no annual rent, with the term described as a 'peppercorn' rent — a symbolic or negligible sum, effectively zero.",
    "Prince Andrew is required to maintain the property, including painting every seven years, repainting stonework every five years, and maintaining gardens and security.",
    "The lease prohibits helicopters from landing and gambling on the premises, reflecting the property's security and restriction-based nature.",
    "The arrangement was financially favorable to the Crown Estate, as it avoided taxpayer-funded 'grace and favour' housing, and the renovations improved the property's value.",
    "The deal is seen as a precedent, similar to Prince Edward's 1998 lease on Bagshot Park, where upfront payments were made for renovations and future rent.",
    "The National Audit Office (NAO) confirmed the deal met the Crown Estate's value-for-money criteria and that taxpayers received 'money's worth'.",
    "Prince Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie can continue using the property under the lease terms.",
    "The lease allows for a partial refund if Prince Andrew leaves early, with the refund amount decreasing over time, reaching about £186,000 per year by 2028.",
    "Public scrutiny has intensified due to Prince Andrew’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, leading to renewed debate over whether he should pay for his living expenses as a member of the royal family.",
    "Political figures such as Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick, and Liberal Democrat spokesperson Lisa Smart have called for Prince Andrew to pay his fair share and live independently, questioning the financial sustainability of his current arrangement.",
    "The lease expires in June 2078, well beyond the expected lifespan of Prince Andrew, and includes provisions allowing his family to continue living there.",
    "The initial notional rent was £260,000 per year, though due to security restrictions, it was not commercially viable to rent the property.",
    "The actual cost of renovations exceeded £7.5 million, surpassing the original £5 million estimate, indicating significant financial outlay by Prince Andrew."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has been able to live in Royal Lodge, a 30-room Grade II-listed mansion in Windsor, through a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate that required him to pay an upfront lump sum of approximately £8 million — including £5 million for renovations and £2.5 million to buy out future rent — in exchange for no annual rent. Despite the lease being structured as a 'peppercorn' rent, Prince Andrew is still responsible for maintaining the property, including painting and landscaping. The arrangement, which was considered financially beneficial to the Crown Estate due to avoided public expenditure, has come under renewed public and political scrutiny following recent allegations from Virginia Giuffre's memoir linking Prince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein. Although the National Audit Office confirmed the deal was 'money’s worth,' political figures including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Robert Jenrick, and Lisa Smart have called for Prince Andrew to pay his fair share and live independently. The lease, which expires in June 2078, allows his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie to continue residing there. Prince Andrew’s ability to reclaim funds from the lease has been reduced over time, with only about £186,000 per year remaining by 2028, further incentivizing his reluctance to leave.",
