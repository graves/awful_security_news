  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the exploitative conditions in Guatemala’s maquila garment factories, where tens of thousands of mostly female workers face long hours, low wages, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Despite being crucial to Guatemala’s economy—accounting for nearly 10% of GDP—these factories operate with minimal oversight, and US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren benefit through subcontracting with Korean-owned intermediaries such as KOA Modas and Sae-A Trading, who bear no legal responsibility for labor violations. Workers report daily quotas, wage theft, and unsafe living conditions, including dirty water and physical abuse. Union activity is suppressed, with threats and even violence—such as the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal—detering worker organization. Government bodies like the Labor Ministry struggle to enforce regulations due to factory resistance, and despite President Bernardo Arévalo’s 6% minimum wage increase, structural power imbalances and fear remain deeply entrenched. The article underscores a global pattern of gendered exploitation in supply chains and highlights the urgent need for transparency, accountability, and structural reform to protect workers from financial and psychological devastation.",
