  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Dozens of people were injured during a memorial event in Kisumu, Kenya, as massive crowds gathered to view the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who died in India’s Kerala state. The unrest follows violent incidents at earlier memorial services in Nairobi, where security forces fired tear gas and weapons, killing at least five people and injuring hundreds. Despite heightened security—including military deployment and aerial surveillance—crowd surges led to injuries from fatigue and distress. Odinga, a key figure in Kenya’s democratic transformation, championed multiparty politics and the 2010 constitution, earning him deep public affection and international admiration. Leaders such as Kenya’s President William Ruto, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and former U.S. President Barack Obama praised his legacy, reinforcing his influence beyond Kenya.",
