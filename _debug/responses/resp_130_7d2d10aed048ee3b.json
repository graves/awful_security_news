The situation is growing more urgent as the November 1 enrollment period for ACA coverage begins, when millions of Americans will have to choose health plans without expanded subsidies. Public concern over rising health costs is rising, and both parties remain unwilling to compromise, with the shutdown threatening to deepen economic and social consequences.",
