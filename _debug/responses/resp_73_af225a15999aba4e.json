  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two cases of clade I mpox in California—first in Long Beach and second in Los Angeles County—may represent the first instances of local transmission of this variant in the U.S. Health officials say the risk to the public remains low, with no confirmed links between the cases or to international travel. The cases are being investigated for potential community spread, and some close contacts have been vaccinated. This development is concerning due to the potential for wider transmission and the weakened public health response caused by a federal government shutdown and CDC staffing reductions. Experts warn that local spread, especially with a virus endemic in Africa, could pose a growing threat if not addressed quickly.",
