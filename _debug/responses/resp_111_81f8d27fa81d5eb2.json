  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill faces off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli in a closely contested election, despite New Jersey’s historically blue political leanings. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, is backed by former President Barack Obama and campaigns against Ciattarelli’s pro-Trump stance and alleged opioid-related policy failures. Ciattarelli, who previously criticized Trump, now receives the president’s endorsement and has launched personal attacks on Sherrill, including claims about her barred graduation and defamation over opioid-related deaths. Both candidates emphasize affordability, with Sherrill highlighting rising energy costs and housing shortages, and Ciattarelli promoting fiscal management through his accounting background. The race is notable for its personal intensity, national political involvement, and the historical context of New Jersey’s purple gubernatorial pattern. If Sherrill wins, she would be the first governor since the 1960s to serve three consecutive terms from the same party.",
