Federal workers like Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams report being forced to rely on food banks due to unpaid wages and mounting rent costs, highlighting the instability of federal employment. A joint event organized by the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries in Landover, Maryland, served over 370 households—significantly exceeding expectations—demonstrating the scale of demand. The crisis has prompted a legislative debate, with GOP Senator Ron Johnson advocating for partial pay for workers who remain employed, while Democrats call for universal compensation. The event underscores both the human cost of political gridlock and the critical role of community organizations in providing emergency support to vulnerable federal employees.",
