  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York Democratic primary has marked a turning point for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), making it the largest electoral success in the organization’s history. With a national membership now at 80,000 and a significant grassroots surge in New York City, the DSA is witnessing a dramatic shift in Democratic Party dynamics, driven by public disillusionment with the establishment and a growing demand for bold, policy-driven change. The movement is energized by policies such as single-payer healthcare, rent control, and police abolition, and is closely tied to its support for Palestinian liberation and critique of Israeli policies. While internal debates over ideological purity — including de-endorsements of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and tensions over Palestinian solidarity — persist, the broader trend shows that democratic socialist ideas are gaining mainstream traction among Democrats, especially among younger and working-class voters. Candidates like Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson are following Mamdani’s model, signaling a broader realignment within progressive politics.",
