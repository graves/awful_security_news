  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, with over 50 drones targeting critical facilities in a single night. These attacks, which have occurred on 15 days over the past month, are being used as a tactic to inflict suffering and prolong humanitarian crises. Ukrainian officials blame Russia for deliberately circling damaged facilities to prevent repairs. In response, Ukraine has launched long-range missile attacks on key Russian facilities, such as the Bryansk Chemical Plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging European allies to provide more air defenses and energy equipment, proposing the use of frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—as a source of funding for vital weapons like Patriot air defense systems. Despite this, Ukraine continues to face a lack of US military support, including the expected delivery of Tomahawk missiles. Analysts note a pattern where Russian aggression escalates when US pressure on Russia increases, such as after Trump’s statements suggesting Ukraine may have to give up territory. Zelensky remains skeptical of a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, warning that it could be used to undermine Ukraine’s position. Meanwhile, Ukrainian leaders emphasize that Ukraine remains the only party committed to peace, and that even in dire circumstances, Ukraine holds strategic resilience.",
