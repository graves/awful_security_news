  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court to authorize the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, asserting that federal officials face imminent threats from violent protests and that such actions fall under his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief. The administration argues that lower courts, including the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, improperly interfered by blocking the deployment, citing the 1827 precedent *Martin v. Mott* that reserves sole presidential authority over declaring a national emergency. In contrast, opposing state officials and courts point to the 1932 case *Sterling v. Constantin* to argue that the deployment exceeds 'honest judgment' and should be subject to judicial review. The case highlights a broader constitutional tension between executive power and judicial oversight, with the Supreme Court requested to respond rapidly, indicating the high stakes and urgency of the dispute.",
