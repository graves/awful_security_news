  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has increased to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025, up from 376 in 2024, marking a slow but encouraging recovery after a 25% decline between 2010 and 2020. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA attribute this growth to conservation efforts, including new Canadian management measures in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and improved protection under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Despite continued threats from ship collisions and fishing gear entanglements, recent signs of improved reproduction—such as four new calves and shorter intervals between births—offer cautious optimism. However, environmental groups like Oceana emphasize that the population remains on the brink of extinction and warn that legislative efforts to undermine marine protections could reverse progress. The article underscores the importance of sustained, science-based conservation to ensure long-term survival of this rare and vulnerable species.",
