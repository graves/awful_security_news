  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the international recognition of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by President Donald Trump, Americans show little enthusiasm for the agreement. Public opinion polling indicates that Trump’s approval ratings remain low, with his overall approval at a record low of 37% and strong disapproval at 61%. The article suggests that Americans’ negative views of Trump are rooted not in foreign policy but in his economic record—particularly concerning inflation, the cost of living, and job security. Even though the Gaza deal was seen by some as a major diplomatic win, it has not translated into public support, especially when compared to the growing economic pessimism, with only 32% of Americans expecting economic improvement in the next year. This reflects a broader public sentiment that domestic economic issues are far more important than international diplomacy, with only 4% of Americans considering international events the most pressing national issue.",
