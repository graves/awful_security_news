Haimi, who was defending a kibbutz, is survived by his wife, four children, father, and sister. The body was transferred via the Red Cross from Gaza and identified in Tel Aviv on October 20, 2025, amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to ensure compliance with the ceasefire terms. Hamas is accused of failing to locate and return all deceased hostages due to war damage and logistical challenges, including a prior misidentification of a body.

High-level meetings between Israeli military officials and US envoys in Tel Aviv underscore the urgency of implementing the agreement. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed deep condolences to Haimi’s family, highlighting the emotional toll of prolonged uncertainty and the moral imperative of honoring the dead.",
