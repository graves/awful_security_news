  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In response to growing concerns about misinformation and politicized vaccine guidance from federal officials—including false claims by President Donald Trump and recent CDC advisory changes—city health leaders from the Big Cities Health Coalition have united to emphasize the critical importance of vaccination. The coalition, composed of public health officials from major U.S. cities, warns of rising measles and respiratory disease outbreaks, citing a measles outbreak in upstate South Carolina involving over 100 unvaccinated students. They criticize the CDC and federal government for undermining public trust through politically driven messaging and changes to immunization schedules, such as the recommendation against the MMRV vaccine for children under 4. At the same time, major medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have broken from CDC guidance, adding to the confusion. Local leaders stress the need for science-based, data-driven public health decisions and inter-jurisdictional collaboration, noting that health systems are only as strong as their weakest local jurisdiction. Despite a decline in public trust in the CDC—down to 50% in a KFF poll—the coalition remains committed to promoting vaccination as essential for school safety, community health, and public safety.",
