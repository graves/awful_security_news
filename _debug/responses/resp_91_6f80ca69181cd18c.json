  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, Israel and Hamas exchanged prisoners — with Hamas releasing 20 living hostages and Israel releasing over 1,700 Palestinian detainees — but a major dispute remains over the return of deceased hostages. Hamas has only delivered the remains of nine of the 28 deceased hostages, leading Israel to believe Hamas possesses at least six more bodies. Israel asserts it has intelligence on missing bodies and is working with the US and Turkey to locate them. The United States does not consider Hamas in violation of the agreement and is providing logistical support. Humanitarian aid restrictions were threatened but reversed, with aid now flowing as per ceasefire terms. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum demands full compliance with hostage return obligations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that the 'struggle is not over,' pledging to complete victory and maintain military presence, while key issues like Hamas disarmament and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza remain unresolved.",
