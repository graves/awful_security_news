Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described drug cartels as the 'Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere,' justifying the operation under counter-terrorism principles. This marks a significant shift from traditional Coast Guard interdiction to lethal military action, supported by a classified legal opinion that treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants. The Trump administration has intensified its efforts against drug trafficking networks, including authorizing CIA operations in Venezuela, while facing international criticism, particularly from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US of killing an innocent citizen. The Senate previously blocked a resolution to limit presidential war powers, with bipartisan support from Senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, who voiced deep concern over the lack of due process in these lethal strikes.",
