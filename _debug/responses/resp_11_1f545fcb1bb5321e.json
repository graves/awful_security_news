Family members and supporters, including cousins Anamaria Baralt and Diane Hernandez, testified to the brothers’ transformation and humanity. However, current Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes resentencing, citing fabricated abuse claims and a moderate risk of recidivism. The brothers are pursuing both parole eligibility and a habeas corpus petition for a new trial, citing new evidence such as a 1988 letter. The final decision rests with the California State Parole Board, which will recommend to Governor Gavin Newsom, who has 120 days to approve or deny release.",
