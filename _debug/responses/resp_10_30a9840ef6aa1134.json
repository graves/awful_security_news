  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work has begun to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine after a four-week blackout, the longest since the war began. The IAEA reports that this restoration is being enabled by rare local ceasefire zones established between Ukrainian and Russian forces, allowing engineers to repair damaged off-site power lines. The ZNPP lost its sole power connection last month, forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators for over 20 days. Ukraine blames Russia for intentionally cutting power, while Russia attributes the outage to Ukrainian shelling. Both sides have accused each other of endangering nuclear safety, with Russia claiming it plays a key role in protecting repair efforts amid ongoing shelling. The incident reflects a broader pattern of military targeting of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including a recent strike on Slavutych affecting the Chernobyl site, and underscores the global risk of a radiation incident due to ongoing aggression and occupation of critical facilities.",
