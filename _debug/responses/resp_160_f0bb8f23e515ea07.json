  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, urging both nations to freeze hostilities at current battle lines, particularly in the Donbas region. He suggests that the region should remain divided, with around 78% of land under Russian control, and that future negotiations will resolve territorial disputes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pushed for full territorial recovery and compared Putin to Hamas, calling for increased pressure. Trump previously claimed Ukraine could reclaim all occupied areas, including Crimea, contradicting his current ceasefire stance. He is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary, where diplomatic talks may advance. The proposal marks a shift from former President Joe Biden’s sustained military support to a reduced, more balanced approach, while Ukraine continues to request military aid such as Tomahawk missiles. The war, which began in February 2022, has evolved into a protracted conflict focused in eastern Ukraine.",
