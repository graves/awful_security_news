  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, following a U.S. military strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean suspected of carrying drugs, Ecuadorian citizen Andrés Fernando Tufiño was released due to lack of evidence linking him to any crime. The U.S. claimed the vessel carried fentanyl and other illegal drugs, justifying the attack as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels—similar to the Bush administration’s post-9/11 war rationale. However, experts note that fentanyl is primarily transported through Mexico, not the Andes, raising questions about the validity of the operation. The Colombian government confirmed it would prosecute its own survivor, and recalled its ambassador to the U.S. after President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of killing a Colombian citizen in a prior strike, prompting sharp diplomatic fallout. Meanwhile, Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa publicly defended regional cooperation against drug trafficking, opposing unilateral U.S. military actions. This sequence of events has heightened tensions between the U.S. and key Latin American allies, particularly Colombia, and sparked broader debates over the legality and proportionality of such military strikes.",
