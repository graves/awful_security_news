  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked the side effects of 30 commonly prescribed antidepressants based on data from over 58,500 patients. The research, published in The Lancet, reveals significant physical side effects—including weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure fluctuations—varying widely between drugs. Even within the same diagnosis, patients may benefit from different medications based on pre-existing health conditions. For example, Sarah, John, and Jane—each with depression—would be recommended different antidepressants to avoid weight gain, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. While SSRIs like citalopram and sertraline generally have fewer physical side effects, drugs like fluoxetine show mixed profiles. Experts stress that it is too simplistic to label antidepressants as 'good' or 'bad,' emphasizing personalized treatment. The findings challenge the current UK prescribing trend, where 85% of prescriptions go to just three SSRIs, and suggest that implementing personalized medicine could dramatically reduce this. A free online tool is being developed to aid patients and doctors in shared decision-making, though cultural shifts within the NHS are needed for widespread adoption. The study focused on the first eight weeks of treatment and may not fully capture long-term cumulative risks, especially in chronic depression.",
