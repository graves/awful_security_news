    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "The attack occurred during a public greeting in Handlova, where Cintula shot Fico five times from within one meter, seriously injuring him in the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot.",
    "The court found Cintula guilty of terrorism, not merely murder or assault, citing that his target was specifically the Prime Minister, which is a key legal distinction under terrorism charges.",
    "Cintula stated he aimed to stop Fico's policies that he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture, framing the attack as a 'scream against fear' that paralyzes society.",
    "The verdict reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia between Fico’s populist, pro-Russian policies and the liberal, pro-European opposition, which has accused Fico of undermining democratic norms and media freedom.",
    "Fico, who has been in power since 2006, has returned to power in 2023 and introduced changes including ending military aid to Ukraine and reforming public broadcasting—actions criticized as threats to democracy.",
    "The defense argued that attacks on public officials are not automatically terrorism, but the court rejected this, emphasizing the targeted nature of the attack on a political figure.",
    "Despite the sentence, Cintula claims the verdict is unjust and will appeal, asserting that he acted out of political conviction rather than malice.",
    "Fico has publicly forgiven Cintula, indicating a personal reconciliation despite the severity of the crime.",
    "The case underscores the dangers of political polarization and the potential for violent extremism in democratic societies."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old public activist and former mine worker, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. The attack, which wounded Fico in the abdomen and other areas, led to a lengthy trial in which the court ruled Cintula guilty of terrorism due to the specific targeting of a political leader, distinguishing it from ordinary attacks on officials. Cintula claimed he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and cultural freedom, framing the act as a protest against societal fear. The verdict reflects deep political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accused of undermining democratic norms and the opposition criticizing his pro-Russian and media reform policies. Despite the sentence, Cintula plans to appeal, and Fico has publicly forgave him. The case highlights the risks of political polarization and the legal challenges in defining terrorism in democratic societies.",
