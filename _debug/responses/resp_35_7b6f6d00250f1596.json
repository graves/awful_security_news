  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The federal government shutdown is now in its 21st day, the second-longest in history, with the potential to surpass the 35-day mark from the first Trump administration. Despite Democrats making a popular policy demand—extending Obamacare subsidies—public opinion polls show they are currently winning the blame game, with Americans blaming Republicans more than Democrats by up to 17 points. This shift contrasts with past shutdowns, where the party making the policy demand (like Republicans in 1995–96 and 2018–19) lost public favor and eventually gave in. Now, the political pressure is high, as the expiration of subsidies could lead to premium hikes of up to 100% on health insurance, which may force Republicans to negotiate. Key dynamics include the timing of open enrollment on November 1, and the risk of a Democratic base reacting negatively if the party appears to fold. The article suggests that Democrats may hold out, not only due to policy popularity but because of the potential to shift blame to Republicans and create political leverage.",
