  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, the planet will still experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of extreme heat—compared to pre-2015 projections. While the worst-case scenario of 114 extra days has been reduced by half, the world has already seen 11 more such days since 2015. The study reveals a profound climate injustice: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa are projected to face massive spikes in dangerous heat, with Panama seeing 149 extra days per year, while top emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days despite being responsible for 42% of global CO₂ emissions. Experts like Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto warn of severe human suffering and long-term societal risks, including geopolitical instability, due to this growing inequality in climate impacts.",
