  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is experiencing a major boardroom reshuffle, with seven members—including chairman Helge Lund and vice chairman Henrik Poulsen—stepping down due to a disagreement between the board and its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The Foundation, which holds a significant voting power, pushed for a more extensive reconfiguration of the board, rejecting the board’s proposal to bring in new members with specific skills. The change comes amid rising competition from companies like Eli Lilly, declining investor confidence, and a series of internal shifts, including CEO changes, staff layoffs, and profit forecast cuts. The current chairman of the foundation, Lars Rebien Sorensen—formerly CEO of Novo Nordisk—is being proposed as the new board chairman, reflecting concerns that the company has been slow to adapt to shifting market dynamics.",
