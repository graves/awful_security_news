  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 'yellow line' in Gaza, marking Israel's control of about 53% of the territory under Donald Trump's peace plan, has become a pivotal political and strategic boundary. While initially a temporary demarcation, it is now seen as a potential de facto border, especially by Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners who seek to solidify Israeli control and enable new settlements. Despite Netanyahu’s public threats of war in response to Hamas violations, Israel opted for limited air strikes and a reinstated ceasefire to align with U.S. pressure and avoid escalation. The second stage of the peace plan—centered on Hamas disarmament and power transfer—is still in negotiation, and U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, are urging restraint. This dynamic highlights a growing tension between Netanyahu’s domestic hardline allies and U.S. diplomatic influence, with Israeli commentators suggesting that U.S. leadership is increasingly shaping military decisions in Gaza. The yellow line's fate may ultimately depend on whether the second stage of negotiations can be resolved, with failure potentially leading to its permanent status and significant shifts in Israeli territorial policy.",
