    "President Donald Trump has requested the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, citing a pre-planned ambush involving multiple attackers threatening federal personnel and property.",
    "The Trump administration argues that lower federal courts, including the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, improperly blocked the deployment by overstepping presidential authority and judicially micromanaging the commander-in-chief’s powers.",
    "The administration relies on the 1827 Supreme Court case Martin v. Mott, which holds that the president alone has the authority to determine whether a national emergency exists, and that courts may not review such decisions.",
    "In contrast, states challenging the deployment point to the 1932 case Sterling v. Constantin, where the Supreme Court ruled that courts can review executive decisions outside a ‘range of honest judgment’ — suggesting judicial oversight is possible in certain circumstances.",
    "The Supreme Court has previously sided with Trump in most emergency deployments since January 2025, reinforcing a pattern of deference to executive power in national emergencies.",
    "The case has sparked a significant legal and political debate over the balance of power between the executive branch and the judiciary, especially concerning the use of federalized military forces during domestic unrest.",
    "The Supreme Court requested responses from state and local officials by Monday evening — a faster-than-usual turnaround — indicating urgency and potential for a rapid decision."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has urged the U.S. Supreme Court to authorize the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, claiming that federal officials face imminent threats from a pre-planned, multi-attacker ambush. This move comes after lower courts, including the 7th Circuit, blocked the deployment, citing concerns that Trump overstated the danger. The administration argues that such decisions fall under the president’s exclusive authority, citing the 1827 Supreme Court case Martin v. Mott, which affirmed presidential supremacy in declaring emergencies. In contrast, state officials and judges like April Perry argue that protests are not equivalent to riots and that judicial review is possible when executive decisions exceed a 'range of honest judgment,' referencing the 1932 case Sterling v. Constantin. The Supreme Court, which has previously favored the president in similar cases, is now asked to rule on whether federal courts can interfere with presidential military deployment decisions, with a request for responses from state and local officials by Monday — indicating urgent and consequential proceedings.",
