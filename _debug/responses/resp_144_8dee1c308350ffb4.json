  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade and technological conflict between the United States and China, centered on a 100% tariff threat from US President Donald Trump in response to China’s export controls on rare earth minerals. China, which holds a near-monopoly on these critical minerals used in electronics and defense, accused the US of double standards and discriminatory practices, particularly in targeting Chinese firms in technology and maritime sectors. This dispute comes amid diplomatic tensions, with both leaders expected to meet in South Korea, though the trade war threatens to derail negotiations. The history of US-China trade measures includes past tariff escalations, such as the 10% to 25% tariffs under Trump and the 34% reciprocal tariffs, as well as Biden-era restrictions on semiconductors, chipmaking tools, and tech exports to China. China has responded with increased restrictions on rare earth exports and technological equipment, framed as a national security measure. Experts argue that while China has shown greater strategic preparation, the US still holds significant economic leverage. The situation reflects a broader trend of both nations weaponizing economic interdependence, with global markets and supply chains facing uncertainty as both sides maintain escalation tools in reserve.",
