  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article by Jeanne Sahadi for CNN promotes the KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart) investing strategy, arguing that most active fund managers fail to outperform passive index funds. Data from Morningstar shows that only 21% of active funds beat their passive counterparts over a 10-year period, and just 7.1% of large cap blend funds outperformed index funds over 20 years. The article recommends that individuals adopt simple, low-cost portfolios—such as target-date funds or a mix of U.S. and international stocks and bonds—because they reduce decision fatigue, improve financial clarity, and are easier to manage or pass on. It also highlights the psychological and practical benefits of simplicity, especially for older adults or those with cognitive impairments, and emphasizes that strong savings habits are more important than chasing high returns.",
