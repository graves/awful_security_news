    "Under current commitments, warming is limited to 2.6°C, reducing the annual increase in superhot days to 57, nearly half the worst-case scenario.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already experienced 11 additional superhot days on average.",
    "Small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face the largest increases in dangerous heat days, with Panama projected to see 149 extra superhot days annually.",
    "These 10 countries collectively produce only 1% of global heat-trapping gases, highlighting a massive disconnect between carbon emissions and heat exposure.",
    "The top carbon-polluting countries—United States, China, and India—despite accounting for 42% of global CO2 emissions, face only 23–30 extra superhot days.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current climate commitments, the Earth will experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat—due to climate change. This is a significant improvement from the pre-Paris scenario, which would have added 114 such days under a 4°C warming path. However, the study reveals a stark global inequality: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat exposure—up to 149 extra days annually—while major emitters such as the United States, China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that this disparity reflects deeper inequities in climate justice, potentially fueling future geopolitical tensions. The report underscores that climate change impacts are not evenly distributed, with vulnerable nations bearing the brunt despite minimal responsibility in emissions.",
