  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports on the release of Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a survivor of a U.S. military strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean, after Ecuadorian prosecutors found no evidence of criminal activity. The U.S. administration, led by former President Donald Trump, claimed the vessel was transporting fentanyl and other drugs, justifying lethal force as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels. However, there is limited evidence that fentanyl is produced in the Andes, and the attacks have sparked significant diplomatic tensions, especially between the U.S. and Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of killing a citizen. Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the U.S., while Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa has expressed support for regional cooperation and peace. The strikes, which have now reached at least seven since September, have led to 32 deaths and heightened regional instability, with critics questioning the legality and proportionality of the U.S. military actions.",
