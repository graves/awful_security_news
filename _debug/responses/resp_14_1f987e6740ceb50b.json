  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A high-profile heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday, October 20, 2025, resulted in the theft of valuable royal jewelry, including a tiara and necklace from Queen Marie-Amélie, and an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise in 1810. The thieves, believed to be armed with tools like an angle grinder and blowtorch, used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery through a window, completing the robbery in just seven minutes. The total value of the stolen items is estimated at $102 million (88 million euros). Despite investigations involving around 100 agents and the recovery of one scooter and a helmet, officials remain pessimistic about recovery, with experts suggesting the items may have been dismantled and sold on the black market for money laundering. The incident has exposed serious security flaws at the museum, prompting national outrage and political statements from French officials, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin. Historically, such heists are rare, with the 1911 Mona Lisa theft being a notable precedent. Experts believe the stolen pieces are likely permanently lost, and the heist has become a symbol of cultural vulnerability in France.",
