    "President Donald Trump suggested that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be priced at $150 per month, referencing a price point in Europe and calling it a 'dramatic' improvement.",
    "The proposal originated during a news conference about in vitro fertilization drugs, but was linked to weight-loss drugs after a reporter asked if Trump was referring to Ozempic.",
    "Dr. Mehmet Oz, the President’s doctor and CMS administrator, clarified that the price reduction had not been negotiated and was not a done deal, emphasizing it would be rolled out over time.",
    "Stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dropped significantly (around 4%) in response to the announcement, signaling investor concern over potential price reductions.",
    "GLP-1 drugs are currently priced at $1,000 or more per month in the US, with many patients facing out-of-pocket costs as high as $500/month or more, especially without insurance.",
    "Compounders offer cheaper, unregulated versions of GLP-1 drugs (e.g., $150/month), but experts warn about safety and efficacy risks due to lack of regulation.",
    "Experts and doctors, including Dr. William Feldman and Dr. Jody Dushay, note that $150/month would greatly improve patient access and could increase medication use, but it remains speculative and unconfirmed.",
    "The proposal aligns with the 'Most Favored Nation' executive order, under which the US would not pay more than the lowest price offered in peer countries, and has precedent in other drug deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and EMD Serono.",
    "Despite the appeal, experts like Dr. Jared Holz and Dr. David Kim caution that the $150 price is unlikely to materialize soon and may be a strategic move to prompt negotiations rather than a concrete promise.",
    "Patients like Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell have personally experienced the financial hardship of high drug costs and expressed strong interest in accessing branded drugs at lower prices."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump suggested during an Oval Office news conference that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be priced at $150 per month, citing a contrast in pricing between the US and Europe. While the idea sparked hope among patients and doctors who have struggled with high drug costs—many paying over $500/month or relying on unregulated compounded versions—the White House and Dr. Mehmet Oz, the CMS administrator, quickly clarified that no such price reduction had been negotiated or finalized. Market reactions were immediate, with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly stock prices dropping significantly. Experts remain skeptical about the feasibility of the $150 price, noting it would require major policy changes, and highlight safety concerns with compounded drugs. While the proposal aligns with the administration’s 'Most Favored Nation' drug pricing strategy and could significantly improve access to GLP-1 medications, it remains speculative and likely a negotiating tactic rather than a guaranteed outcome. Patients like Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell express strong interest in transitioning to branded, regulated drugs if affordable pricing is achieved.",
