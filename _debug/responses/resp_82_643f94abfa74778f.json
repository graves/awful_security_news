  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s role as lead defense attorney for former FBI Director James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Prosecutors argue that the communications between Comey and Fitzgerald, including seven memoranda about troubling interactions with President Trump, raise potential conflict-of-interest concerns, suggesting Fitzgerald may be disqualified. However, Fitzgerald and his legal team contend that the memos were unclassified at the time they were shared, citing an inspector general report that found no evidence of classified material being released. The case highlights a complex legal and ethical dilemma regarding attorney-client privilege, the handling of sensitive information, and the rules governing a lawyer's representation when they are also a witness.",
