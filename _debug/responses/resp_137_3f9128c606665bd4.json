  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has agreed to stop using royal titles such as Duke of York following renewed allegations of inappropriate behavior and contacts with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, especially in light of claims by victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre that she had sex with him when she was 17. Despite renouncing some titles, Andrew retains his status as a prince and continues to hold the dukedom granted by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The revelations, including a posthumous memoir by Giuffre and claims that Andrew attempted to smear her by asking a police bodyguard to investigate her background, have sparked public outrage and political pressure. Opposition politicians like Stephen Flynn are calling for legislative action to strip both Andrew and Peter Mandelson of their titles, while the UK government and Buckingham Palace maintain that such actions fall outside their constitutional role. Questions remain about the propriety of Prince Andrew’s continued residence at Royal Lodge, which he rents from the Crown Estate. The Metropolitan Police are investigating allegations that Andrew sought to discredit Giuffre in 2011, and public anger persists over the monarchy’s response to these serious allegations.",
