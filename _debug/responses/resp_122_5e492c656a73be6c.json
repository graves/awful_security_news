  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court is set to consider whether people who regularly use marijuana can legally own guns, following a case revived by the Trump administration involving Texas man Ali Danial Hemani. Hemani was charged with a gun possession felony after being found with a firearm in his home, despite being a regular marijuana user. A lower court ruled that a blanket ban on gun ownership for drug users violates the Second Amendment, which was expanded in 2022 to protect broader gun rights. The Justice Department argues the law is justified due to public safety risks, citing evidence from a federal investigation. Hemani’s legal team claims the law unfairly criminalizes millions of Americans who have used marijuana, especially given that 20% of U.S. adults have done so and half of states now allow recreational use. The case could set a major precedent on how drug use intersects with gun ownership, with arguments expected in early 2026 and a decision likely by early summer 2026.",
