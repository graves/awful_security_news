Duffy suggested that NASA might open the contract to competitors, prompting Musk to highlight SpaceX’s achievements, such as being the only U.S. company to successfully human-certify a new orbital vehicle. Meanwhile, Jared Isaacman, a SpaceX-connected space explorer, has reportedly returned to the running for NASA administrator, despite having previously been withdrawn by Trump. Isaacman has expressed respect for Duffy and no confidence in his own renomination, while Duffy’s office clarified he has no intention of becoming NASA’s permanent leader and only supports the President’s nominee. The dispute reflects broader tensions between private space companies and government agencies, and underscores the geopolitical competition in space with China.",
