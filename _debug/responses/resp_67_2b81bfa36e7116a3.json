  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Department of Justice is defending the appointment of Alina Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, arguing that her role is valid under delegated authority from the Attorney General and that such appointments are not uncommon. A federal appeals court panel, including judges appointed by Reagan, Bush, and Obama, is weighing whether the appointment violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which requires Senate confirmation for such roles. A lower court previously ruled that Habba’s appointment was unlawful, citing that the position should be filled by the first assistant US attorney or a confirmed appointee. The DOJ claims Habba has been serving through delegation and that this process follows established administrative practices, though legal experts argue that full US attorney powers cannot be delegated and that this instance is unprecedented. The controversy has broader implications, with similar challenges underway in Nevada and California, and ties to ongoing legal disputes involving former FBI Director James Comey and former White House aide Lindsey Halligan, who is now a U.S. Attorney. Habba has attributed the delays in appointments to congressional obstruction, emphasizing that the presidential mandate should not be undermined.",
