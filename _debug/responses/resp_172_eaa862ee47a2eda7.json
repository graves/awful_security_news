    "A man named Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old pensioner and amateur poet, was sentenced to 21 years in prison for shooting Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "The attack occurred during a public visit in Handlova, 180km from Bratislava, when Cintula mistakenly believed Fico was a supporter and fired at extremely close range.",
    "Cintula claimed he only intended to injure Fico and not kill him, stating he aimed away from vital organs, but the court found the attack to be a terrorism-related act targeting a public figure.",

    "The sentencing reflects broader concerns about political polarization, hate rhetoric, and the potential for violence in democratic societies.",
    "The Slovak PM has publicly blamed opposition leaders for fueling hostility, though Fico himself is known for divisive political statements."
