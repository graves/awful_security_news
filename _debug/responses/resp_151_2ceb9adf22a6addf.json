  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli military strikes in southern Gaza killed at least 35 Palestinians, following claims that Hamas fighters attacked Israeli troops in Rafah. While Hamas denies any involvement, citing a blockade and severed contact in the area, Israel responded with retaliatory strikes and halted humanitarian aid. Multiple attacks on hospitals and refugee camps across Gaza caused additional civilian deaths. The US alleges Hamas will violate the ceasefire, which Hamas rejects as false propaganda. Both sides remain in a state of heightened tension, with Israeli hardline officials calling for full combat resumption and Hamas demanding international pressure to end Israeli support for armed groups. The ceasefire is viewed as fragile, with recovery efforts delayed due to rubble and military control. The return of captive remains remains a point of political pressure, with Israel demanding more bodies from Hamas.",
