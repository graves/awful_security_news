    "The GOP, especially President Donald Trump and allies, has engaged in exaggerated rhetoric suggesting the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists, despite evidence showing the rallies were largely peaceful.",
    "Multiple Republican officials—House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Roger Marshall, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt—have made sweeping, baseless claims linking the rallies to terrorism or violent extremism.",
    "The rhetoric mirrors past Republican accusations, such as calling Trump supporters 'basket of deplorables' or calling Biden's remarks 'garbage,' showing a pattern of broad, dehumanizing political attacks.",
    "Historical data shows that the June 'No Kings' rallies were overwhelmingly peaceful, with only a few alleged incidents of violence, some of which involved counter-protesters or individuals acting in self-defense.",
    "Democratic leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Ruben Gallego have condemned the GOP rhetoric as an attempt to justify militarization and incite fear, noting that such claims are not supported by facts or public sentiment.",
    "Public opinion polling indicates a near-even split between Americans on whether left-wing or right-wing violence is a bigger problem, and a clear majority view that the Republican Party is more extreme than the Democratic Party.",
    "This rhetoric serves a strategic purpose: to create a narrative of left-wing violence that could justify increased government surveillance, militarization, and crackdowns on political dissent."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Republican Party, led by President Donald Trump and key officials such as Mike Johnson, Tom Emmer, Roger Marshall, Sean Duffy, Scott Bessent, and Karoline Leavitt, has launched a campaign of exaggerated and baseless rhetoric claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies—held across the U.S. and largely peaceful—will be filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists. This narrative, which echoes past Republican attacks on Trump supporters, is strategically aimed at justifying increased government militarization and political control. Despite evidence from past rallies and polling data indicating that left-wing violence is not more prevalent than right-wing violence and that public opinion is largely neutral or skeptical, GOP leaders continue to propagate fear-based narratives. Democratic officials and public sentiment, including polling from Marquette University Law School and CBS News-YouGov, challenge this narrative, emphasizing that the events are peaceful and that such rhetoric risks enabling authoritarian overreach.",
