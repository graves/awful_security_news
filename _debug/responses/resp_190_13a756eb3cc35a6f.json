  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "French police are urgently trying to recover jewels stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris during a swift daylight heist, where thieves reportedly broke in and removed eight valuable items in just eight minutes before escaping on scooters. Experts, including Dutch art detective Arthur Brand and jewellery historian Carol Woolton, believe the thieves were professionals with prior criminal experience, and that the jewels were likely dismantled—gold and silver melted down, gemstones cut into smaller pieces—making recovery extremely difficult. The stolen items, including the Empress Eugénie’s tiara with rare natural pearls, are expected to be sold for a fraction of their original value, potentially fetching up to £10 million. Authorities suspect the theft was carried out by an organized crime network involved in money laundering, and are analyzing DNA from left-behind evidence to identify suspects. While a precedent exists where stolen jewellery resurfaced years later, experts say the chances of the items being recovered intact are diminishing. The theft has sparked deep national emotion in France, as people view the jewels as part of shared national heritage, comparable to the loss of the Mona Lisa.",
