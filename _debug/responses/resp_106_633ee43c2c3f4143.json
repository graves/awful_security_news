  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, arguing that federal personnel face imminent danger due to lawlessness in Chicago.

These actions have sparked legal challenges from state officials, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who argue that such deployments violate constitutional norms and state sovereignty. Texas Governor Greg Abbott also sent troops to Illinois, showing cross-state political alignment. The Supreme Court has now asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond by Monday, marking a pivotal moment in the national debate over executive power, military intervention in civilian affairs, and the balance between federal and state authority.",
