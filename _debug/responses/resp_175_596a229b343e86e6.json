    "The Prima implant is a revolutionary microchip implanted at the back of the eye that enables patients with geographic atrophy (GA) to regain central vision and read again.",
    "Of 32 patients in a multinational trial, 27 were able to read using their central vision, representing a significant improvement of 25 letters (five lines) on an eye chart after one year.",
    "The implant works by receiving infrared video images from special glasses, processing them, and sending enhanced visuals directly to the brain via the optic nerve.",
    "Sheila Irvine, a 70-year-old patient with advanced dry AMD, regained the ability to read books, post, crosswords, and Sudoku — a transformation she described as 'out of this world'.",
    "The technology is still experimental and not licensed for public use; availability on the NHS is uncertain but hoped for within a few years.",
    "The Prima implant is not effective for conditions involving non-functional optic nerves, limiting its application to certain forms of retinal degeneration like geographic atrophy.",
    "Dr. Peter Bloomfield of the Macular Society sees the results as 'encouraging' and 'fantastic news' for those with no current treatment options in dry AMD."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A groundbreaking eye implant called the Prima, developed by California biotech Science Corporation and tested in a multinational trial at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, has enabled patients with geographic atrophy (GA)—a severe form of dry age-related macular degeneration—to regain central vision and read again. Of 32 patients in the trial, 27 successfully read using the implant, showing a 25-letter improvement on eye charts after one year. The device, a 2mm-square microchip implanted under the retina, receives infrared video from special glasses, processes the images, and sends them to the brain via the optic nerve. Sheila Irvine, a 70-year-old patient with over 30 years of vision loss, described the experience as 'out of this world' and now reads books, crosswords, and Sudoku. While not yet licensed for public use and not approved on the NHS, researchers like Mahi Muqit and Dr. Peter Bloomfield believe the technology offers a major advance in treating a previously untreatable condition, with potential for future expansion to other eye disorders. The trial results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent a significant milestone in artificial vision and offer renewed hope to millions affected by geographic atrophy.",
