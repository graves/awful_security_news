  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Madagascar, a youth-led movement known as Gen Z Mada has protested against the appointment of businessman Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo as prime minister, claiming the decision was made without transparency or consultation and contradicts the movement’s goal of structural political change. The protests began over grievances such as frequent water and power outages and escalated into a nationwide demand for reform, culminating in the military takeover led by Col Michael Randrianirina, who was sworn in as head of state on 17 October 2025. While Randrianirina thanked the youth for their role in driving change, Gen Z Mada remains vigilant, asserting that their revolution will not be hijacked and threatening continued mobilization if the prime ministerial appointment is not explained or reversed.",
