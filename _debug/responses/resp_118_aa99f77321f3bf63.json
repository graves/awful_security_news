    "The term 'enshittification' describes a process in which internet platforms—such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Amazon—evolve from being user-friendly and innovative to becoming exploitative and degrading to users and business customers.",
    "Doctorow identifies three stages of enshittification: Stage 1 (user acquisition), Stage 2 (favoring business customers), and Stage 3 (exploitation and profit maximization, leading to degradation of user experience and fair competition).",
    "In Stage 3, platforms like Facebook and Amazon are accused of manipulating algorithms, charging junk fees, forcing content boosting, and cloning products, which harms both users and small merchants.",
    "The degradation is attributed to a lack of competition and weak regulatory oversight, with platforms protected by network effects and high switching costs.",
    "Doctorow proposes solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, the abandonment of the consumer welfare standard, and increased interoperability between platforms (e.g., allowing users to transfer data and devices across platforms).",
    "The theory is challenged by Amazon, which claims its services have improved and denies claims of cloning, junk fees, or algorithmic bias."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow, a prominent internet activist and journalist, presents a theory of 'enshittification'—the degradation of internet platforms from user-friendly beginnings into exploitative systems—using Facebook, Google, Uber, and Amazon as case studies. He outlines three stages: in Stage 1, platforms attract users with strong incentives and fair practices; in Stage 2, they begin favoring business customers; in Stage 3, they exploit users and merchants through manipulated algorithms, junk fees, and predatory pricing. Doctorow blames this decline on a lack of competition and weak regulation, proposing solutions such as antitrust enforcement, the abandonment of the consumer welfare standard, and increased interoperability. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, the theory has gained public attention and is supported by studies and advocacy, highlighting broader concerns about platform power and consumer rights.",
