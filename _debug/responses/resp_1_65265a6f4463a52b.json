  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the hidden realities of labor in Guatemalan maquila garment factories, revealing widespread exploitation, including long working hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats to union members. Despite Guatemala’s role as a key apparel supplier to US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren—especially due to post-pandemic nearshoring—workers face brutal conditions, with little legal protection. Korean-owned companies dominate the sector, and US brands benefit from supply chains that lack accountability. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Corina Olivares describe years of hardship, job insecurity, and even violence against union leaders, such as the murder of Anastacio Tzib Caal. The Guatemalan government struggles to enforce labor laws, and workers often lose pensions when factories close. Though President Bernardo Arévalo’s progressive administration has raised hopes for reform, systemic issues persist. The article underscores a gendered crisis in global supply chains, where women are disproportionately affected by exploitation and power imbalances.",
