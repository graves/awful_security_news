    "Despite these threats, recent data show increased calf births—four mother whales had calves this year, and some showed shorter reproductive intervals, suggesting improved reproductive health.",
    "Only 11 calves were born this year, below researchers’ hopes, but the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is a positive sign.",
    "New management measures in Canada, particularly in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, are critical to protecting the whales during their migration.",
    "Environmental groups warn that ongoing threats and potential weakening of marine protections (like the Marine Mammal Protection Act) could jeopardize recovery.",
    "Scientists emphasize that sustained annual population growth is essential for long-term survival, and that the species remains vulnerable to injury and underfeeding."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population, once on the brink of extinction due to whaling and modern threats like ship collisions and fishing gear, has shown a slow but encouraging recovery, with an estimated 384 individuals in 2025—up from 376 in 2024. Scientists at the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA report a 7% increase in population over four years, with notable signs of improved reproduction, including four mother whales having calves and shorter intervals between births. Despite this progress, the population remains vulnerable, with ongoing threats from entanglement and injury. Environmental groups like Oceana emphasize the need for stronger conservation, particularly the protection of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and targeted management in sensitive areas like the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The recovery is seen as fragile, and scientists stress that sustained annual growth is essential to ensure long-term survival.",
