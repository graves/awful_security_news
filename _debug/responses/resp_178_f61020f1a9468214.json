  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A landmark study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked the side effects of 30 commonly prescribed antidepressants based on data from over 58,500 patients, revealing significant differences in physical impacts such as weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure fluctuations. While SSRIs like sertraline and citalopram generally have fewer side effects, drugs like venlafaxine and amitriptyline carry notable risks for patients with pre-existing conditions. The findings show that even patients with the same diagnosis may benefit from different medications based on individual health profiles—such as weight concerns, hypertension, or high cholesterol. Experts emphasize that current prescribing in the UK heavily favors just three SSRIs, potentially at the cost of personalized care. The researchers urge a shift toward shared decision-making between patients and doctors, with plans to release a free online tool to support this. While the study assessed effects within the first eight weeks, experts note that long-term cumulative risks may be greater, especially in chronic depression. The results highlight the urgent need to personalize antidepressant prescriptions to improve patient safety and treatment adherence, not just for individuals but across millions of users.",
