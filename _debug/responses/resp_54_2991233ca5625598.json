  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is actively investigating the federal government’s response to protests in Chicago amid Operation Midway Blitz, a recent ICE-led enforcement campaign that resulted in over 1,000 arrests. During a hearing, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents on the ground to use body-worn cameras during protests, citing concerns about the use of force—such as tear gas and pepper balls—without warning, particularly in incidents involving Pastor Rev. David Black. While CBP agents have been issued cameras, ICE Special Response Teams have not and would require congressional approval to receive them. ICE officials testified that their agents are trained in crowd control and media interactions, and that all force incidents are reviewed internally. However, the federal leadership is described as a 'revolving door,' with key officials like Russell Hott departing the Chicago area, prompting Judge Ellis to continue questioning top officials to obtain firsthand accounts of events on the ground.",
