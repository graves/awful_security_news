She reflects on the June 2024 debate, where she first observed Biden’s health and noted the resulting political vulnerability. Jean-Pierre also highlights how she faced bias as a Black woman in her role, and emphasizes the loyalty and political power of Black women voters, whom she believes were overlooked. She frames her move to independence not as a political defection but as a call for accountability and a broader conversation about the future of American politics, urging citizens to engage actively and avoid silence that is complicit in political stagnation.",
