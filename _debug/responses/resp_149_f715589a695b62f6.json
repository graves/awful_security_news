  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China Eastern Airlines is resuming direct flights between Shanghai and Delhi starting November 9, 2025, after a five-year suspension. This development is part of a broader diplomatic thaw between India and China, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first visit to China in over seven years. The flight resumption—operating three times weekly—marks a significant step in restoring commercial and diplomatic ties, especially amid rising U.S. trade tensions and previous border violence in 2020. The move is also supported by India’s IndiGo and Chinese airport authorities, who have encouraged more direct routes. The diplomatic shift is seen as a strategic response to U.S. trade policies, including Trump’s proposed 50% tariff on Indian goods and 100% tariffs on China and India, which are shaping regional economic and security dynamics.",
