  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing wave of AI voice scams has targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, with fraudsters using artificial intelligence to generate realistic voice clones of public figures like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, falsely requesting money to rescue kidnapped journalists. The scam exploited the increasing realism of AI-generated voices—demonstrated in research by Queen Mary University of London—which found that AI voice clones are now perceived as equally real as human voices, and often more trustworthy. The fraud, which occurred just after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala, led to a financial loss of at least $1 million when former Inter Milan owner Massimo Moratti transferred money. Global deepfake scams have surged, with over $547 million lost between January and June 2025, and AI-generated content is now being used to create sexually explicit material, prompting legal and policy responses in the US and Australia. While AI voice technology offers positive applications like restoring speech for people who have lost their voice, the rise of deepfakes poses serious threats to personal identity, financial security, and public trust.",
