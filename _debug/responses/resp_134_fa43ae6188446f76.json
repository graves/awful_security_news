  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iran executed a person convicted of spying for Israel’s Mossad in Qom, after the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence and denied a pardon. The individual, whose identity was not disclosed, was accused of intelligence cooperation with Israel starting in October 2023 and arrested in February 2024. This execution follows a broader pattern of at least nine executions since May 2024, including the cases of Bahman Choobiasl and six others in Khuzestan Province, all linked to alleged Mossad activities. Iran frames these actions as necessary to protect national security amid what it calls Israeli infiltration and sabotage, especially following the '12-day war' and Israeli strikes on Iranian military sites. However, international bodies and human rights groups have criticized the process, citing coerced confessions and lack of fair trial access, raising concerns about the legitimacy and transparency of these judicial proceedings.",
