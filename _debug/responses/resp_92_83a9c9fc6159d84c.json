  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 19, 2025, over 7 million people participated in 'No Kings' protests across the United States, organized by groups like the Indivisible Project and 50501, in response to perceived authoritarianism under President Donald Trump. Protesters, including retirees, activists, and ordinary citizens from cities like Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, and Portland, rallied against executive overreach, immigration raids, the deployment of the National Guard, cuts to essential services like Medicaid, and attacks on free speech. While the demonstrations were largely peaceful, some incidents of violence occurred. Symbolically, the movement used yellow and festive costumes to emphasize unity and peaceful resistance, drawing on civil rights history and democratic ideals. Key speakers like Senator Bernie Sanders, Bill Nye, and Raphael Warnock amplified the message that the protests are not merely against one person, but against a system of political and economic corruption driven by billionaires. The scale and geographic spread of the protests reflect widespread public concern about the health of American democracy.",
