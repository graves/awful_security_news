  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, citing that these systems provide highly distorted and polarized political advice. Tests revealed that the AI models frequently recommended extreme parties—such as the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) and the left-wing Green Left-Labour Party—while rarely suggesting centrist parties like Democrats 66 or the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of democratic elections, as voters may be misled into supporting parties that do not align with their actual values. The authority urges citizens not to rely on AI for voting guidance due to its lack of transparency and verifiability, and calls on chatbot providers to prevent their platforms from being used as political voting tools. This warning comes as the Netherlands prepares for its parliamentary elections on October 29, amid political tension over the PVV's strong showing and its inability to secure a majority despite leading opinion polls.",
