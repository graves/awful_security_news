  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Leader, argues that public pressure will force Congress to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025, to prevent millions of Americans from facing unaffordable premium hikes — potentially increasing monthly costs by up to $2,000, and reaching over $24,000 annually. With over 20 million people relying on ACA subsidies, Jeffries warns that without action, people will lose access to health insurance, especially in states like Georgia, Virginia, and Maryland. He opposes Republican proposals for a one-year extension, citing them as insufficient and politically biased, pointing to tax breaks for billionaires and cuts to Medicaid as evidence of a policy that disproportionately harms working-class Americans. In contrast, Jeffries supports full federal worker payments and criticizes Republican legislation that grants the President discretion over who gets paid, calling it lawless and politically motivated. As the open enrollment period begins, public awareness of the cost increases will grow, intensifying pressure on Congress to act decisively and comprehensively to preserve access to affordable health care.",
