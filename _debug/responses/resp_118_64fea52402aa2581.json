    "New Jersey is experiencing a closely contested gubernatorial race between Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.",
    "The race is notable for its personal attacks, including claims from Sherrill that Ciattarelli's business downplayed opioid dangers and caused mass deaths, and Ciattarelli's claim that Sherrill was barred from walking at her naval academy graduation due to a cheating scandal.",
    "Both candidates are making affordability and cost of living a central issue, with rising utility costs—up to 20% in June—being highlighted as a key voter concern.",
    "President Donald Trump has endorsed Ciattarelli, despite previously calling him a 'charlatan and an embarrassment' in 2016, adding significant national political weight to the race.",
    "Former President Barack Obama endorsed Mikie Sherrill, calling her the 'right choice' to lead New Jersey, signaling broader Democratic support and national attention.",
    "New Jersey has a history of electing governors from both parties, despite being a blue state in presidential and Senate races, making this race a significant indicator of political shifts.",
    "If Mikie Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms.",
    "Ciattarelli's campaign has threatened legal action against Sherrill for defamation over claims of mass opioid-related deaths, which may impact the discourse and public perception."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A closely contested gubernatorial race is unfolding in New Jersey, where Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are competing in a traditionally blue state that has historically elected governors from both parties. The race has intensified with personal attacks, including claims from Sherrill that Ciattarelli's company downplayed opioid dangers and caused mass deaths, and Ciattarelli's claim that Sherrill was barred from walking at her naval academy graduation due to a cheating scandal. National figures such as former President Barack Obama and Donald Trump are deeply involved, with Obama endorsing Sherrill and Trump endorsing Ciattarelli despite past criticism. Both candidates highlight affordability and rising utility costs as central voter concerns, with recent increases in electricity bills by up to 20% adding urgency. Experts like Ben Dworkin note that while Democrats have a voter registration advantage, the state's purple gubernatorial history suggests a potential for a close election. If Sherrill wins, it would mark the first time since the 1960s that a governor has served three consecutive terms from the same party.",
