  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from illegal ranches operating within protected areas of Pará. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from deforested land to be 'laundered' through a system of transit permits (GTA) that only records group-level data. This lack of individual traceability means JBS cannot verify whether its beef or leather products come from illegal operations. The report documents encroachments in two protected zones—Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa—where state agency Adepará authorized cattle transport without environmental oversight. Experts and advocacy groups, including Greenpeace Brazil, criticize JBS for failing to meet its 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement commitments and urge immediate, mandatory federal traceability systems to end deforestation. Although Pará’s governor and Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture have introduced tracking mandates by 2026 and 2032 respectively, these timelines are deemed too slow. The article underscores the urgent need for transparency, enforcement, and accountability in global supply chains to protect the Amazon and its vulnerable communities.",
