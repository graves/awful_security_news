    "Legal experts note that such claims of selective prosecution may be more likely to be considered by judges given the public history of Trump’s attacks on individuals targeted by the Justice Department."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Comey, the former FBI director, has initiated a legal defense strategy to have federal charges brought against him for allegedly lying during congressional testimony dismissed, claiming the prosecution is a result of personal retaliation by President Donald Trump and that the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, was improperly appointed. His legal team argues that Trump's public attacks on Comey and the bypassing of Senate confirmation for Halligan's appointment violate constitutional provisions, including the Appointments Clause. They cite prior judicial rulings involving similar unlawful appointments, such as in the Trump Florida case involving Jack Smith, to support their claim. The case highlights broader concerns about political retaliation and executive overreach in the justice system.",
