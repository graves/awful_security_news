Ingrassia has been linked to White nationalist Nick Fuentes, and his past promotion of conspiracy theories, anti-Israel rhetoric, and calls for martial law following the 2020 election have intensified scrutiny. While his legal team denies the authenticity of the texts, calling them satirical or manipulated, the controversy reflects broader concerns about ethical standards, diversity, and integrity in federal appointments. The White House has not commented, and confirmation remains pending after a scheduled hearing on Thursday.",
