In response, Maduro has mobilized vast military forces, claiming over 8 million militia members and conducting drills across 20 of Venezuela’s 23 states under 'Independence 200'. While the U.S. claims its actions are aimed at combating drug trafficking and protecting national security, experts and military officials have raised serious legal and ethical concerns over the scope and legality of these operations. Internal dissent is growing within the Pentagon, including the retirement of SOUTHCOM Admiral Alvin Holsey, and the detention of survivors from a recent strike, raising new legal questions. In Venezuela, civilians are growing anxious, with widespread fear of attack and signs of public protest, highlighting the human cost of this geopolitical standoff.",
