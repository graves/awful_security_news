  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range weapon with a range of up to 2,500 km, remains a key tool in U.S. military operations globally. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly advocated for the delivery of Tomahawks to enable Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia, targeting critical infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base. However, the United States has limited stockpiles due to domestic defense needs, with President Donald Trump stating that Tomahawks are needed for U.S. security. Russia has reacted with alarm, viewing the supply as a hostile act that could threaten global stability, with SVR head Sergey Naryshkin warning of escalation risks. Ukraine lacks a ground-based launcher like the Typhon to use Tomahawks effectively, and its own domestic cruise missile, the Flamingo, is not yet capable or scalable. While Tomahawks could significantly enhance Ukraine’s long-range strike capability, the current geopolitical and logistical constraints mean such delivery is not feasible. Instead, Ukraine’s immediate military priority remains strengthening its air defense systems against Russian drone and missile attacks.",
