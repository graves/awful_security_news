  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iran has declared that the nuclear restrictions imposed under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) have officially terminated, marking the end of a 10-year agreement. Despite Iran’s claim of continued commitment to diplomacy, the deal effectively collapsed due to the United States’ 2018 unilateral withdrawal, followed by the UK, Germany, and France triggering the 'snapback' mechanism in August 2024, which re-imposed UN sanctions and formally ended negotiations. The US-Israeli military campaign in June 2024, which targeted Iranian nuclear sites and killed over 1,000 civilians, further eroded trust and led Iran to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Neither US intelligence nor the IAEA has found evidence of Iran pursuing nuclear weapons, though concerns remain. Iran remains skeptical of talks with the US, citing past political hostility, while European powers now seek to restart negotiations. Experts argue that the termination of the JCPOA is largely symbolic, as its practical end was sealed by the snapback process, and the agreement remains politically and strategically inactive.",
