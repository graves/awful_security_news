  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a survivor of a US military strike on a semi-submersible submarine allegedly carrying fentanyl and other drugs in the Caribbean. The US claims the vessel was a 'drug-carrying submarine' built for narcotics transport, targeting 'narco-terrorists' linked to Venezuelan drug cartels, particularly those under Nicolás Maduro. The two survivors—Tufiño from Ecuador and Jeison Obando Pérez from Colombia—are the first known to have survived such an attack, with the Colombian survivor suffering critical injuries. Ecuador refused to detain Tufiño due to lack of legal evidence of a crime, while Colombia criticized the US for allegedly violating its territorial waters. The US has deployed over 10,000 troops and various military assets to the region, conducting at least seven strikes since September, killing at least 32 people. Experts and officials question the legality and origin of the drug supply, particularly fentanyl’s entry into the US via Caribbean routes, which is mostly traced to Mexico. Diplomatic tensions have escalated, with Colombian President Gustavo Petro accusing the US of illegal action and Trump retaliating by attacking Petro's drug policies and threatening aid withdrawal. Trinidad and Tobago has publicly supported the US military actions, citing regional stability as a goal.",
