  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have denied any plans for a near-future summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, following initial announcements. The delay stems from a fundamental disagreement over ceasefire conditions: Russia demands control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and dismantling of Ukrainian military capabilities, while Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy advocate for a temporary freeze of current battle lines. A private Russian communique and a phone call between US and Russian foreign ministers failed to resolve the impasse, leading both sides to dismiss further in-person meetings as unnecessary. Ukraine and European leaders have criticized Russia’s 'maximalist' stance and continued violence, asserting that only Ukraine is committed to peace. The situation underscores the deepening diplomatic rift between the US and Russia over the path to a sustainable ceasefire in Ukraine.",
