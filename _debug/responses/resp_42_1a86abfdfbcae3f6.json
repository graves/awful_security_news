  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, as part of a $200 million project to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which will seat 650 people and feature gold finishes, crystal chandeliers, and gilded architecture. The initiative, long championed by President Donald Trump, aims to fulfill a 15-year ambition to expand the White House’s entertaining capacity and reflect his personal style, including elements reminiscent of his private clubs. The project has sparked controversy, with critics calling it excessive, prompting White House officials to invoke past renovations during the Truman administration as precedent. The ballroom will be built adjacent to the existing structure, not replacing it, and will maintain architectural harmony with the neoclassical design of the White House, though it will be funded by private donors and Trump himself.",
