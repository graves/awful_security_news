  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown beginning October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal workers are unpaid or furloughed, while lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, judges, political appointees, and certain essential employees—including military personnel and DHS law enforcement—continue to receive pay. The Trump administration has used $8 billion in Pentagon funds to cover military paychecks and has directed payments to FBI agents and 70,000 DHS personnel. However, the White House is questioning whether the 2019 back pay law applies to furloughed employees, and many federal contractors face no compensation. Federal workers, particularly those living paycheck to paycheck, face severe financial hardship, with reports of families at risk of losing homes or food. Senate staff and judicial branch employees are also affected, with no pay for the remainder of the shutdown. The situation underscores deep disparities in who benefits from the shutdown and who bears the full financial burden.",
