  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal workers are affected, with roughly 730,000 unpaid and 670,000 furloughed. Lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, federal judges, and certain essential personnel such as FBI agents and DHS law enforcement are being paid due to constitutional provisions or funding from non-annual appropriations like the Inflation Reduction Act or Pentagon R&D funds. President Donald Trump has taken steps to protect key federal workers, including using $8 billion in Pentagon funds to cover the military's October 15 payroll and ensuring payments to specific law enforcement personnel. However, Senate staff and many other employees are not receiving pay, and there is growing debate over whether furloughed workers are entitled to back pay under a 2019 law. Federal contractors have no such guarantee, and the financial toll on workers—many of whom live paycheck to paycheck—is severe, risking loss of homes, vehicles, and food for families.",
