  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on October 20, 2025, began at 07:11 GMT in AWS’s Virginia data center due to a technical error in a DynamoDB API update that disrupted the Domain Name System (DNS), preventing apps from finding server addresses. This led to the failure of 113 AWS services, including Snapchat, Pinterest, WhatsApp, Roblox, Fortnite, Delta Airlines, Venmo, and major news outlets like The New York Times. The incident, which lasted until 10:11 GMT, revealed how deeply modern digital services—ranging from banking and gaming to smart home devices and media—depend on cloud infrastructure. Experts confirmed the issue was human error, not a cyberattack, and AWS quickly restored services, though some users faced message backlogs. The event underscores the fragility of internet-dependent systems and the critical role of robust cloud management in maintaining global digital operations.",
