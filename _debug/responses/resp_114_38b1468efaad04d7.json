  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI's new AI video tool, Sora 2, has sparked significant controversy after users created unauthorized, often disrespectful, AI-generated videos of real people—such as Martin Luther King Jr., Robin Williams, and Tupac Shakur—performing actions they never did. These videos, which include fictional or inappropriate content like shoplifting or delivering altered speeches, have drawn strong backlash from artists, performers, and unions like SAG-AFTRA. Talent agencies and unions argue that such content constitutes exploitation, violating intellectual property rights and personal dignity. In response, OpenAI has introduced an 'opt-in' policy allowing individuals to control whether their likeness is used, and has agreed to remove existing harmful content. Industry stakeholders, including California’s governor Gavin Newsom and the Motion Picture Association, are now advocating for federal legislation—the 'NO FAKES Act'—to require explicit consent before digital replicas of people can be created, signaling a major shift in how AI technology is regulated in entertainment.",
