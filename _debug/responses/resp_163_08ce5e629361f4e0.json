  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A $1.7 billion funding shortfall threatens the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), which includes the World Health Organization and the Gates Foundation. The shortfall, driven by reduced foreign aid from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, will result in a 30% budget reduction starting in 2026 and a critical gap through 2029. The GPEI is responding by focusing resources on high-risk regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where wild polio cases are reported, and adopting cost-saving strategies such as fractional dosing. While vaccine-derived polio has been recorded in Nigeria and other countries, global health officials emphasize that sustained vaccination and surveillance are essential to achieve eradication. Despite the funding crisis, experts maintain that eradication remains feasible with continued international cooperation.",
