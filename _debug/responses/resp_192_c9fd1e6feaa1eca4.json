  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage on October 21, 2025, disrupted key UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global debate over the risks of over-reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. Despite the benefits of using dominant cloud providers—such as cost efficiency and scalability—experts warn that the concentration of market power creates systemic vulnerabilities due to 'nested dependencies' and poor resilience. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has flagged market concentration as a serious issue and recommended designating AWS and Azure as having 'strategic market status' to enforce competition. Experts argue that achieving true digital sovereignty requires policy-driven measures, including mandatory use of multiple cloud providers and data replication strategies, to ensure national resilience and allow innovation from smaller, domestic providers. The UK government, including Lord Leong, has acknowledged the issue and is working to diversify the cloud ecosystem and strengthen digital infrastructure through collaboration with AWS and support for European and UK-based providers.",
