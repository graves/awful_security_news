  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—passed down through generations—is proving more effective than government-installed early warning systems in detecting and preventing glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite a $37 million investment in technology-based systems like the GLOF-II project, local communities have lost trust due to frequent failures, lack of maintenance, and poor communication. Shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain rely on traditional signs—such as unusual rainfall, animal behavior, and sound patterns—to alert villagers, often saving entire communities. The government acknowledges the severity of the crisis, with the climate change minister highlighting high mortality and displacement. However, the failure of official systems has led to public outcry, with no official investigation into the shortcomings. As climate change accelerates glacier melt and precipitation patterns shift, Indigenous knowledge systems remain a vital, trusted, and resilient alternative to failing technology-based warnings.",
