  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi experienced the world’s most polluted air, with PM2.5 levels exceeding 40 times the World Health Organization’s safety guidelines. The spike is attributed to widespread use of firecrackers — including non-compliant and banned types — despite a 2020 ban and a 2025 Supreme Court permit for 'green' firecrackers. Poor enforcement and continued stubble burning in surrounding regions have exacerbated the pollution. Residents report severe health impacts, and long-term pollution control efforts like traffic restrictions and smog towers have failed due to lack of enforcement. India’s economic needs and cultural traditions have made sustainable pollution solutions difficult to implement, with multiple major cities, including Kolkata and Mumbai, also among the world’s most polluted.",
