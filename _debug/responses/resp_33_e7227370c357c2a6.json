  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under a fragile ceasefire. With 18 hostages still missing in Gaza, Israel expresses frustration over Hamas's inability to return all bodies, accusing the group of withholding information and using missing remains as leverage. Despite Hamas claiming to have handed over all accessible remains, Israeli intelligence believes some bodies may still be hidden. Meanwhile, the ceasefire faces strain from Israeli strikes that killed civilians, including a family of 11 who crossed a ceasefire line, and from the continued closure of the Rafah border crossing, which severely limits humanitarian aid. Negotiations on Phase Two—covering demilitarization, Palestinian governance, and the formation of an International Stabilization Force (ISF)—are underway in Egypt, with a U.S.-led 20-point plan proposing a technocratic Palestinian government and a Trump-led Board of Peace. However, Hamas remains vague on disarmament, and international participation in the ISF is still being negotiated, including demands for UN Security Council approval.",
