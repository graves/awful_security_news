  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s national security adviser since 2023, has been dismissed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid growing tensions over Israel’s military strategy in Gaza, particularly Hanegbi’s opposition to a full military takeover of Gaza City and his support for a partial deal with Hamas. Hanegbi admitted responsibility for the failures leading up to the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, and called for a thorough investigation, which has not yet been formally established under Netanyahu’s government. In response, Gil Reich, the deputy head of the National Security Council, has been appointed as acting head of the council. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who argue it reflects a broader pattern of avoiding accountability and replacing critical voices with loyalists. This leadership shift reflects deepening internal divisions within Israel’s security apparatus and raises concerns about transparency and responsibility in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack.",
