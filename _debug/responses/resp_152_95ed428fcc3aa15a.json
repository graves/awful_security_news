  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 21, 2025, hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters clashed violently with police in southwest Dublin, near the Citywest Hotel in Saggart, following allegations that a 26-year-old asylum seeker sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl who was under state care. The man, who requested a Romanian interpreter in court, was charged, though his ethnicity remains unconfirmed. Protesters launched fireworks, carried signs reading 'Irish lives matter,' and chanted 'Get them out!' A police van was set on fire during the confrontation. Irish Justice Minister Jim O’Callaghan condemned the weaponization of the crime, while Prime Minister Michael Martin described the events as 'extremely serious and very, very grave.' This incident follows a pattern of rising anti-immigrant sentiment in Ireland, echoed by similar unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, in June 2025, after the arrest of two Romanian boys on suspicion of assaulting a teenage girl. Such events illustrate how allegations involving vulnerable children and asylum seekers are being exploited to fuel xenophobic protests and public disorder.",
