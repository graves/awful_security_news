  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tech CEOs from major companies including Anthropic, Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are promoting AI's ability to write vast portions of code, claiming a new era of automation. However, many software engineers remain skeptical, citing poor code quality, unmanageable AI agent behaviors, and lack of real productivity gains. Studies show mixed results — some engineers report modest time savings, while others find AI actually slows them down. Experts emphasize that AI is best suited for simple, low-accuracy tasks like prototyping, and that high-level problem solving still requires human judgment. There is growing concern about job displacement, environmental costs, and cultural pressures to use AI regardless of need, which leads to inefficient or unusable code. The article concludes that while AI has changed coding workflows, it is not replacing human engineers and remains a tool that must be used with caution, expertise, and oversight.",
