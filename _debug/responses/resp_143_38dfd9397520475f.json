    "Climate change is increasing dangerous 'superhot days' — defined as days warmer than 90% of comparable days from 1991–2020 — by 57 per year by 2100 under current emission commitments.",
    "Before the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming was on track for 4°C (7.2°F), which would have led to 114 extra superhot days annually; now, with 2.6°C warming, the increase is reduced to 57, but still significant.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days per year.",
    "The impact of climate change is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face dramatically more extra superhot days — with Panama projected at 149 per year — despite producing less than 1% of global heat-trapping emissions.",
    "Top carbon emitters such as the United States, China, and India — responsible for 42% of global CO2 — face only 23–30 extra superhot days, highlighting a major climate injustice.",
    "Experts warn that this heat inequality could deepen global inequalities and contribute to geopolitical instability, especially as vulnerable nations suffer disproportionately.",
    "Experts such as Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto emphasize that even the current climate trajectory still poses a disastrous future for billions, with tens of thousands or millions of people at risk from heat-related deaths."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central estimates that due to climate change, the Earth will experience an additional 57 superhot days annually by 2100 under current emissions commitments, half of what would have occurred under a pre-Paris warming scenario of 4°C. The report shows that the Paris Climate Agreement has reduced the worst-case warming trajectory, but the world is still facing significant and dangerous heat increases. Notably, small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face the largest spikes in superhot days — with Panama projected at 149 extra days annually — despite contributing less than 1% of global emissions. In contrast, the world’s top carbon emitters — the U.S., China, and India — face only 23–30 extra days, revealing a stark and unjust climate disparity. Experts warn that this inequality may deepen global divisions and threaten geopolitical stability, while also stressing that tens of thousands or millions of people will face deadly heat-related risks annually.",
