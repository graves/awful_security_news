  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, London police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, in 2011, asked a bodyguard to investigate Virginia Giuffre’s criminal record in an attempt to discredit her as a sexual assault accuser. The allegations come amid renewed scrutiny of Andrew’s long-standing ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his failure to show empathy for victims. Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001 and died by suicide in April 2025, is central to the case. Although Andrew settled a civil suit with her in 2022 without admitting wrongdoing, he continues to deny all allegations. The investigation raises serious ethical concerns about the use of law enforcement personnel in smear campaigns. British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband condemned such actions as deeply inappropriate, and Giuffre’s family has urged King Charles III to strip Andrew of his royal titles, signaling a broader call for accountability within the House of Windsor.",
