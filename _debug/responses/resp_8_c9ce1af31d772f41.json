  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has officially ended its 50+ year partnership with China by sending back three giant pandas — Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — marking the conclusion of a historic program initiated in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit to China. This program, known as 'panda diplomacy,' was used to strengthen U.S.-China relations and promote global conservation. China owns all pandas and charges U.S. zoos for conservation efforts, with the National Zoo having paid $500,000 annually and Zoo Atlanta over $16 million. However, rising geopolitical tensions, public controversy over panda treatment in the Memphis Zoo, and China’s shifting diplomatic priorities have led to the program's end. With only Mexico City’s Xin Xin remaining in the Americas, the U.S. is now the only major country without pandas. The National Zoo is preparing for the future, with hopes that China might resume sending pandas, though no official decisions have been made. The decline in panda programs in the U.S. and other nations reflects a broader shift in China’s international outreach, now favoring countries like Russia and Qatar over the United States.",
