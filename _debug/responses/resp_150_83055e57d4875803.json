  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, citing that these tools offer 'highly distorted and polarized' political advice. Tests conducted on four major AI models revealed that they frequently recommended extremist parties—such as the right-wing Party for Freedom (PVV) and the left-wing Green Left-Labour Party—while largely ignoring centrist parties like Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The authority emphasizes that such AI recommendations are not transparent, verifiable, or reliable, and warns that voters may be misled into supporting parties that do not reflect their actual preferences. This comes amid political instability in the Netherlands, where the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, has pulled out of coalition talks over immigration policy, increasing public scrutiny on how information is being processed during the upcoming October 29 election.",
