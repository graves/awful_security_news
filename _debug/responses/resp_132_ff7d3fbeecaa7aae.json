  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports on a deepening government shutdown in the United States, now in its fourth week and the longest in history, as President Donald Trump and Republican leaders refuse to compromise on health care funding. The shutdown has led to widespread furloughs, including at the National Nuclear Security Administration and federal agencies like the FAA, and threatens essential services like Head Start and WIC. Meanwhile, the expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies by December 31, 2025, is expected to drive sharp increases in health care costs, causing public anxiety. Despite Democratic outreach to Trump for negotiations, Republicans maintain that the government must reopen before any discussions on health care occur. Economists warn of significant economic losses, and the situation underscores a growing crisis in both public service delivery and national economic stability.",
