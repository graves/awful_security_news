    "Trump has emphasized that the ballroom is a long-desired feature, dating back 150 years, and that it will not interfere with the main structure of the White House, while also rejecting hosting foreign dignitaries in pavilions on the South Lawn."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing, a historically significant wing housing the First Lady’s offices, to build a $250 million ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency overseeing such projects. The project, initiated by President Donald Trump, claims to be privately funded and cost-free to taxpayers, with no formal disclosure of donors. Although White House officials assert that the main structure will not be damaged and that offices will be temporarily relocated, dramatic photos show visible demolition of building elements. The new ballroom, designed to hold up to 999 people, is described as the largest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the Truman Balcony in 1948. Carrier Global Corp. has donated an HVAC system, and the project is scheduled for completion by January 2029. The lack of oversight, combined with the timing of construction during a government shutdown and contradictory claims about demolition, raises serious concerns about transparency, legal compliance, and the long-term impact on the White House’s historic integrity.",
