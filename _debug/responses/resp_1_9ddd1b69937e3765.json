  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. is releasing two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, under President Donald Trump. The strike, the sixth in the region since September 2025, targeted a vessel believed to carry narcotics and was justified by the administration as a response to 'narco-terrorists.' The survivors, initially held by U.S. military forces, are now being transferred for prosecution in their respective countries. This marks the first time the Trump administration has detained individuals after such a strike, raising significant legal and constitutional questions, particularly regarding the absence of congressional authorization and due process rights. The operation is framed as part of a broader effort to curb drug flows into the U.S. and pressure Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, though experts question the legality of using military force against drug traffickers, especially given the traditional role of agencies like the Coast Guard in such matters.",
