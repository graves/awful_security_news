  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest have been shelved after a White House official confirmed there are no such plans in the immediate future. The proposed meeting, which was initially announced by Trump following a phone call with Putin, was replaced by a productive call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, making a physical meeting unnecessary. Trump previously engaged in tense talks with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, during which he reportedly pushed for territorial concessions, but later reversed course to support a ceasefire that freezes the current front line. Russia, however, rejects this freeze, insisting on long-term peace through maximalist demands such as recognizing Russian sovereignty over Donbas and demilitarizing Ukraine. Zelensky argues that only discussions about supplying long-range weapons to Ukraine—such as US Tomahawk missiles—can compel Russia to enter meaningful diplomacy. The mention of Tomahawk missiles is highlighted as the key catalyst for Russian engagement, signaling a significant escalation in military and diplomatic tension between the US, Russia, and Ukraine.",
