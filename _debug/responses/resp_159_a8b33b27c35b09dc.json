While no country has committed to direct combat, Trump reiterated his threat of a 'fast, furious, and brutal' end to Hamas, drawing criticism for escalating tensions. Meanwhile, Israel has continued to restrict humanitarian aid to Gaza—only allowing 986 aid trucks since the ceasefire began—raising serious humanitarian concerns. The U.S. Vice President, JD Vance, emphasized the need for a long-term security infrastructure and humanitarian aid, and announced the opening of the Civilian Military Co-operation Centre (CMCC) in Israel to facilitate aid and reconstruction. Despite these efforts, deep divisions remain over Hamas disarmament, the status of missing civilians, and the legitimacy of Israel’s military actions, which some international bodies have accused of genocide.",
