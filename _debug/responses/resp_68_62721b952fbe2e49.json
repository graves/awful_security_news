    "Americans show little enthusiasm for President Donald Trump's handling of the Gaza ceasefire deal, despite its international recognition as a major diplomatic achievement.",

    "Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC show that Americans remain largely disapproving of Trump's Gaza handling, with approval on that issue only marginally increased (37% to 47%) and overall approval at a two-term low (37% approve, 61% disapprove).",
    "The perception that international peace deals are fragile—like the Biden administration’s ceasefire that lasted only two months—fuels skepticism among Americans about Trump’s Gaza deal.",
    "A significant drop in confidence in the economy is reflected in public sentiment: only 32% expect economic improvement and 31% expect wage increases over the next year, and job insecurity has increased among employed Americans."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, which some saw as a diplomatic triumph and even a potential path to a Nobel Peace Prize, American public sentiment remains largely negative toward President Donald Trump. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC shows that while Trump’s approval on the Gaza issue slightly improved, overall approval is at a low point, with widespread disapproval on economic issues such as inflation, cost of living, and job security. Americans appear to prioritize domestic economic concerns over foreign policy achievements, and skepticism about the durability of peace agreements—such as the short-lived Biden-era ceasefire—further undermines trust in Trump’s Gaza deal. The article concludes that the real driver of public opinion is not foreign policy success, but the economy, especially as inflation remains high and job insecurity grows.",
