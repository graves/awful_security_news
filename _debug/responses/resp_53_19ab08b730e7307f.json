  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A North Korean submunition, marked with Juche calendar references indicating a 2000 production date, was found in a drone used to attack the Ukrainian port city of Kherson in September 2024. The submunition, originally designed for rocket artillery, was repurposed for a first-person-view drone using basic materials. The discovery, reported by Conflict Armament Research (CAR), establishes a direct material link between North Korea and Russia’s war in Ukraine. This occurs amid Russia’s large-scale drone attacks and production, and North Korea’s increased military involvement, including the deployment of approximately 12,000 troops to Russia, with around 4,000 reported casualties. The findings signal a growing level of international military cooperation in the war, raising concerns about the global spread of asymmetric warfare tactics.",
