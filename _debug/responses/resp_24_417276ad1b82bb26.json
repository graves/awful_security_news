  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, forming in the Caribbean Sea, is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, with significant impacts anticipated for the northern Caribbean, especially Hispaniola, where heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the East Coast and Florida may face rough seas and rain. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the season and the first to form in the Caribbean, fueled by unusually warm sea temperatures linked to climate change. The storm’s track remains uncertain, with two main scenarios: one turning north toward Hispaniola and another moving west toward Central America. Recent trends of rapid intensification in storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto highlight growing concerns about climate-related storm behavior.",
