  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A British woman, Lindsay Sandiford, aged 68, was sentenced to death by firing squad in Indonesia in 2013 after being arrested in 2012 with 3.8 kilograms of cocaine hidden in her suitcase. She claimed she was coerced into carrying the drugs to protect her children. The sentence was upheld by Indonesia’s highest court. A separate British prisoner, Shahab Shahabadi, has been serving a life sentence since 2014 for methamphetamine trafficking. Both are now being repatriated under a bilateral agreement signed on October 21, 2025, between the UK and Indonesia. The UK Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, and Indonesia’s Senior Minister of Law, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, signed the deal, citing health concerns and humanitarian grounds. The repatriation reflects broader international efforts to prevent capital punishment for foreign nationals, especially in countries with strict drug laws like Indonesia, which has nearly 100 foreigners on death row and has not executed anyone since 2016. This case highlights tensions between strict drug enforcement and human rights protections in global drug trafficking enforcement.",
