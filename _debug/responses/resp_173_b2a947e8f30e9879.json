    "A planned Trump-Putin meeting in Budapest has been officially shelved by the White House, with no immediate plans for future talks.",
    "The cancellation follows a failed preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, which the White House claims was 'productive' and rendered a meeting unnecessary.",
    "Trump previously discussed a summit with Putin, allegedly in a 'shouting match' involving demands to cede Donbas territory in Ukraine, which Zelensky rejected as untenable.",
    "Trump instead endorsed a ceasefire proposal to freeze the conflict at the current battle line, aligning with Kyiv and European leaders.",
    "Russia, through Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, has consistently rejected freezing the front line, insisting on complete Ukrainian troop withdrawal from Donbas and full Russian sovereignty over the region.",
    "European leaders accused Russia of lack of seriousness about peace, emphasizing that a frozen front line is a necessary first step in diplomacy.",
    "Zelensky noted that the only topic that could make Moscow engage was the potential supply of long-range weapons (e.g., Tomahawk missiles) to Ukraine, which prompted Russia's diplomatic response.",
    "The Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska in August yielded no results, and the current cancellation may be an effort to avoid repeating that failure."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has officially shelved plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, citing a 'productive' call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as rendering a meeting unnecessary. The decision follows a series of escalating disagreements over Ukraine's front line, with Trump proposing a ceasefire at the current battle line and Zelensky opposing territorial concessions in Donbas. Russia, through Lavrov and Peskov, has consistently rejected such a freeze, demanding full withdrawal of Ukrainian forces and recognition of Russian sovereignty over Donbas. The only issue that prompted Russian engagement—U.S. consideration of sending long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine—was seen as a breakthrough by Ukrainian officials, though it did not lead to a lasting agreement. The cancellation reflects broader concerns that maximalist Russian demands and lack of mutual compromise make a successful peace deal unlikely, echoing the failure of the 2024 Alaska summit.",
