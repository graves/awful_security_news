    "The GOP, led by Donald Trump and allies, has amplified rhetoric claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorist sympathizers, and terrorists, despite judicial rulings and data showing left-wing violence is not significantly greater than decades of right-wing violence.",
    "This rhetoric mirrors past Republican criticism of Trump supporters being labeled 'basket of deplorables' and reflects a strategic shift from condemning broad generalizations to embracing them.",
    "Evidence from June rallies shows the events were peaceful, with only a few isolated incidents, including alleged attacks on protesters and a deadly shooting by a peacekeeper, which are not representative of the overall turnout.",
    "Democratic officials, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Ruben Gallego, have warned that such rhetoric could justify militarization and political crackdowns, and that the public is increasingly skeptical of claims of left-wing extremism.",
    "Public opinion polls (Marquette University Law School and CBS News-YouGov) indicate Americans are split on whether left- or right-wing violence is greater, and more Americans see the Republican Party as extreme than the Democratic Party.",
    "The GOP's claims are seen as strategically suspect, potentially enabling increased control over the political left through the justification of violence and militarization."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The GOP, led by Donald Trump and allies, has escalated its rhetoric claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorist sympathizers, and terrorists, despite judicial rulings and data showing left-wing violence is not significantly greater than right-wing violence. This rhetoric, previously criticized by Republicans themselves, now includes extreme statements from top officials like White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and others, who describe the Democratic base as consisting of Hamas supporters and violent criminals. Evidence from earlier June rallies shows the events were largely peaceful, with only isolated incidents, such as alleged attacks on protesters and a deadly shooting by a peacekeeper. Democratic leaders have warned that such rhetoric could justify militarization and political crackdowns, and public opinion polls indicate Americans are split on the relative levels of left- and right-wing violence. The article concludes that the GOP’s claims are strategically suspect and may serve to expand presidential power through the justification of violence and political control.",
