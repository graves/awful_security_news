  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House began demolishing part of the East Wing in October 2025 to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which regulates major renovations to federal buildings. President Donald Trump announced the project, claiming it would not interfere with the main structure and would be privately funded by donors and himself, with Carrier Global Corp. donating HVAC systems. The East Wing, built in 1902 and housing the First Lady’s offices, will be temporarily relocated, and construction is expected to be completed by January 2029. The project has drawn criticism for bypassing federal oversight, altering a historic section of the White House, and lacking transparency on funding sources, even as Trump insists it is a long-desired, patriotic enhancement to the presidential residence.",
