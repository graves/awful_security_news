  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, disrupting millions of online services including banking, shopping, and social media. The outage stemmed from a failure in Amazon’s Domain Name System (DNS), preventing users from accessing data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB and EC2 services. Although the root cause remains unclear, experts attribute the issue to a technical fault, not a cyberattack. This event highlights the fragility of the internet’s infrastructure, which is overly reliant on a few major cloud providers like AWS. Historically, such outages are rare, with the last major one occurring in 2021, but their impact is magnified due to the widespread dependence on cloud computing. The incident underscores the need for greater redundancy and diversity in digital infrastructure to prevent cascading failures.",
