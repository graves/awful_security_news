  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A daring daylight heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris involved four masked thieves who used a truck with a mechanical lift and power tools to breach the Galerie d'Apollon within less than eight minutes. The thieves stole high-value jewellery, including a diamond and emerald necklace from Emperor Napoleon and a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie. Experts estimate the stolen items are worth €88 million, with the greater loss being to France’s cultural heritage. Security failures, including missing CCTV in one-third of rooms and a non-activated alarm system, were identified. A damaged crown was found on the escape route, and investigators believe the thieves have likely melted the items into precious metals and smuggled them abroad for resale. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have condemned the attack, calling it a serious threat to national heritage and security. With less than two days remaining to recover the items, experts warn they may already be lost for good.",
