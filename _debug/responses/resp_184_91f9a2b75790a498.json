    "The 'yellow line' in Gaza, established as part of Donald Trump's peace plan, marks Israel's withdrawal to approximately 53% control of the Gaza Strip and is being seen by some as a temporary but potentially permanent border.",
    "Netanyahu's coalition partners, especially far-right figures, support the yellow line as a potential de facto border enabling settlement expansion and annexation of Gaza, which aligns with their political and ideological goals.",
    "The US, particularly through Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is pushing for restraint, emphasizing that Hamas violations must not trigger escalation or undermine the ceasefire.",
    "Israel’s response to a Hamas attack inside the yellow line involved limited air strikes and a return to the truce, signaling a deliberate effort to avoid breaking the agreement and maintain alignment with US expectations.",
    "Netanyahu maintains that the war will not end until Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is fully demilitarized, but growing Israeli commentary suggests that US influence is increasingly shaping military decisions.",
    "The second stage of the peace plan hinges on resolving key issues like power transfer in Gaza and Hamas disarmament, making it a critical juncture where US and domestic political interests may clash.",
    "The yellow line represents a strategic balancing act: it gives Netanyahu room for maneuver, but also exposes tensions between his domestic far-right allies and his international allies in Washington."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the strategic significance of the 'yellow line' in Gaza, a temporary military boundary established as the first stage of Donald Trump’s peace plan, which sees Israel retain control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip. This line, described by an Israeli newspaper as 'effectively the new border,' satisfies far-right coalition allies who hope it will become a permanent demarcation allowing for settlement expansion. However, it creates tension between Netanyahu’s domestic political allies and his US counterparts, who are pushing for restraint and a strict adherence to the ceasefire. Israel's limited response to a Hamas attack—air strikes followed by a return to truce—demonstrates a calculated effort to avoid breaking the agreement and maintain alignment with US policy. The success of this stage hinges on resolving deeper issues like Hamas disarmament and power transfer in Gaza, with the second stage of the peace plan now at a critical juncture. Netanyahu, known for keeping options open, maintains that war will continue until Hamas is dismantled, but growing evidence suggests that US influence is increasingly shaping Israeli military decisions.",
