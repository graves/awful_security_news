  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Steve Feinberg issued two memos in late October 2025 requiring Pentagon officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—to obtain prior approval from the legislative affairs office before communicating with Congress. This marks a significant shift from previous practices, where individual agencies managed their own communications. The move comes after most Pentagon reporters left the building, and appears to be part of a broader effort by Hegseth to exert tighter control over messaging. While Pentagon leadership frames the policy as a 'pragmatic step' to improve accuracy and transparency, critics may see it as reducing responsiveness and access to real-time information. A second memo established a working group to further define legislative engagement rules, signaling ongoing policy development. These changes raise concerns about transparency, independence, and the impact on congressional oversight of military affairs.",
