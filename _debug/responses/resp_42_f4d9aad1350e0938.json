  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amid an ongoing federal government shutdown beginning on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, will run out of funds by November, leaving approximately 42 million Americans at risk of losing food assistance. The administration has not committed to partial payments, and 17 states have suspended new applications due to system limitations. The Trump administration blames Democrats for political obstruction, while state officials and advocacy groups criticize the decision as a threat to food security, especially as Thanksgiving approaches. Although a $6 billion contingency fund exists, it is insufficient to cover the projected $8 billion in November benefits. Unlike WIC, which was temporarily protected with $300 million in tariff revenue, SNAP lacks such resources. Experts and advocates stress that this is a critical moment, as food pantries are already strained and vulnerable families face hunger without timely aid.",
