    "Israel is implementing new criteria to de-register major international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological reasons such as supporting 'terrorist activities' or inciting 'racism'.",
    "The Israeli military's COGAT committee, which includes representatives from the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, is reviewing INGO applications, often rejecting them without clear justification.",
    "Major aid organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and Mercy Corps have been denied registration or are in the appeal process, effectively halting their operations in Gaza and the West Bank.",
    "The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has been banned from sending aid or staff to Gaza since March 2025, despite evidence of no link between UNRWA staff and Hamas.",
    "Israel continues to restrict aid entry through only two of seven border crossings, with many aid trucks waiting months in Egypt and Jordan.",
    "The U.S. has cut funding to UNRWA, contributing to a funding gap that has not been fully replaced by other countries, further weakening humanitarian operations in Gaza.",
    "Humanitarian officials argue that the de-registration process is not about security but about politically motivated exclusion of aid groups, especially those with critical or independent stances.",
    "The Israeli government claims the restrictions are for security reasons, but no evidence supports these claims, and the process appears to target organizations with perceived critical viewpoints or diverse narratives.",
    "The U.S. and European governments have expressed concern, with the EU's top humanitarian official stating there is no evidence backing Israel's claims against UNRWA.",
    "Aid groups warn that de-registered organizations must cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank within 60 days, leaving humanitarian access severely compromised."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has introduced sweeping restrictions on international aid organizations in Gaza and the West Bank, de-registering major NGOs such as the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps under new ideological criteria that include accusations of supporting terrorism or inciting racism. These measures, enforced by the Israeli military’s COGAT committee, deny access to aid without clear evidence or transparency, with many organizations facing a 60-day closure of operations. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which has long been the primary humanitarian provider in Gaza, is also banned from operating, despite Israel’s claims of Hamas ties lacking evidence. Despite a ceasefire brokered by President Trump promising increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, and hundreds of aid trucks are stranded in Egypt and Jordan. Humanitarian officials argue that the policy is not about security but about politically motivated exclusion, undermining global efforts to deliver life-saving aid to a region devastated by war and infrastructure destruction.",
