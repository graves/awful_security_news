  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Israeli authorities identified the body of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli soldier killed on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack on Israel. Haimi was the 13th deceased hostage identified since the US-proposed ceasefire deal was signed on October 9, 2025. His body was recovered via Red Cross transfer from Gaza and returned for burial, with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressing condolences to his family. The ceasefire agreement requires Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours, but Israeli intelligence and officials have expressed concern that Hamas may not be able to locate or identify all remaining bodies due to extensive war damage. A prior body handed over by Hamas was found not to belong to an Israeli hostage, raising questions about misidentification or compliance. Amid diplomatic tensions and accusations of violations, the US, through President Donald Trump, has threatened to 'eradicate' Hamas if it fails to uphold the agreement. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held high-level meetings with Israeli military leaders to reinforce ceasefire implementation, while Israeli officials, including Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, stressed that the return of all deceased hostages must be fulfilled 'one way or another'.",
