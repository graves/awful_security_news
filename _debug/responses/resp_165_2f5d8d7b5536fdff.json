  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of the ongoing war, Ukraine’s northern city of Chernihiv experienced a total blackout due to a massive Russian assault involving over 100 Iranian-designed Shahed drones and six ballistic missiles. The attack targeted power generation facilities, killing four people and injuring ten, including a 10-year-old girl, in the nearby town of Novhorod-Siverskyi. With its proximity to Russia and Belarus, the region is especially vulnerable. Authorities report a significant increase in attacks on civilian infrastructure, including petrol stations, suggesting a strategic shift by Russia to destabilize society rather than gain military advantage. This has severely disrupted water and electricity supplies, with long-term repair challenges due to delays in equipment production. Despite this, Ukrainian civilians show high morale, with communities supporting each other and essential services operating through backup systems. International cooperation, especially with US energy companies, is helping Ukraine rebuild its energy resilience, though the full economic and psychological toll of these attacks remains a serious concern.",
