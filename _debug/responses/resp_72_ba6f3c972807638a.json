    "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is appealing a lower court ruling that found Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey unlawful, citing a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
    "DOJ lawyer Henry Whitaker defended Habba’s appointment, stating that delegation of authority by the Attorney General is a recognized method under federal law and that such appointments are not unprecedented, even if rare.",
    "The court panel, composed of three judges (two appointed by Republicans, one by a Democratic president), questioned the legitimacy of the process, asserting that delegating full authority of a U.S. Attorney—such as oversight of criminal and civil investigations—is unprecedented and contrary to constitutional norms.",
    "Habba was initially interim US attorney, resigned, and then served as special attorney, designated as first assistant US attorney, before being delegated full authority by the Attorney General.",
    "A lower court judge ruled that the vacancy should be filled by the first assistant US attorney, or by a Senate-confirmed official or one with at least 90 days of service in the DOJ.",
    "The DOJ claims Habba’s appointment is valid under delegated authority, but critics, including Abbe Lowell, argue that delegating full powers of a U.S. Attorney is a novel and improper interpretation of federal law.",
    "The case has broader implications, with similar challenges being litigated in Nevada and California, and former FBI Director James Comey is also involved in related legal actions.",
    "Habba attributes the appointment to congressional obstruction, noting that lawmakers have blocked the nominations of over a dozen US attorney candidates, thus forcing the executive branch to act.",
    "The legal debate centers on whether delegation of full U.S. Attorney authority is lawful under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and whether such appointments constitute a circumvention of Senate confirmation requirements."

However, critics, including legal counsel Abbe Lowell, contend that delegating full powers of a U.S. Attorney—such as oversight of investigations and personnel—is unprecedented and unconstitutional, citing violations of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba, formerly a Trump attorney, was initially interim and later promoted through a series of designations before being delegated full authority. The case has broader implications, with similar challenges in Nevada and California, and involves legal and political tensions, including those involving former FBI Director James Comey and former White House aide Lindsey Halligan. The dispute reflects a larger debate over executive power, Senate confirmation requirements, and the role of political obstruction in federal appointments.",
