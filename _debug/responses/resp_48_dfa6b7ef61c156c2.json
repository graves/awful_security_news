    "Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, stonemason, writer, and public activist, was found guilty of terrorism charges and sentenced to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula shot at Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter during a public greeting in Handlova, leaving Fico with serious injuries including abdominal wounds and damage to his hip, hand, and foot.",
    "The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that the attack constituted terrorism, not just murder or an attack on a public official, citing that Cintula specifically targeted the prime minister.",
    "Cintula claimed he wanted to harm Fico, not kill him, because he opposed Fico's policies on Ukraine, media freedom, and cultural policies, which he said threatened Slovak freedom and society.",
    "The verdict has intensified political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming the opposition for societal anger, while the opposition accuses him of undermining democracy, media freedom, and covering up corruption.",
    "The court acknowledged Cintula's stated motive—expressing opposition to political policies—but still classified the act as terrorism due to its targeted nature and political intent.",
    "Fico, who has remained in public life despite ongoing health issues, has expressed forgiveness toward Cintula.",
    "Cintula has announced plans to appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust'.",
