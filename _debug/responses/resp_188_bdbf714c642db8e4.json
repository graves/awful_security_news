  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 'yellow line' in Gaza—established under Donald Trump's peace plan—marks a temporary military boundary where Israel controls about 53% of the territory. While Israeli far-right allies welcome this as a de facto border enabling new settlements or annexation, U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are pressuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to maintain ceasefire and avoid military escalation. Israel’s response to Hamas violations has been restrained, emphasizing troop attacks within the yellow line to preserve the truce. Netanyahu continues to insist that the war will not end until Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is demilitarized. However, growing influence from Washington is shifting strategic decisions, creating tension between domestic political demands and U.S. diplomatic expectations. The success of the second stage of the peace process—centered on Hamas disarmament and power transfer—will determine whether the yellow line becomes permanent or remains a temporary demarcation.",
