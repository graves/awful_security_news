  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This follows the 2018 shutdown, which was the longest in nearly 50 years, lasting 35 days and costing an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. In that previous event, about 800,000 federal employees were affected, with 300,000 furloughed and 500,000 exempted. The current shutdown reflects deepening political polarization, with narrow majorities and a lack of Senate supermajority votes to overcome a filibuster. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson oversees a historically narrow House majority, making bipartisan compromise difficult. This situation highlights how partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill can disrupt essential federal services and have significant economic and social consequences.",
