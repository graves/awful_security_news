In her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,' she reflects on the 2024 presidential debate, where she first noticed signs of Biden’s health issues, and argues that Democratic disunity — signaled by public figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney — undermined public trust and contributed to the party’s electoral loss. She also highlights systemic bias against Black women in political spaces, noting that their loyalty and political insight are consistently ignored. Her decision to become an independent is not a partisan defection but a call for accountability and a broader conversation about the future of American politics, urging people to actively participate in shaping a more inclusive and resilient democracy.",
