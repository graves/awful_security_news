A landmark law in California, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, bans repayment for on-the-job training (except in approved apprentice programs) and for benefits when employees are laid off without cause, while allowing limited agreements such as retention bonuses and tuition reimbursement for transferable credentials—subject to prorated repayment and a two-year maximum stay period.
