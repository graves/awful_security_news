  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Mexico, heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond caused severe flooding across five states, resulting in at least 64 deaths and 65 people still missing. The worst-hit areas were Veracruz, with 29 deaths and 18 missing, followed by Hidalgo (21 deaths, 43 missing), and Puebla (13 deaths, 4 missing). The National Civil Protection Coordination, led by Laura Velazquez Alzua, coordinated a national emergency response involving thousands of military personnel, including the Army, Air Force, and National Guard, to deliver food, water, and emergency aid. The heaviest rainfall occurred in Cerro Azul and Cuetzalan del Progreso, with 280mm and 286mm respectively. Approximately 100,000 homes were affected, and about 263,000 people lost power, though over 80% of electricity supply has been restored by repair workers. The government has also faced criticism over the lack of early meteorological warnings indicating such extreme rainfall.",
