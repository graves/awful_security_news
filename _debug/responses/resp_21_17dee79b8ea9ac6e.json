  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government shutdown has reached Day 21, becoming the second-longest in history, with the potential to surpass the 35-day record from the first Trump administration. Despite Democrats making the demand for extending Obamacare subsidies—widely supported by the public (72% of Americans, 51% of Republicans)—they are currently winning the blame game in public opinion polls, with Americans blaming Republicans more than Democrats. Historical patterns show that when a party makes unpopular policy demands (like the GOP’s border wall demand), they lose politically. In contrast, Democrats’ popular policy demand gives them leverage. Key consequences include delayed small business loans, halted food stamp aid, and missed paychecks. A turning point may occur on November 1, when open enrollment begins and Americans face significantly higher health insurance premiums. If Republicans fear these cost increases, they may be compelled to negotiate. This shutdown is politically complex because Democrats may hold out to gain a major political victory, especially given their base’s criticism of previous lack of resolve, while the public sentiment strongly favors blaming Republicans.",
