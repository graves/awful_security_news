  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him India would stop importing Russian oil, a claim India strongly denies. India’s foreign ministry states it has no knowledge of such a conversation, emphasizing its energy policy is based on stability, diversified sourcing, and meeting market demands. India remains a major buyer of Russian oil, with state-owned refiners like Indian Oil Corporation increasing purchases. Experts note the scale of imports and differences in crude quality make a sudden shift impractical. The situation highlights a broader geopolitical tension between the US and India, with India asserting its sovereignty and diplomatic independence, especially in energy and foreign policy. Despite US-imposed tariffs, India continues its energy partnerships with Russia and plans to host Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling deepening ties with Moscow.",
