  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During his second term, President Donald Trump has applied his proven branding strategies from his real estate business to the federal government, creating a range of named initiatives such as TrumpRx, the Trump Gold Card, a proposed Trump coin, the F-47 fighter jet, and the Rose Garden Club. These efforts, driven by Trump himself as 'branding in chief,' reflect a shift toward commercializing public institutions and using simple, memorable slogans like 'Make America Great Again' to build identity and public engagement. While such branding is not illegal, it has drawn criticism for violating longstanding norms of governmental neutrality and raising concerns about the politicization of public services and infrastructure. Trump’s team has also restructured social media operations to be faster and more reactive, resulting in controversy, including AI-generated offensive content. Experts note that while these tactics are effective in capturing attention, they blur the line between governance and self-promotion, potentially undermining public trust in institutions.",
