  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The widespread popularity of cowboy imagery in media, fashion, and politics reflects a deeper cultural trend rooted in American conservatism and nostalgia. While rooted in romanticized myths from the 1880s and popularized by Western films, the modern cowboy symbol is now used by politicians like Donald Trump and George W. Bush to represent individualism, patriotism, and resistance to urban liberalism. This trend is evident in TV shows like 'Yellowstone', fashion campaigns by brands such as Sweetgreen and Canada Goose, and celebrity projects like Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter'. However, the article highlights that these portrayals are selective, ignoring the real struggles of cowboys—such as poverty, low wages, and harsh working conditions—while whitewashing the historical truth that cowboys were often Mexican, Native, or enslaved Black Americans. Recent efforts by Black artists and communities, like Gabriela Hasbun’s 'The New Black West', are challenging these stereotypes by showcasing the active, diverse, and historically significant role of Black cowboys. Despite this progress, the cowboy image remains a mythologized symbol, reflecting broader political and cultural tensions in contemporary America.",
