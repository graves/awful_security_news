The Sudanese military intercepted some drones, but the strikes highlight ongoing threats to stability and reconstruction. This marks the third drone attack on the capital in seven days, with prior attacks on army bases. The conflict, which began in April 2023, has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, displaced nearly 12 million people, and created the world's largest displacement and hunger crises.

Meanwhile, over 800,000 people have returned to Khartoum since the army’s counteroffensive, and the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority has announced a phased resumption of domestic flights.",
