  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a former U.S. Representative from New York who was expelled from Congress in 2023 after admitting to fabricating details about his education, employment, and background. Santos pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, facing 23 criminal charges. Despite being expelled without a criminal conviction, Trump released him immediately from federal prison in Fairton, New Jersey, citing that Santos was a 'rogue' but not unlike other political figures who have made false claims. Trump compared Santos’ actions to a past misstatement by Senator Richard Blumenthal, though the comparison was widely criticized. This commutation aligns with Trump’s broader pattern of executive pardons, including those for Jan. 6 Capitol attackers and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.",
