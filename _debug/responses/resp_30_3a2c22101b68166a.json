  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the United States, has paused job offers to foreign applicants requiring H-1B visas in response to President Donald Trump’s announcement of a $100,000 fee on the program. This policy shift reflects growing concern among companies over rising costs and accessibility issues related to hiring skilled foreign talent, particularly from India, who have historically dominated H-1B applications. While the Trump administration argues the fee is meant to curb abuse, economists and businesses warn it could hinder innovation and competitiveness, especially in high-growth sectors like e-commerce and technology. The move signals a broader realignment of corporate hiring strategies under tighter immigration regulations.",
