  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year prison term at La Sante prison in Paris after being convicted of criminal conspiracy for accepting illegal campaign funds from Muammar Gaddafi. He is the first former head of state in the European Union to be imprisoned, marking a pivotal moment in European political accountability. The court, led by judge Nathalie Gavarino, deemed the offenses of 'exceptional gravity,' resulting in a mandatory jail term despite Sarkozy's denial and legal appeal for release. He will be held in solitary confinement with limited interaction, and while the full term is set for 2026, an appeal could lead to early release. Public reaction has been mixed, with supporters expressing sorrow and others criticizing the verdict as unjust.",
