The article highlights real-life experiences from Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, and Houston, featuring parents like Lelac Almagor, who now works in the bike industry after adopting a cargo bike, and Laura Mitchell, who launched a community bike library. Experts such as Philip Koopman and Jody Rosen emphasize technological advancements and historical context, showing that cargo bikes are part of a broader 21st-century bicycle boom. While cities with robust infrastructure like Minneapolis see high adoption, even places like Houston with limited facilities are beginning to embrace the trend. The key driver, according to Almagor, is seeing other parents use cargo bikes — turning an initially unusual sight into a normal, practical, and desirable parenting choice.",
