  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America, primarily driven by Generation Z, are increasingly challenging authoritarian or underperforming governments. In Madagascar in 2025, Gen Z activists succeeded in toppling President Andry Rajoelina, though the military now controls the government under Michael Randrianirina. Similar movements have occurred in Bangladesh (2024), Sri Lanka (2022), and Nepal (2025), highlighting a global trend of young people using social media to demand change. The article warns that African leaders should be wary, as the continent has the world's youngest population and deep-rooted governance failures, including corruption and unemployment. While youth protests are powerful, they are often met with resistance from both military and civilian leaders, as seen in Kenya and Uganda. Experts like Kingsley Moghalu and Swikani Ncube emphasize that these movements signal a growing political consciousness among young people, and if current challenges persist, such uprisings may become a regular feature of African politics.",
