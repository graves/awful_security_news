While the phrase has no clear meaning, it has become a social signal for belonging, used in classrooms, schools, and sports highlights. Experts note that its longevity is due to adult reactions and its role in post-truth communication. Teachers report frustration but also adapt by incorporating the phrase into classroom activities, showing both disruption and cultural integration. Experts argue that the phenomenon is not a sign of declining literacy or brainrot, but a natural part of youth language evolution. The meme is now facing competition from new phrases like '41,' suggesting it may soon fade — yet its impact on youth culture remains notable.",
