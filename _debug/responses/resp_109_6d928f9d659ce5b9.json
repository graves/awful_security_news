  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has introduced sweeping new rules to de-register major international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological grounds such as supporting 'terrorist activities' or inciting 'racism'. The process, managed by the Israeli military’s COGAT committee, includes a requirement for approval from the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, and has already resulted in organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps being denied registration. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement that pledged increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, with most aid requests rejected without explanation. Israel has also banned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from operating in Gaza, citing unfounded allegations that it employs Hamas members, despite no evidence. UNRWA's warehouses in Egypt and Jordan hold supplies sufficient to feed Gaza’s population for three months, but they remain inaccessible. The U.S. has ceased funding UNRWA, compounding the crisis, while humanitarian officials warn that Israel’s actions are not aimed at facilitating humanitarian delivery but at systematically excluding organizations it deems ideologically or politically hostile.",
