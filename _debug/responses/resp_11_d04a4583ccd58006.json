    "The GOP, particularly under President Donald Trump, is promoting a narrative that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists, despite evidence showing the rallies were largely peaceful.",
    "Multiple Republican officials — including House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Roger Marshall, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent — have amplified claims of violent left-wing activity, using broad, unsubstantiated labels such as 'terrorist wing' or 'hate America' rallies.",
    "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt made extreme claims that the Democratic Party's main constituency consists of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals, echoing past Republican criticisms of Trump supporters as 'basket of deplorables'.",
    "Historical data and polling show that left-wing violence does not surpass decades of right-wing violence, and public opinion is divided on whether left-wing or right-wing violence is worse, with 59% of Americans calling the GOP 'extreme'.",
    "The claims of widespread violence at the June 'No Kings' rallies are inconsistent with evidence: only five incidents of violence or arrests were reported, with two involving attacks on protesters and others involving counter-protesters or a mistaken shooting by a 'peacekeeper'.",
    "Democratic leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Ruben Gallego have warned that such rhetoric serves to justify militarization of the homeland and could incite violence.",
    "Protesters in Portland have responded with humor and costume-based protests, signaling resistance to Trump’s claims of widespread violence and calls for National Guard deployment.",
    "This rhetoric marks a strategic shift for Republicans, who have previously criticized such broad labels, now embracing them to justify political control and military action."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the lead-up to the 'No Kings' rallies on October 18, 2025, Republican figures including President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Roger Marshall, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt have launched an aggressive campaign claiming the events are dominated by antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists. These claims are contradicted by data showing the June rallies were largely peaceful, with only a few isolated incidents and no evidence of large-scale violence. The rhetoric echoes past Republican attacks on Trump supporters, such as the 'basket of deplorables' label, and is now used strategically to justify militarization and political control. Polling data indicates public skepticism, with Americans split on the severity of left- versus right-wing violence and a majority seeing the GOP as extreme. Democratic leaders warn that such narratives could incite violence and justify overreach, while protesters in Portland have responded with humor to counter the false claims.",
