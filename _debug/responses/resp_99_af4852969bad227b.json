  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile is a proven and effective long-range strike weapon with a combat history spanning Iraq, Syria, Libya, and elsewhere. Despite its power and precision, Ukraine currently lacks both the ground-launch platform (Typhon) and sufficient numbers of missiles to deploy them effectively. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly requested Tomahawks to enable strikes on key Russian targets such as the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, arguing they would strengthen Ukraine’s position and pressure Russia to negotiate. However, the US, under former President Donald Trump, has stated it has few Tomahawks available and needs them for domestic defense. Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, views the delivery of such weapons as a hostile act due to the Tomahawk’s potential nuclear capability and has issued warnings of escalation. While Ukraine has developed its own Flamingo cruise missile, it lacks the capacity to scale production. Ultimately, even if a few dozen Tomahawks were delivered, they would not be a decisive game-changer, and Ukraine’s most urgent need remains robust air defense against Russian missile and drone attacks.",
