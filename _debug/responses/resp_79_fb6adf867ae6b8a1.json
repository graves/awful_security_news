  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As artificial intelligence drives unprecedented demand for data centers, companies are exploring space-based solutions to overcome the limitations of terrestrial infrastructure, including land scarcity and high carbon emissions. European-led initiatives like the ASCEND project and startups such as Madari Space, Lonestar Data Holdings, and Starcloud are testing small-scale space-based computing systems. These efforts aim to leverage continuous solar energy and reduce environmental impact, though significant challenges remain, including heat dissipation, radiation, cost, space debris, and security threats. While critics argue that current terrestrial solutions remain more cost-effective and reliable, proponents believe space-based data centers are essential to avoid technological stagnation as Earth’s resources are exhausted. The sector is still in early stages, with key milestones including Madari’s 2026 launch and Lonestar’s planned moon-based launch in 2027.",
