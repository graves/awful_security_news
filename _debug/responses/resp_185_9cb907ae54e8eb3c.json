Experts stress that recognizing individual capacity, adjusting goals, and establishing boundaries—even in hierarchical workplaces—are vital for mental well-being. The article concludes that burnout is not just a symptom of stress but a diagnosable condition involving exhaustion, detachment, and reduced performance, and that proactive self-care and boundary-setting are key to long-term resilience.",
