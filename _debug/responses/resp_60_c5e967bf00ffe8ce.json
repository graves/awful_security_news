  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A powerful storm, identified as Typhoon Halong with the strength of a Category 2 hurricane, caused catastrophic flooding in remote Alaska Native villages such as Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, destroying up to 90% of homes in Kipnuk and rendering over one-third of homes in Kwigillingok uninhabitable. More than 2,000 people were displaced, with many evacuated by military aircraft to Anchorage, where they are being temporarily housed. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to access federal aid for emergency and long-term recovery, as many residents may not return to their homes for at least 18 months due to the scale of damage and the harsh Arctic climate. Personal accounts from evacuees like Alexie Stone and community leaders like Nellie Unangiq Jimmie highlight the emotional and cultural disruption of displacement, while Anchorage officials emphasize a commitment to welcoming and supporting those affected. The event underscores the vulnerability of isolated Arctic communities to extreme weather events and the urgent need for federal intervention in disaster response.",
