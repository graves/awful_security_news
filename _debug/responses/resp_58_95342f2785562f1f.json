Hamas denied involvement, claiming it has returned 12 of 28 deceased hostages and remains committed to the agreement. The AQB reported finding a missing Israeli hostage and warned that further escalation would hinder recovery efforts. While aid deliveries continue, the Rafah crossing remains closed, and Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticized the decision as a political backdown. The ceasefire faces ongoing strain due to internal Hamas security operations targeting collaborators and Israel-backed militias, including an alleged public execution in Gaza City.
