    "The US Marine Corps conducted a live artillery firing over I-5 in California, a major interstate highway, during a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton.",
    "The first shell fired exploded prematurely over the highway, causing at least one shell fragment to strike a parked California Highway Patrol (CHP) cruiser, damaging it.",
    "This incident occurred despite the Marine Corps having not fired over I-5 in over 70 years, and the route was not used since the 1950s.",
    "No injuries were reported, but the event raised serious safety concerns, with California Governor Gavin Newsom criticizing the decision to fire over a major highway.",
    "The 155mm artillery shells used were part of a surge in US production (tripled since 2022, reaching 40,000 rounds per month), driven by Ukraine’s war with Russia and the need for munitions.",
    "The shell that detonated came from a batch previously tested successfully with over 20 shells fired the day before, raising questions about batch consistency and safety.",
    "A 2024 Reuters investigation revealed past issues with manufacturing lines, including cracked shells and a switch from TNT to a less stable explosive, later reversed due to production demands.",
    "The military often stages special demonstrations for VIPs, such as Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who attended the event, emphasizing the symbolic importance of such displays.",
    "Retired Marine Corps colonel Mark Cancian noted that while firing over I-5 was theoretically safe due to high altitude, the premature detonation was abnormal and indicates a potential flaw in manufacturing or handling.",
    "The affected shell batch has been frozen and will not be reused until further investigation is complete."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the US Marine Corps’ 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, live artillery firing was conducted over the I-5 interstate highway—a route not used since the 1950s. The first shell fired prematurely detonated, sending fragments that struck a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle, raising serious safety concerns. While no injuries occurred, the incident prompted criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had previously closed the highway due to safety fears. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause, especially since the shell was part of a batch previously tested successfully. This event is unusual due to the high altitude of the shells and the precedent of such demonstrations being rare. Past manufacturing issues, including a shift to a less stable explosive in 2024 and later a return to TNT for production efficiency, have added context to the incident. The demonstration, which included VIPs like Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, underscores the military’s tendency to stage special events for high-profile visits, but the premature detonation highlights a troubling gap in safety protocols and munitions reliability.",
