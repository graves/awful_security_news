  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a U.S.-Pakistan citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a firearm with marijuana and cocaine. The Trump administration defended the law, claiming habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, especially during police encounters while impaired. However, a lower court ruled that the law lacks historical precedent and cannot target habitual users, leading to an appeal. The case raises significant constitutional questions about the Second Amendment, particularly whether modern drug use laws can be justified without historical support. The decision could reshape national gun policy, especially in light of growing state-level marijuana legalization and recent political attention, including the case of Hunter Biden, who was convicted and later pardoned under the same law. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2025.",
