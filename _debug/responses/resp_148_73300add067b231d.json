  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, with forecasted strong winds and a risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high. The province has activated evacuation plans for vulnerable areas, including coastal zones and landslide-prone slopes, following a routine drill that has historically protected lives. This event occurs amid a broader pattern of recurring disasters, including deadly earthquakes and typhoons, which have recently overwhelmed communities. Scientists link the increasing intensity of storms to climate change, and the Philippines, already vulnerable due to its geographic location and poverty levels, continues to face mounting risks from natural disasters.",
