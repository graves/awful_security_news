  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible in the Caribbean have been repatriated to their home countries—Ecuador and Colombia—where they will face legal prosecution. The strike, part of at least six operations since early September, targeted a vessel confirmed to be carrying large quantities of fentanyl and other narcotics, with U.S. intelligence indicating it was on a known narcotrafficking transit route. The administration justified the military action as part of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, drawing a legal precedent from the Bush-era war on terrorism, and claimed that the operation resulted in the deaths of at least 29 people. The repatriation avoids legal complications regarding the status of the survivors under U.S. law.",
