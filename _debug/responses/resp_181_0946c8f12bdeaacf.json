  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the US Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, with a large live artillery demonstration involving fighter jets, Navy vessels, and live fire—marking the largest such event in a decade in the continental US. The exercise, which took place near a busy section of Interstate 5, sparked controversy when California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized it as dangerous and closed a portion of the highway to protect public safety. Vance defended the demonstration, dismissing Newsom’s claims as fear-driven and politically motivated, while using the event to promote his own military service, criticize 'woke' diversity policies within the Pentagon, and blame Democrats—especially Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer—for a recent government shutdown. Despite the federal shutdown, military personnel are being paid by the Defense Department, highlighting a key contrast between civilian and military operations.",
