  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Walmart has paused job offers to foreign candidates needing H-1B visas after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee on the visa program, which is designed for high-skilled workers. As one of the largest private-sector employers in the U.S., Walmart currently employs over 2,000 H-1B visa holders and has responded to the new cost by adjusting its hiring policies. The move reflects broader economic and political tensions, where immigration policy changes—such as Trump’s fee proposal—disproportionately affect skilled professionals from India, who have historically made up the majority of H-1B applicants. This shift demonstrates how political decisions on immigration can significantly impact corporate hiring, economic competitiveness, and global talent mobility.",
