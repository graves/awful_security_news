President Donald Trump announced the project as a private initiative, claiming it would be funded by private donors and 'zero cost' to taxpayers, and stated that the ballroom would accommodate 999 people—up from 650 originally announced. The East Wing, built in 1902 and home to the first lady's offices, will be temporarily relocated. Carrier Global Corp. has donated an HVAC system for the project. The construction, which began in September with site prep and has now moved into active demolition, is scheduled for completion before Trump’s term ends in early 2029, raising legal, procedural, and political concerns about federal oversight and the use of public property.",
