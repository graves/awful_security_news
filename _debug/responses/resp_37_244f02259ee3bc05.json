    "Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, stonemason, and public activist, was found guilty of terrorism charges for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico five times in May 2024.",
    "The attack occurred during a public event in Handlova, Slovakia, when Fico was greeting citizens, and Cintula fired from within one meter of the prime minister.",
    "Fico was seriously wounded—four times in the abdomen, and injuries to his hip, hand, and foot—and made a public appearance in July 2024, returning to work shortly after.",
    "Cintula admitted to the shooting and claimed his motive was to stop Fico’s policies, which he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture.",
    "The court, led by Judge Igor Kralik, ruled that Cintula specifically targeted the prime minister, thus qualifying as terrorism under the law, not a general attack on a citizen.",
    "The sentence of 21 years is less than the maximum of life in prison, indicating the court did not classify the act as a life-threatening terrorism offense requiring the harshest punishment.",
    "Cintula’s defense argued that not every attack on a public official constitutes terrorism, and sought a lesser sentence.",
    "Fico’s legal team described Cintula as a terrorist who sought to establish violent political confrontation as a norm.",
    "The attack revealed deep societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming the opposition for creating social anger, while the opposition accuses Fico of undermining democratic standards, media freedom, and covering up corruption.",
    "Fico has expressed ongoing health issues related to the attack and has publicly forgiven Cintula.",
    "Cintula plans to appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust'."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. Cintula shot Fico five times from within one meter, seriously injuring him, and claimed he wanted to stop Fico’s policies on media, culture, and foreign relations, which he believed threatened Slovak freedom. The court, led by Judge Igor Kralik, ruled that the attack constituted terrorism because it was specifically directed at a political leader, not a random citizen. The defense argued it was not terrorism, but the court upheld the terrorism charge, citing Cintula’s intent. Fico, who has suffered ongoing health issues, has forgiven Cintula, while Cintula plans to appeal the verdict. The incident exposed deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the opposition of fueling social anger and the opposition accusing Fico of undermining democracy and media freedom.",
