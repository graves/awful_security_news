The coral-encrusted structures are expected to become accessible to divers and snorkelers in just 15 to 20 feet of water, and future phases may feature 57 giant starfish sculptures as a symbol of the city. The project is both a scientific restoration effort and a cultural initiative, using art to revitalize marine life and provide an underwater ecotourism experience.",
