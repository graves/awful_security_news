  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a shocking heist on October 20, 2025, nine precious historical artifacts were stolen from the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery in Paris in just seven minutes. Among the stolen items are a sapphire diadem, an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise, and several pieces of jewelry belonging to Empress Eugénie. The items, which include a reliquary brooch with the historic Mazarin diamonds and a diamond bow brooch crafted from a 19th-century belt, were valued at millions of euros. Experts describe the heist as a 'national disaster' due to the loss of France’s crown jewels and national heritage. One of the items, Eugénie’s crown, was recovered outside the museum but was damaged during the theft. Art recovery expert Arthur Brand warns that the thieves will likely dismantle and melt the gold and silver to sell the gemstones, indicating a potential effort to profit from the theft. The cultural and historical significance of these items—crafted by renowned jewelers and passed through generations of royal families—makes the theft a profound blow to French national identity and cultural preservation.",
