Trump and Vice President JD Vance mocked the protests with AI-generated memes portraying Trump as a monarch, reinforcing a narrative of unchecked power. The article highlights Trump’s controversial pardons, such as that of George Santos, and his unilateral military actions abroad, including strikes in the Caribbean and threats against Colombia and Venezuela, all of which are viewed as unconstitutional and authoritarian. The administration’s dismissal of protesters and suppression of media scrutiny further intensify concerns about democratic erosion. Demonstrators, including moderates, participated to protect democratic norms, with organizers claiming 7 million attendees. The article concludes that Trump’s behavior is not only juvenile but proves the protesters’ point: that he is treating the U.S. as a monarchy, undermining constitutional checks and public dissent.",
