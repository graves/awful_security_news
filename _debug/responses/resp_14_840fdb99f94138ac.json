  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A high-profile heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, occurring on Sunday, October 20, 2025, saw approximately $102 million worth of royal jewelry—belonging to queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense and a gift from Napoleon to Marie-Louise—stolen by two armed men who used a truck-mounted ladder and tools such as an angle grinder and blowtorch to break into the Apollo Gallery. The heist lasted just four minutes, with the robbers leaving at 9:38 a.m. and fleeing on scooters along the Seine. Despite ongoing investigations, including the recovery of a scooter and helmet, and efforts to extract DNA from the truck, experts believe the jewelry has likely been dismantled or melted to facilitate money laundering. Security failures, including unsecured windows and public access to a basket lift, have been publicly acknowledged by French officials. Experts and public figures, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin and author Elaine Sciolino, emphasize the deep cultural and national trauma of the theft, comparing it to past museum heists like the 1911 Mona Lisa robbery. There is widespread concern that the items are permanently lost, and the case is suspected to be linked to organized crime.",
