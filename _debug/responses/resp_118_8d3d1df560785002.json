  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a historic performance on October 18, 2025, Shohei Ohtani delivered a legendary two-way performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, hitting three home runs and striking out 10 batters while pitching shutout ball into the seventh inning. His first homer off Brewers starter Jose Quintana became the first leadoff home run by a pitcher in MLB history, and his 469-foot blast in the fourth cleared a pavilion roof. The Dodgers used this dominance to sweep the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, becoming only the fifth team to sweep a best-of-seven series and the first since 2019. The victory marks the Dodgers' first postseason sweep in 16 years and advances them to the 2025 World Series for the 23rd time in franchise history. Ohtani was named NLCS MVP, cementing his status as one of the greatest individual postseason performers in baseball history. The Brewers, who led the majors with 97 wins, were eliminated for the third time in seven playoff appearances and have not advanced to the World Series since 1982.",
