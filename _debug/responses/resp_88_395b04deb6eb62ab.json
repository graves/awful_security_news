  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to have withstood its first major test after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, triggering retaliatory airstrikes from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that killed at least 44 people. Both sides accused each other of violating the agreement: Israel blamed Hamas for attacks beyond the Yellow Line in Rafah and for delaying the return of hostages, while Hamas denied involvement and claimed it conducted a security campaign against collaborators and Israel-backed militias. Despite the violence, Hamas and the IDF affirmed their commitment to the ceasefire, and aid deliveries continued into Gaza, signaling an effort to preserve the agreement. Key US figures, including Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and Vice President JD Vance, are involved in diplomatic efforts to reinforce the deal. However, tensions remain high, with political backlash from figures like Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, and ongoing violence, including a reported public execution of eight people in Gaza City, undermining confidence in the truce.",
