  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is closely investigating the federal government’s response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement campaign that resulted in over 1,000 arrests. In a recent hearing, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for all federal agents on the ground, especially to prevent unannounced use of tear gas and pepper balls. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras and are aware of the mandate, ICE Special Response Teams have not been issued cameras and would need congressional approval to obtain them. Testimonies from ICE and CBP officials indicate that agents are trained in crowd control and press management, but incidents such as one where Pastor David Black was struck multiple times without warning have raised serious concerns about accountability. The judge plans to depose former ICE official Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino to get more insight into the on-the-ground actions, highlighting a broader issue of leadership turnover and transparency within federal enforcement agencies.",
