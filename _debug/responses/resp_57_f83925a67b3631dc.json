  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombians are experiencing growing anxiety amid a diplomatic feud between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Trump has accused Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to cut US aid and raise tariffs on Colombian exports, which account for 30% of Colombia’s exports. This has raised fears among ordinary citizens about job losses, increased prices, and visa complications for families in the US. Petro responded by calling Trump’s claims 'rude and ignorant' and had previously faced visa revocation for criticizing US military actions in the Caribbean. The conflict underscores a failure of both leaders to address the real drug problem, with Colombia’s economy and people suffering from political posturing rather than effective solutions.",
