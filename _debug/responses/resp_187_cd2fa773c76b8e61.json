  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cate Blanchett, a celebrated Hollywood actress, has become a passionate ambassador for the Kew Gardens Millennium Seed Bank (MSB), which celebrates its 25th anniversary. The MSB, located at Wakehurst Botanic Garden in Sussex, houses over 2.5 billion seeds from 40,000 wild plant species and plays a vital role in both preserving biodiversity and restoring degraded habitats globally. Originally conceived as a 'doomsday vault' to protect plant species from extinction, the bank now actively supports ecological restoration projects such as those in the South Downs and post-wildfire recovery in Australia. The project has gained renewed relevance due to climate change, with rising wildfire intensity threatening native species like those in Australia. The King (formerly Prince of Wales) has publicly emphasized the urgency of plant conservation. Cate Blanchett, who visited the site and engaged in hands-on seed work, expresses deep admiration for the project and believes it represents a powerful, tangible source of hope in an otherwise grim world.",
