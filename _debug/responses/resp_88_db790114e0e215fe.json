  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a high-energy Thursday Night Football clash dubbed the 'Icy Hot Bowl' by Steelers teammate Cameron Heyward, 40-year-old Joe Flacco outperformed 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers in a dramatic 33-31 victory for the Cincinnati Bengals over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Flacco, acquired to replace injured starters Joe Burrow and Jake Browning, threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns, including key plays to Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and Noah Fant, and orchestrated a crucial two-minute drive culminating in a winning field goal by Evan McPherson. The Steelers, led by Rodgers who passed Ben Roethlisberger to move into fifth place on the NFL all-time passing yards list, had briefly led with a 68-yard touchdown to Pat Freiermuth, but ultimately couldn’t recover. Despite the loss, the game highlighted the enduring relevance of veteran quarterbacks in the NFL, with both Flacco and Rodgers delivering standout performances in a game that kept fans engaged and underscored the resilience of aging athletes in modern football. The Bengals improved to 3-4 on the season, while the Steelers fell to 4-2 and remain atop the AFC North, preparing for a pivotal showdown against the Green Bay Packers in Week 8.",
