  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, centered on a 100% tariff threat from US President Donald Trump in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China claims its restrictions are a justified defense against US trade curbs targeting its maritime and tech industries, while the US argues its actions are based on national security. The situation is set against a backdrop of prior trade wars, including reciprocal tariffs, semiconductor embargoes, and export controls under both Trump and Biden administrations. Experts suggest that China's rare earth restrictions are a strategic prelude to negotiations with Trump, while the US is calibrating pressure to avoid market disruption. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea adds urgency, as both sides maintain escalation tools, signaling a sustained phase of great power economic competition with global implications for technology, supply chains, and global trade stability.",
