  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Navy detained two survivors of a military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, marking the first time the Trump administration has held individuals post-attack in such operations. The strike, confirmed by President Donald Trump, targeted a vessel described as a drug-carrying submarine and is the sixth such operation against suspected traffickers. The incident raises significant legal concerns, as the U.S. has not formally declared war or authorized such military detention under Article I, and legal experts question whether the administration’s actions fall within constitutional or statutory authority. The operation is part of a broader strategy to reduce drug flow into the U.S. and pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been accused of offering resource access in exchange for political concessions. The detained men may pursue legal challenges through habeas corpus petitions, potentially exposing the administration’s legal justification for the actions.",
