  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on October 19, 2025, turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, citing the devastating realities of the conflict and advocating a ceasefire along current battle lines. The meeting, described by European officials as tense and confrontational, contradicts Trump’s earlier claim that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. Trump reportedly raised his voice and expressed frustration, especially over Ukraine’s request for long-range missiles capable of reaching Russia. A Ukrainian proposal for a territorial swap involving the Donbas and southern regions was referenced, with Putin previously suggesting a similar deal. Trump denied demanding the full cession of Donbas, stating that about 78% of Ukraine’s land is already under Russian control. Zelensky expressed pessimism about the demands and emphasized the importance of preserving Ukrainian sovereignty. Despite the tension, both leaders agreed on a ceasefire at current battle lines, a position Trump reiterated in public statements. The meeting underscores a shift in Trump’s approach to peace, driven by a focus on de-escalation and the urgency of ending the war, especially after his success in brokering a Gaza truce.",
