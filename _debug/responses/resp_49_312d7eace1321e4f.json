  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of VA mental health providers and veterans report that one-on-one therapy sessions are being abruptly limited or terminated under a new policy implemented since January 2025, under the leadership of VA Secretary Doug Collins, who was appointed during President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell, who have long relied on sustained therapy for PTSD and trauma, describe feeling abandoned and re-traumatized when sessions are cut short without clinical justification. Providers such as Mark Jorges and Stephen Long have resigned or retired due to policy pressures, citing that such limits are inappropriate for chronic mental health conditions. While the VA claims there are no limits on sessions and that care is patient-centered, providers report they now must justify extensions in writing and face disciplinary consequences for pushing back. The American Psychological Association has acknowledged the reports and emphasized the need for individualized, recovery-oriented care. Critics argue that shortening therapy violates clinical standards and may worsen veteran outcomes, especially when patients need ongoing support.",
