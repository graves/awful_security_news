The attack, which occurred when Israeli tanks fired on a civilian vehicle attempting to reach their home in Zeitoun, violated the agreed 'yellow line' and has sparked condemnation from Hamas, which calls for international pressure on Israel to comply with the ceasefire. Despite the ceasefire, Israel continues to restrict aid deliveries, seal key crossings like Rafah, and block access to heavy machinery needed for retrieving remains from rubble. These actions, combined with ongoing killings of Palestinians and severe humanitarian shortages — including only 49% of people receiving emergency water levels — have deepened the crisis. Hamas remains committed to the ceasefire terms, including returning captives’ remains, but is hindered by Israel’s denial of equipment. The situation reflects a deteriorating peace, with civilians at risk due to poor communication, lack of internet access, and continued military violations.",
