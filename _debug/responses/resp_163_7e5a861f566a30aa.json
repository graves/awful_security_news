  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has received two coffins containing bodies that Hamas claims are two deceased Israeli hostages, bringing the total number of returned bodies under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal to 15 out of 28. The bodies were transferred via the Red Cross from Gaza to Israeli military forces, who will conduct formal identification in Tel Aviv. The Israeli military has urged public sensitivity and emphasized that Hamas must uphold the agreement to return all deceased hostages, particularly given that Hamas previously handed over a Palestinian body due to difficulties locating bodies amid rubble. The ceasefire deal, which also saw the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees, includes a reciprocal return of 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli hostage body. Despite these developments, violence has flared up over the weekend, and concerns remain about the completeness and transparency of the hostage exchange process, especially given the scale of destruction in Gaza and the high death toll—over 68,000 according to Hamas figures—since the 7 October 2023 attack.",
