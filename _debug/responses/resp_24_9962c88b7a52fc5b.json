  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Republican-controlled states across the U.S. are actively redrawing congressional district lines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, with North Carolina at the center of a high-stakes battle. The state’s Republican lawmakers have proposed a new congressional map that would increase GOP representation from 10 to 11 seats by altering Don Davis’s competitive district in eastern North Carolina. The effort is seen as a direct response to President Donald Trump’s national call for redistricting to secure a Republican majority in the U.S. House. Trump has publicly praised the map as a victory for his 'America First' agenda, while Democrats have condemned the process as a 'brazen power grab' and a political arms race initiated by Republicans. Similar redistricting actions are underway in Texas, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, and Utah, with legal challenges and public campaigns emerging in each. Critics argue that Republicans are exploiting the process to entrench Trump’s political future, while Democrats seek to counterbalance these efforts through voter initiatives and legal action, highlighting a nationwide political struggle over the integrity of democratic representation.",
