He had previously claimed he asked for a pardon from Trump, which he believed was blocked by 'gatekeepers'. In an open letter, Santos pleaded for 'fairness' and a chance to rebuild. The commutation was celebrated by Santos’ legal team and allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Anna Paulina Luna, who supported him during his incarceration.

The case underscores ongoing debates over presidential clemency, accountability in public office, and the political implications of executive power.",
