  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO and the Western Australian Museum discovered two new marine species — a semi-transparent porcelain crab about 1.5cm long, found at 122 meters below sea level, and a glowing West Australian Lantern Shark up to 40cm long, found over 600 meters deep — during a 2022 deep-sea expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park. These discoveries highlight the rich but underexplored biodiversity of Australia's oceans, where over 20 species have been identified and an estimated 600 more remain to be described. The findings underscore the importance of marine research, especially in deep-sea environments, where unique adaptations like bioluminescence and filter feeding reveal evolutionary innovations critical to survival in extreme conditions.",
