  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Republican Curtis Sliwa, a longtime WABC radio host and perennial mayoral candidate, is facing mounting pressure from within his own party to withdraw from the 2025 New York City mayoral race. His boss, John Catsimatidis, a Republican supermarket magnate and radio owner, has publicly urged Sliwa to step down, arguing that he should prioritize New York City over political ambition. The pressure comes as Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, seeks to unite Republican voters against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani by positioning himself as a moderate alternative and pushing Sliwa out. However, Sliwa has defiantly rejected the pressure, emphasizing that he represents blue-collar working-class voters and that billionaire donors should not dictate election outcomes. Trump has mocked Sliwa’s image, calling him 'not exactly primetime' and ridiculing his affinity for cats. Despite claims of coordination between Sliwa and Mamdani, both candidates have dismissed such suggestions, reinforcing a narrative that voters should make the final decision on New York City’s future.",
