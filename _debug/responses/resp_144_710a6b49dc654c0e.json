  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, with forecasted gusts of up to 80km/h and a risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high. The evacuation is part of a regular drill, as Catanduanes is often the first landmass affected by cyclones in the western Pacific. The storm comes amid a period of ongoing disaster strain in the Philippines, following recent deadly earthquakes in Cebu and southern regions, as well as Typhoon Ragasa in September. Scientists emphasize that climate change is intensifying storm patterns, making extreme weather events more frequent and severe in disaster-prone areas like the Philippines.",
