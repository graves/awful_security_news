  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is undergoing a major renovation with the demolition of parts of its East Wing to build a new $250 million ballroom for President Donald Trump. While Trump claims the new structure will remain separate and respectful of the historic building, critics including the National Park Service, the Society of Architectural Historians, and the American Institute of Architects have raised concerns about the lack of a rigorous design and review process. The East Wing, constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942, is being gutted, and the project has been criticized as the first significant exterior change to the White House in 83 years. The project is privately funded, with Clark Construction managing the build and McCrery Architects designing the interior. Despite Trump’s assertion that the renovation honors historical integrity, experts warn that the absence of standard oversight reflects a departure from tradition and historical preservation norms, raising broader questions about presidential authority and national heritage.",
