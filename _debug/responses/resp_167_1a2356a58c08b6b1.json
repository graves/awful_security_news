A long-time member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and protege of former Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Fumio Kishida, Takaichi is known as Japan’s 'Iron Lady' for her conservative ideology, echoing Margaret Thatcher’s policies. She advocates for economic revival through 'Abenomics,' opposes same-sex marriage and immigration, supports a male-preference imperial succession, and takes a 'China hawk' stance, including visits to Taiwan and the controversial Yasukuni Shrine. Her victory follows a period of decline for the LDP, which lost its majority and dissolved its alliance with the Sanseito party; she now governs with support from the Japan Innovation Party. Experts note that while her policies emphasize strong defense, US-Japan ties, and a firm stance on China, she must soften her hardline positions to avoid a no-confidence vote and address domestic challenges such as the cost of living and ongoing corruption within the party.",
