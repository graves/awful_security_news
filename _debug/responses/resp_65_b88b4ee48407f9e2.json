  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is capitalizing on momentum from a fragile ceasefire agreement in Gaza to accelerate diplomatic efforts involving Russia and China. While the Gaza deal remains under strain due to Hamas’s failure to deliver remains of deceased hostages, Trump and his envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are working to maintain its integrity. Trump has also pushed for a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest and a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, aiming to resolve conflicts in Ukraine and trade. Despite efforts to support Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, Trump backed away from the offer, citing concerns about war escalation and winter losses. The article highlights the fragility of peace deals and the difficulty of translating success in one region to broader global diplomacy, especially with nuclear-armed adversaries who are not dependent on U.S. support. The narrative reflects a broader theme of leveraging diplomatic momentum, though with significant risks of failure or political backlash.",
