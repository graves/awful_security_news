  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A widespread redistricting battle is unfolding across the United States, with Republican-controlled legislatures in seven states—including North Carolina, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Indiana, Ohio, and Utah—redrawing congressional boundaries to increase GOP representation. The effort, largely driven by President Donald Trump, aims to secure Republican majorities in the 2026 House midterms, particularly in competitive districts like North Carolina’s Don Davis district. North Carolina’s map, approved swiftly by Republican lawmakers despite public protests and criticism from Governor Josh Stein, shifts 11 out of 14 House seats to Republicans. Democrats are responding with legal challenges, public protests, and voter referendums, with California launching a major counter-effort. The political arms race reflects deeper tensions over gerrymandering, democratic accountability, and the role of federal influence in state-level redistricting.",
