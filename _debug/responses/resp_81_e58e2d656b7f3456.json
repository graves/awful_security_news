  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown, the White House announced that it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — funds typically allocated to child nutrition programs — to sustain the WIC program, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This decision follows a shift from an initial plan to redirect Section 232 tariff revenue, and aims to prevent the program from shutting down due to a lack of congressional appropriations. While the National WIC Association supports the effort to maintain operations, it raises concerns about the clarity and sustainability of the funding, including timing, amount, and distribution. Experts question the legal authority of the administration to reallocate tariff revenue without congressional approval. The article highlights bipartisan concern over the impact of the shutdown on vulnerable populations and underscores broader debates over federal funding, political accountability, and the stability of critical social programs.",
