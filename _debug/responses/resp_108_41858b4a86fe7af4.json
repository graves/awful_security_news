Despite deep political polarization, the volunteers—organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network—focused on shared goals: funding cancer research, expanding cancer screening access, and maintaining health insurance subsidies. Personal stories of cancer loss and survival were central to their messaging, demonstrating that emotional and medical experiences can override political differences. The event, held on September 16, 2025, saw volunteers visit 484 congressional offices and culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall honoring lives lost to cancer. The article underscores that, amid national political conflict, bipartisan support for cancer-related policies persists due to the personal impact of the disease on millions of Americans.",
