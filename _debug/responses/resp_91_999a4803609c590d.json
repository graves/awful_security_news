    "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile is a proven, long-range, precision-guided weapon used in past operations such as the Gulf War, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.",
    "The Tomahawk has a range between 1,600 and 2,500 kilometers and flies at high subsonic speeds (about 550 mph), making it difficult to detect and intercept.",
    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly lobbied the US, particularly the Trump administration, for the delivery of Tomahawks to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov oblast.",
    "The US currently has few Tomahawks available for export, with President Trump stating that the US needs them for its own national defense and security.",
    "The Tomahawk would be far more effective than Ukraine’s current long-range drones, capable of delivering high explosive payloads and causing substantial damage to Russian infrastructure.",
    "Russia has expressed strong concern over the potential delivery of Tomahawks to Ukraine, viewing it as a hostile act that threatens global security, with SVR head Sergey Naryshkin calling it a 'hostile move'.",
    "Ukraine currently lacks a ground-launch system like the Typhon to fire Tomahawk missiles, which are primarily sea-launched.",
    "Ukraine is developing its own cruise missile, dubbed the Flamingo, which is said to have a similar range to the Tomahawk, but its capabilities remain unclear and production is limited due to lack of resources.",
    "Despite the potential strategic value of Tomahawks, Ukraine’s primary military need remains improved air defense systems to counter increasing Russian missile and drone attacks.",
    "Zelensky met with US defense manufacturers Lockheed Martin and Raytheon during his visit to Washington in October 2025 to pursue a $90 billion weapons procurement deal."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range precision weapon, is being considered by Ukraine as a strategic tool to strike deep into Russian territory. Despite its combat history and high explosive capability, Ukraine currently lacks the necessary ground-launch system (the Typhon) to deploy it and has been denied access due to US concerns about domestic defense needs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently advocated for Tomahawk delivery to weaken Russian infrastructure—such as the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base—but the US, under President Donald Trump, has stated it has few missiles available and needs them for its own security. Russia has reacted with alarm, warning that such a move would constitute a hostile act threatening global stability. While Ukraine is developing its own Flamingo cruise missile, its capabilities remain unproven and unscalable. Ultimately, the article underscores the geopolitical tension and strategic limitations involved in Ukraine's long-range strike capabilities, emphasizing that while Tomahawks offer significant military potential, their current unavailability limits Ukraine’s ability to conduct deep strikes against Russia.",
