  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, California, to celebrate the US Marine Corps’ 250th birthday, a 155mm artillery shell fired over I-5 exploded prematurely, sending shrapnel that damaged a California Highway Patrol vehicle. This incident, which occurred during a rare firing over a major highway not used since the 1950s, raised serious safety concerns and prompted criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom. The Marine Corps has not explained the decision to fire over I-5, the timing of the last such event, or why the shell detonated despite prior successful firings from the same batch. The incident highlights ongoing issues in artillery production, including a 2024 Reuters investigation revealing manufacturing defects and a shift in explosive type. Since 2022, US production of 155mm shells has tripled to support Ukraine’s war effort, with over 3 million shells delivered. Experts like retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian emphasize that while the high trajectory of shells was theoretically safe, the premature detonation is abnormal and raises questions about quality control and training protocols.",
