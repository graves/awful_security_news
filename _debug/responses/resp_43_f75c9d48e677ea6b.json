  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been abandoned, with the U.S. administration now stating there are no immediate plans for a meeting. A prior expectation of a summit within two weeks following a phone call between Trump and Putin has been replaced by a lack of progress, including divergent views from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on ending the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has maintained that a summit cannot be postponed without a scheduled date, while U.S. officials argue that Lavrov lacks real influence on policy decisions, making bilateral talks between him and Rubio ineffective. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes Russia’s reduced diplomatic engagement to the U.S. refusal to provide Ukraine with long-range missile capabilities, suggesting that such capabilities are key to peace. Despite the stalled summit plans, Trump continues to advocate for negotiations to begin at the current battle line, and the administration is now considering future meetings between Rubio and Lavrov at international events like the ASEAN summit in Malaysia.",
