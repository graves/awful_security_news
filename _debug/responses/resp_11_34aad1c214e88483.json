  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite international calls for a ceasefire, including from US President Donald Trump, Russian forces continue to advance in multiple regions of Ukraine, using record numbers of guided aerial bombs and drones. The Ukrainian military reports significant challenges in intercepting drones and is under pressure in key towns like Kupiansk and Pokrovsk. While Russia has gained about 120 square miles in territory over four weeks, Ukrainian commanders assert they lack strategic initiative and have repelled major offensives. Russia has suffered massive casualties—over 950,000 total with 250,000 dead—and is now altering recruitment tactics, possibly mobilizing reserve forces. Ukraine, in turn, is targeting Russian energy infrastructure to pressure the Kremlin, disrupting one-fifth of its refining capacity. Despite these efforts, Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no sign of seeking negotiations, and the war, which has lasted over 1,300 days, remains unresolved.",
