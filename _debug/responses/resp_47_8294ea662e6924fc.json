  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a new legal dispute, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald, the lead defense attorney for former FBI Director James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Prosecutors claim that communications between Comey and Fitzgerald contain evidence of such leaks, raising concerns about Fitzgerald’s impartiality. Fitzgerald counters that the memos in question were initially unclassified and that no evidence exists of classified information being released, citing a prior inspector general report. The legal conflict highlights a broader tension over attorney-client privilege, the ethics of legal representation, and the boundaries of information sharing during high-stakes political investigations. Experts note that a defense lawyer involved in leaking classified material may have a disqualifying conflict of interest, even if only as a witness.",
