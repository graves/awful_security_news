  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the Physiology or Medicine Prize awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full award schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, covering medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics. The article highlights the historical origins of the Nobel Prizes, established by Alfred Nobel, and details the nomination process, secrecy, and evaluation criteria. It emphasizes the scientific and societal impacts of past laureates, such as Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun in medicine, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton in physics, and David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper in chemistry. The literature prize went to Han Kang for her powerful exploration of trauma and identity, and the peace prize to Nihon Hidankyo for its advocacy of nuclear disarmament. A major point of public attention is the controversy surrounding former U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of deserving the peace prize, which experts say are unlikely due to the prize’s focus on durable peace and institutional efforts. The article also underscores concerns about academic freedom under political influence, with Ylva Engstrom warning that political interference from the Trump administration threatens scientific independence. The prizes are formally presented on December 10, with ceremonies in both Stockholm and Oslo, and are broadcast globally, reflecting their importance as cultural and scientific milestones.",
