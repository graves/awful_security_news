The bodies were delivered via the Red Cross and escorted into Israel by the Israeli military, where formal identification will take place in Tel Aviv. The IDF emphasized the need for public sensitivity and stressed that Hamas must uphold the agreement to return all deceased hostages. The ceasefire also involved the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza.
