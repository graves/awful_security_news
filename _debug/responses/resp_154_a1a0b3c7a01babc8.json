  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Skardu Valley, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing animal behavior, cloud formations, and sound cues—is being used by shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain to predict and prevent deadly glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite significant government investment in early warning systems (EWS) since 2017, including the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems have consistently failed due to malfunctions, lack of maintenance, and poor community engagement. As a result, local residents have turned to traditional, community-based warning methods, such as gunfire signals and fire alerts, which have proven effective in saving lives. Pakistan, one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations despite minimal emissions, faces rising temperatures and frequent glacial floods. The failure of official systems has led to widespread distrust, with reports of no real-time data links and no accountability. The article underscores a critical global challenge: that technology alone cannot ensure safety without local trust, cultural relevance, and participatory implementation. In response, the government has begun recognizing individual acts of courage, such as awarding rewards to shepherds who saved lives—highlighting a growing need to integrate Indigenous knowledge into national climate resilience strategies.",
