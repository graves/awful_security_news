  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest have been shelved after a failed preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The decision follows growing disagreements over the war in Ukraine, especially regarding the Donbas region and the feasibility of a ceasefire at the current front line. While Trump advocated for a halt to hostilities along existing battle lines, Russia insisted on complete withdrawal of Ukrainian forces and broader territorial demands, including recognition of Russian sovereignty over Donbas and demilitarization of Ukraine — positions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. The collapse of the summit plans appears tied to the perception that Russia’s demands are unsustainable, and that the only factor forcing Russian engagement is the prospect of long-range US missile supplies to Ukraine, which triggered diplomatic action. The White House may have canceled the meeting to avoid a repeat of the previous August summit, which produced no results.",
