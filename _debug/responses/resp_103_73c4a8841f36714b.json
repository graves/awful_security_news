  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals that reversing decades-old advice — which previously advised against giving babies peanuts — has led to a significant drop in peanut and food allergies among U.S. children. Since the 2015 LEAP study showed that early exposure to peanuts reduces allergy risk, updated guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended introducing peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months for high-risk infants. As a result, the prevalence of peanut allergy has declined by 43% and overall food allergy by 36% in the U.S. over the past decade, preventing at least 40,000 cases. The reversal is credited with helping shift peanut allergy from being the top cause of food allergies in children under 3. However, researchers note limitations, including reliance on diagnostic codes and incomplete adoption of guidelines due to parental concerns. Only about 10% of children who develop peanut allergies outgrow them, emphasizing the long-term public health importance of early allergen introduction.",
