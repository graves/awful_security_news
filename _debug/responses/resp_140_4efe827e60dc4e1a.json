  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed plans for an imminent Trump-Putin summit, following initial speculation after Trump announced a meeting in Hungary within two weeks. The delay is attributed to a deepening rift over ceasefire conditions: while Trump and allies advocate for freezing the current battle lines, Russia insists on retaining control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and dismantling its military capabilities, a stance unchanged since the Alaska summit. The US and Ukraine have criticized Russia’s 'maximalist' approach, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accusing Moscow of stalling peace efforts. A preparatory call between US and Russian foreign ministers was held, but no further in-person meetings are planned. The situation underscores the growing impasse in Ukraine peace negotiations and raises questions about the feasibility of a meaningful ceasefire.",
