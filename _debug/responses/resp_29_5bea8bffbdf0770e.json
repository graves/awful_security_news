The controversy arises as NASA considers opening the $2.9 billion contract to SpaceX to allow competition, which could jeopardize SpaceX’s role in the mission scheduled for mid-2027. Musk defended SpaceX’s technical achievements, including its successful human certification of a new orbital vehicle, and publicly supported Jared Isaacman, a former SpaceX astronaut and NASA administrator candidate, who has expressed no confidence in being renominated. Despite Duffy’s statements about potentially placing NASA under the Department of Transportation, his spokesperson clarified he has no intention of becoming NASA’s permanent administrator, only of helping evaluate candidates. This situation reflects broader tensions between private space innovation and government oversight in the context of the U.S. space race with China.",
