  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies—specifically CBP and ICE—after reporting that agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls without warning protesters during demonstrations tied to Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration immigration crackdown. Judge Ellis issued a restraining order requiring body-worn cameras, limiting use of force, and ensuring transparency, which federal officials claim they are following. However, the judge expressed serious concern that the administration may not be complying, citing reports of violations and lack of disclosure. Officials including Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers testified, but the judge stressed the need for higher-level accountability, especially from former ICE Chicago head Russell Hott, who will be deposed later. Protests at the Broadview ICE facility have continued, with over 100 demonstrators and 30 arrests reported, signaling sustained public resistance to immigration enforcement actions.",
