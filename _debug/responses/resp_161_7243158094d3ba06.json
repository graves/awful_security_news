  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United Nations World Food Programme reports that food supplies to the Gaza Strip remain critically low, delivering only 750 metric tonnes daily—far below the 2,000-tonne target—due to just two open crossings: Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara. Despite expanding to 26 food distribution points, the WFP still falls short of its goal of 145 points across Gaza. Humanitarian aid has reached northern Gaza via southern routes, but not in sufficient quantities, and the main Salah al-Din Street remains closed. The ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump is seen as essential for saving lives and halting famine. Hamas has committed to handing over 28 captives’ bodies, having delivered 13, with the Rafah crossing remaining closed until further notice. Families in Gaza are storing food due to fears of renewed conflict, and the situation underscores the urgent need for more open crossings and sustained international humanitarian access.",
