  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 AWS outage exposed the world's deep dependence on US-based cloud technology, particularly in the UK, where critical services like Lloyds Bank and HMRC were affected. AWS and Microsoft Azure dominate the UK cloud market, each with 30–40% share, creating a fragile ecosystem where a single failure can cascade across industries. Experts highlight 'nested dependency' and systemic risks, arguing that relying on a few large tech firms undermines digital resilience and national sovereignty. While such providers offer cost and scalability advantages, their dominance raises concerns about geopolitical vulnerability and lack of competition. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has called for regulatory action, including designating AWS and Microsoft as 'strategic market status' providers, to promote fair competition and diversification. Experts and policymakers agree that political intervention—such as mandating multi-cloud use and data replication—is essential to build a more resilient, sovereign, and open digital infrastructure.",
