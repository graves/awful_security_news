Former Chief Terry Gainer describes the job as demanding, requiring officers to balance enforcement with hospitality. Union Chair Gus Papathanasiou and Representative Joe Morelle have called for action to end the shutdown and restore pay and dignity. Some lawmakers, like Senator Katie Britt, express sympathy for the officers, blaming political impasse, while others, such as Speaker Mike Johnson, claim support but are criticized for past actions, including delaying the installation of a memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol on January 6. The Trump administration has proposed using repurposed funds to pay law enforcement, but Democrats challenge the legality of this plan. A confrontation between Representative Nanette Barragán and an officer during a protest has further highlighted tensions, with the union demanding accountability. While officers remain committed 'for now,' one officer warns that morale may not withstand the full duration of the shutdown.",
