  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article describes how over 500 cancer survivors, including individuals from New York such as Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin, united in Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress during an annual citizen advocacy day. Despite differing political affiliations—Johnson voted for Donald Trump three times, Mealing is a Democrat, and Martin avoided discussing politics—participants emphasized a shared bond through personal experience with cancer. The event took place on September 16, 2025, during a federal government shutdown, and volunteers focused on three key issues: increased cancer research funding, retention of Affordable Care Act subsidies, and expanded access to cancer screening. While some Republican lawmakers opposed subsidy extensions, both parties supported research funding and screening. The event concluded with a candlelight vigil at the National Mall, honoring 10,000 individuals impacted by cancer. The article underscores that personal experience with illness can transcend political divides, demonstrating a powerful, bipartisan movement driven by shared loss and urgency.",
