  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has formally relinquished his royal titles, including Duke of York, after enduring prolonged public and legal scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct linked to Jeffrey Epstein and ties with a Chinese national, Yang Tengbo. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles and Prince William, follows a long history of accusations, including a 2015 lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed Andrew engaged in sexual abuse with underage girls under Epstein’s direction. Despite repeatedly denying the allegations, Andrew has faced significant reputational damage, leading to the loss of military positions and charitable roles. The scandal has sparked broader public debate on royal accountability and transparency. While Andrew will no longer attend royal events and will no longer use his title, he retains his title as 'Prince' due to his lineage from Queen Elizabeth II and continues to reside at Royal Lodge. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will now be referred to without her title, while his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, retain their titles. The case also involved the revelation of Yang Tengbo’s authorized role in business meetings with Chinese investors, raising concerns about foreign influence. Virginia Giuffre’s death in April 2025 and the release of her posthumous memoir add further weight to the allegations and public discourse.",
