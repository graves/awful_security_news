  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Indiana University has sparked a national controversy by eliminating the print editions of its student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, and firing its faculty adviser Jim Rodenbush for refusing to remove news stories from a homecoming edition. While the university claims the move is financially driven and part of a transition to digital media, student journalists and legal experts argue that it constitutes censorship and violates the First Amendment, as student editors, not faculty advisors, hold editorial control. The Indiana Daily Student, long recognized as one of the best collegiate publications, continues publishing online, maintaining editorial independence. The incident has drawn strong criticism from advocates, including billionaire Mark Cuban and legal experts from the Student Press Law Center, who say public universities like Indiana University should uphold student media freedom. This conflict raises broader questions about academic autonomy, financial sustainability, and the role of student journalism in democratic society.",
