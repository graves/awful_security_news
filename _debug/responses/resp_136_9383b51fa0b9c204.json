  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton to commemorate the 250th birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps, a 155 mm artillery round prematurely detonated overhead, sending metal shrapnel that damaged a California Highway Patrol vehicle and struck an officer’s motorcycle. The incident occurred on Saturday, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to close a 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 for safety. Despite the Marine Corps asserting that the exercise was safe and within protocols, a possible airborne detonation outside the designated area led to the immediate suspension of firing. No injuries were reported, but an investigation has been launched. Vice President JD Vance observed the drills, which sparked bipartisan controversy over public safety and political risk-taking. The event underscored tensions between military readiness demonstrations and civilian safety concerns.",
