  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has proposed a federal funding compact for nine universities, offering preferential grants and access to White House events in exchange for ideological reforms, including eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions and capping international enrollment. Seven universities — including MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, UVA, and the University of Arizona — have formally rejected the proposal, arguing that it threatens academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based competition. Critics claim the compact undermines the integrity of research and innovation by tying federal funding to political ideologies. The White House insists the compact fosters a diverse marketplace of ideas, while university leaders emphasize that academic governance should remain independent and free from external political influence. The deadline for initial signatories is November 21, 2025, with several schools still in consultation or undecided.",
