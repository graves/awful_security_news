  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris in 2025 involved thieves scaling a truck-mounted ladder during museum hours, using industrial tools like an angle grinder and blowtorch to steal nine Napoleonic jewels from the Apollo Gallery. The incident marks a shift in museum crime from stealing high-value artworks to targeting raw materials such as gems and coins that can be melted down for resale. This trend is linked to prior heists, including the 2019 Green Vault robbery in Dresden and earlier art thefts like the 1911 Mona Lisa heist. Experts, including Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath, warn that such attacks reflect a growing trend of 'cultural terrorism' with high liquidity and low cultural value in mind. Evidence such as discarded tools and the damaged crown of Empress Eugénie suggests a well-planned, organized operation. French authorities suspect a connection between multiple thefts in Paris and Limoges, possibly tied to organized crime like the Remmo clan. The heist has sparked national outrage and prompted a broader investigation into museum security, with Interpol adding the stolen artifacts to its database.",
