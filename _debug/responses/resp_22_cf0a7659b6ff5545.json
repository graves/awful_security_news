  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile test in five months, launching short-range missiles from south of Pyongyang toward the northeast, with no landing in the sea. The test occurred days before US President Donald Trump’s planned visit to South Korea and Asia, raising concerns about regional stability. South Korea’s military detected the launch and remains prepared to respond, while Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi emphasized real-time missile data sharing with US and South Korean allies. Experts suggest the test is a calculated move by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, to assert its nuclear status and pressure the United Nations to lift economic sanctions. Kim previously displayed the Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile at a military parade, describing it as his nation’s most powerful nuclear weapon, capable of carrying multiple warheads and evading US missile defenses. This missile development and the timing of the test signal a significant escalation in North Korea’s weapons program ahead of a major regional diplomatic summit.",
