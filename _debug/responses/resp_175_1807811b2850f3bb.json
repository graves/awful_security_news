  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has voluntarily given up all royal titles and honours — including Duke of York, Knight of the Garter, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh — amid escalating public scrutiny and damaging revelations. The decision follows a series of events including a private email showing Andrew maintained contact with Jeffrey Epstein longer than he claimed, Virginia Giuffre’s memoir detailing toxic ties between Andrew and Epstein, and contradictions in Sarah Ferguson’s public statements. The move was prompted by mounting pressure from the public, media, and U.S. officials like Robert Garcia, who criticized the situation as long overdue, and was made to avoid a formal legislative process that could have damaged the monarchy’s reputation. While Prince Andrew retains his residence at Royal Lodge with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters will keep their princess titles, he will no longer attend royal events such as the Christmas gathering or the Order of the Garter parade. The incident underscores the tension between protecting royal institutions and addressing misconduct, especially when powerful individuals are implicated in abuse.",
