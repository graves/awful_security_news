  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a call from US President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces are advancing in multiple areas of Ukraine, including Kupiansk and near Vovchansk and Pokrovsk. The Russian military has increased its use of aerial bombardments and drones, with a record 268 guided bombs deployed in one day and over 180 drones launched nightly. Ukrainian forces report that around 20% of drone attacks are not intercepted. Russian advances are met with strong Ukrainian resistance, and Ukrainian commanders deny that Russia holds strategic initiative. Russia has suffered massive casualties, with over 250,000 soldiers killed or wounded, and is now cutting recruitment bonuses, possibly turning to mobilizing reserves. Ukraine is using long-range strikes to disrupt Russian energy infrastructure, affecting one-fifth of its refining capacity. Despite this, Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no willingness to negotiate or end the war, suggesting a prolonged, high-cost conflict that continues beyond 1,300 days since the invasion began.",
