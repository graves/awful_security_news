  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Oklahoma’s new school superintendent, Lindel Fields, has rescinded a mandate introduced by his predecessor, Ryan Walters, which required Bibles to be placed in classrooms and integrated into student lesson plans for grades 5–12. The directive, which drew widespread criticism from civil rights groups and sparked a pending lawsuit before the Oklahoma Supreme Court, was seen as an effort to promote religion in public education. Fields emphasized that the decision on religious instruction should remain with individual school districts and rejected spending taxpayer funds on Bibles. He also announced a broader review of all mandates from Walters’ administration, including controversial teacher ideology exams for applicants from California and New York. This move reflects a shift toward educational neutrality and accountability, with legal and public support for ending religiously driven classroom policies.",
