  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Belize has signed a bilateral agreement with the United States to serve as a 'safe third country' for migrants deported from the U.S., allowing them to apply for asylum in Belize instead of returning to their home countries. The deal, which requires strict security measures including nationality eligibility, background checks, and Belize's sovereign authority to approve or reject transfers, has been praised by the U.S. State Department as a key step in curbing asylum abuse. However, human rights organizations and Belize’s opposition have raised serious concerns about the safety of migrants and the implications for national sovereignty and public finances. This agreement follows similar ones with Paraguay, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras, all acting under U.S. policy initiatives led by President Donald Trump and enabled by a Supreme Court ruling that allows deportations to third countries without prior asylum hearings.",
