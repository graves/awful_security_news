  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has urged global action to strengthen early-warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities. Climate change is intensifying weather events, with more than 2 million people dying from weather-related disasters over the past 50 years, primarily in developing nations. While progress has been made—such as a rise in countries using early warnings from 52 to 108—the situation remains dire, especially in fragile and conflict-affected regions. Real-world examples, including the evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, after a glacier collapse in May 2025, and severe weather in Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, and southern Europe, underscore the urgency. The WMO stresses that early warnings enable early action and saves lives, emphasizing that no region is immune to climate-related disasters.",
