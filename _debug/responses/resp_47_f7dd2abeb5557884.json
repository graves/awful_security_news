  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 heist at the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery, where thieves used industrial tools to steal Napoleonic crown jewels during museum hours, marks a dramatic escalation in museum crime. Unlike traditional art thefts focused on cultural value, this heist targets valuable raw materials like jewelry and coins that can be melted down or sold for profit. The incident follows similar patterns seen in the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden and the 1990 Gardner Museum heist, signaling a shift toward militarily precise, industrial-style theft. French authorities and experts like Remigiusz Plath and Laura Evans warn that museums are becoming more vulnerable due to open access, weak security, and the use of powerful tools. Evidence such as discarded grinders, a walkie-talkie, and the dropped crown of Empress Eugénie supports the sophistication and urgency of the crime. The theft is being investigated as part of a possible broader pattern linked to organized crime, with French and international bodies like Interpol involved. The incident underscores a growing concern that cultural heritage is being targeted not for preservation, but for financial gain, with potentially irreversible losses to national history.",
