  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective weapon used in multiple conflicts including Iraq, Syria, and Libya, has been requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to enable strikes deep into Russian territory. However, due to limited US stockpiles and domestic defense needs, the Trump administration has stated that few Tomahawks are available for export. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launch system (the Typhon) to deploy the missiles, and its own cruise missile (the Flamingo) remains unproven and underproduced. While the Tomahawk could significantly damage key Russian infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, Russia warns that supplying them would be seen as a hostile act, threatening global security. Despite this, Zelensky argues that Tomahawks would strengthen Ukraine’s military position and pressure Russia to negotiate. The article emphasizes that while Tomahawks are strategically valuable, Ukraine’s most urgent need remains advanced air defense systems to counter Russia’s growing missile and drone assaults.",
