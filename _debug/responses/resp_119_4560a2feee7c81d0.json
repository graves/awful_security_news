  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, several top institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Virginia, and Dartmouth College—have publicly rejected the agreement. The compact would require colleges to restrict transgender student access to restrooms and sports, freeze tuition for five years, limit international enrollment, and mandate standardized testing. These rejections are rooted in concerns about academic integrity, scientific merit, and the politicization of federal funding. The White House held a meeting with multiple schools to discuss the compact, but subsequent statements from UVA and Dartmouth reaffirmed their opposition. Critics argue that the policy threatens fundamental principles of academic freedom and research autonomy, especially given past cancellations of federal grants over issues like DEI and transgender policies.",
