  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite not being on the ballot, Donald Trump plays a pivotal role in the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, where both major parties are leveraging his influence. Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli is actively seeking to mobilize Trump supporters, while Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill is using Trump’s policy decisions—like canceling the Gateway tunnel—to criticize his administration and rally opposition. The races reflect broader concerns about voter sentiment, especially in swing areas like Passaic County, where Trump made a narrow gain in 2024. Democrats are banking on 'voters’ remorse' as a strategy, hoping that backlash from Trump’s second term will lead to a reversal of support. The outcomes may provide key insights into voter behavior and political realignment heading into the 2026 midterms.",
