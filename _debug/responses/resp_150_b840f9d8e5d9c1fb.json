  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The expectation of a near-term Trump-Putin summit in Hungary has been officially dismissed by both the US and Russian officials, as differing positions on ceasefire conditions — particularly Russia’s demand for control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and the requirement to eliminate the conflict’s 'primary causes' — have created a diplomatic impasse. While Trump and Putin previously agreed on a ceasefire framework during a summit in Alaska, their current positions diverge significantly, with Russia maintaining its maximalist stance and the US and Ukraine advocating for a freeze of the current battle lines. A phone call between US Foreign Minister Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was conducted, leading the White House to conclude that an in-person meeting is unnecessary. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders have criticized Russia’s stalling tactics, accusing it of continuing violence while refusing to engage in meaningful negotiations. As a result, the path to a sustainable peace remains blocked, and the prospects for a Trump-Putin meeting in the immediate future appear unlikely.",
