  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election on October 20, 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga with 54.5% of the vote. This marks the end of nearly two decades of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS), which governed since 2006. The election emerged amid Bolivia’s worst economic crisis in a generation—characterized by plummeting natural gas exports, soaring inflation, and fuel scarcity—leading to widespread voter disillusionment with the MAS government. Paz’s moderate platform, advocating private sector-led growth while preserving social programs, resonated with left-leaning voters who were wary of Quiroga’s austerity measures. Despite his victory, Paz’s party does not hold a legislative majority, requiring coalition-building to govern. His campaign was bolstered by the populist appeal of running mate Edman Lara. Both candidates pledged to strengthen diplomatic ties with the United States, with Paz announcing a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal to secure fuel supplies. The incoming administration faces significant challenges, including fuel import shortages, subsidy reform, and potential labor protests from the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB). Analysts view the election as a historic political turning point, signaling a new chapter in Bolivian democracy and a shift toward greater economic openness and U.S. engagement.",
