  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump has expressed disappointment over the shelving of planned face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating he did not want a 'wasted meeting'. The discussions, initially scheduled for Budapest within two weeks, were canceled after key differences emerged—particularly Russia’s refusal to accept a ceasefire along the current front line. A preparatory meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was deemed unnecessary following a 'productive' call. European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky support freezing the conflict at the current battle line as a foundational step toward peace, while Moscow insists on broader, maximalist demands including full Russian sovereignty over Donbas and the demilitarization of Ukraine. The potential U.S. supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine is said to have prompted Russia’s diplomatic engagement, and Zelensky views the missile issue as a 'strong investment in diplomacy' despite no tangible agreements. Trump’s earlier discussions with Zelensky and Putin reportedly involved contentious exchanges over territorial concessions in Donbas, which Zelensky firmly rejected.",
