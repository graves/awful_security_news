The other hostage's identity remains undisclosed, though their family has been notified. The return of these bodies, the 14th and 15th since the ceasefire deal on October 9, 2025, underscores ongoing challenges in recovering all missing hostages due to rubble, destruction, and potential misidentification by Hamas. Israeli authorities emphasize the need for sensitivity and official confirmation before informing families. US Vice President JD Vance affirmed the importance of recovering bodies, noting that some are buried under rubble and recovery is difficult but not impossible. The ceasefire remains fragile, with both sides accusing each other of violations, and Israeli intelligence believes Hamas may not be able to locate all remaining deceased hostages.",
