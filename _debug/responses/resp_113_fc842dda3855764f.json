  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political divisions in the U.S., over 500 cancer survivors and advocates from across the country, including individuals like Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin, united in Washington, D.C., during an annual lobby day organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Despite their differing political affiliations—Johnson having voted for Donald Trump three times, Mealing being a Democrat, and Martin not discussing her politics—participants emphasized that cancer does not care about political identity. The event, held on September 16, 2025, saw volunteers visit 484 congressional offices to advocate for increased cancer research funding, expanded screening access, and continued health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Although some Republican lawmakers resisted subsidy extensions, both parties supported research and screening. The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, where 10,000 tea lights honored individuals affected by cancer. The article underscores how shared personal experiences can foster empathy and bipartisan cooperation in the face of political polarization.",
