  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president-elect in 20 years, won a decisive 54.5% of the vote in a runoff election held on October 20, 2025, ending decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. His victory marks a significant political shift, as he pledged to rebuild relations with the United States — particularly with the Trump administration — and to attract foreign investment, rejecting an IMF bailout that many voters viewed as a sign of foreign control. Facing a severe economic crisis, including hyperinflation (23% in September 2025), Paz announced plans to target fuel subsidies through direct cash transfers to poor families while maintaining stable prices for transport workers. His campaign, led by social media-savvy running mate Edman Lara, drew support from rural and working-class voters disillusioned with past corruption. While Paz emphasizes restoring institutional integrity and addressing judicial overreach, critics warn that reforms could threaten Indigenous representation, especially given past political shifts. The election results sparked protests in La Paz and Santa Cruz, with supporters of the former president Jorge Quiroga alleging fraud, reflecting deep skepticism about Bolivia’s electoral integrity and the legitimacy of the new conservative leadership.",
