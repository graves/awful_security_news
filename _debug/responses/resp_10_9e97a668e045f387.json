  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products to reflect a potential link between its use in pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. The company argues that such changes are unsupported by scientific evidence and would contradict long-standing FDA guidelines and decades of research showing no causal link between acetaminophen and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The push originated from claims by former President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suggested that Tylenol increases autism risk, despite a lack of conclusive evidence. Multiple scientific studies, including one involving over 2 million children, have found no significant associations between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD. In contrast, the European Union, United Kingdom, and Health Canada have reaffirmed the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Kenvue has formally requested the FDA to reject a citizen petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network, asserting that the proposed labeling changes are arbitrary and not in line with scientific consensus.",
