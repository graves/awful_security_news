  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, causing widespread blackouts and civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes this to a deliberate strategy of inflicting suffering through cold and disruption. The Ukrainian government has responded with a two-pronged strategy: strengthening air defenses and launching retaliatory missile strikes on Russian facilities such as the Bryansk Chemical Plant. Amid persistent shortages of US-supplied weapons and air defense systems, Ukraine is turning to European allies, seeking financial and military aid. The European Union is exploring the use of $200 billion in frozen Russian assets as a loan to support Ukraine’s war effort, though Russia denies this is legal. Zelensky is also urging a shift in diplomatic momentum, warning that a possible summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban could be detrimental to Ukrainian interests. Analyst Tatiana Stanovaya notes a recurring pattern: when US President Donald Trump expresses frustration with Russia, Moscow escalates attacks, suggesting a cyclical dynamic in the conflict.",
