    "The introduction of peanut products to infants as early as 4 months of age has led to a more than 27% decline in peanut allergy rates among young children, rising to over 40% after expanded recommendations in 2017.",
    "Approximately 40,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies since 2015 due to early exposure guidelines, not 60,000 as previously reported.",
    "The LEAP trial, led by Dr. Gideon Lack at King’s College London, demonstrated that early peanut introduction reduced future allergy risk by over 80%, with protection persisting in about 70% of children into adolescence.",
    "Despite the strong evidence, adoption of the guidelines was initially slow, with only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists following the 2017 recommendations.",
    "The new research confirms that early allergen introduction is now being adopted and is making measurable public health impacts.",
    "Updated 2021 guidelines recommend introducing peanuts and other major allergens between 4 and 6 months of age, without prior screening, and suggest safe exposure methods like small amounts of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based yogurts.",
    "Advocacy groups like Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) support the shift, emphasizing that early introduction is a critical step in reducing the prevalence of food allergies nationwide."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies by over 80%, new research confirms that these recommendations have made a measurable impact in the real world. Since 2015, peanut allergy rates among U.S. children under age 3 have dropped by more than 27%, and by over 40% after expanded guidelines in 2017. The study, led by Dr. David Hill of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices and found that approximately 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015. Despite initial slow adoption—only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists followed the 2017 guidelines—current evidence shows increasing adoption and real-world effectiveness. The 2021 updated guidelines now recommend introducing peanuts and other major allergens between 4 and 6 months of age, without prior screening, using safe exposure methods such as small amounts of peanut butter or soy-based yogurts. Advocacy groups like FARE support these changes, emphasizing their importance in reducing the nationwide prevalence of food allergies, including life-threatening anaphylaxis.",
