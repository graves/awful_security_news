  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House began demolishing part of the East Wing in October 2025 to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. The project, which was initially announced in July, will allow the ballroom to accommodate up to 999 people, significantly expanding from the original 650-seat capacity. While Trump claims the construction will cost nothing to taxpayers and is privately funded through donations from wealthy individuals and companies like Carrier Global Corp., which has donated an HVAC system, the White House has not disclosed full donor information. The East Wing, built in 1902 and housing key offices including those of the first lady, will be temporarily relocated during construction. The project is the largest structural change to the White House since 1948 and has sparked debate over federal oversight, historical preservation, and executive authority in major renovations.",
