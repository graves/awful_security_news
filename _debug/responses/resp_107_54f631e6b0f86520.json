    "The phrase 'common sense' is frequently used by President Donald Trump to justify policy decisions and discredit opponents, emphasizing a populist, non-academic, and 'lived experience' approach to governance.",
    "Trump’s usage of 'common sense' is more frequent than any other political figure, and it serves as a rhetorical tool to delegitimize opposing viewpoints, labeling them as ideologically driven or outside mainstream values.",
    "The phrase has deep historical roots in Thomas Paine’s 1776 pamphlet 'Common Sense,' which challenged British colonial rule and invoked the idea of ordinary citizens' basic moral and experiential judgment.",
    "The phrase appeals to rural communities, older voters, and those who perceive a need to return to a 'simpler past,' aligning with the core demographics of Trump’s political base.",
    "Common sense is used by Democrats too, such as President Barack Obama's 'common sense gun reform' and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 'common sense' call for healthcare affordability, showing its broad political utility.",
    "In Trump’s hands, 'common sense' can be demagogic — implying that the opposition is irrational or nonsensical, thus reducing debate to binary oppositions between 'common sense' and 'nonsense.'"

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the political significance of the phrase 'common sense' in American politics, focusing on its frequent and strategic use by President Donald Trump. Drawing on historical roots in Thomas Paine’s 1776 pamphlet, the article explains how Trump employs the phrase to frame his policies as intuitive, morally sound, and in line with ordinary people’s lived experience. The rhetoric is particularly effective among rural voters and older demographics, aligning with Trump’s base. The article also notes that Democrats have used 'common sense' as a policy framing tool, such as in Obama’s gun reform and Ocasio-Cortez’s healthcare proposals. However, critics like Sophia Rosenfeld and Frank Luntz argue that Trump’s usage is demagogic, reducing opposition to 'nonsense' and allowing for norm-shattering policies — like deploying the National Guard in cities — to be justified under the guise of common sense.",
