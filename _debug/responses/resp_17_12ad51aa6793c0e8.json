With national DSA membership reaching a record 80,000 and a surge in grassroots organizing, members are increasingly embracing socialist policies such as rent control, childcare for all, and single-payer healthcare. The DSA’s strong stance on Palestinian liberation and its criticism of Israeli policy—especially following the October 7 Hamas attack—have become central to its identity and outreach.

The rise of other progressive candidates such as Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson reflects a broader trend of democratic socialist energy spreading beyond national politics into local races. Despite the DSA’s small size and internal tensions, the momentum suggests a fundamental realignment in how voters perceive the Democratic Party’s values and direction.",
