  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Palestinian solidarity activist, was detained in March 2025 for his activism at Columbia University and later released in June 2025 after a habeas corpus petition. The U.S. government has continued efforts to deport him, citing alleged concealment of UNRWA work and foreign policy concerns. Lawyers for Khalil, including those from the ACLU, argue that the government’s use of immigration law to target political speech violates constitutional protections, especially free speech. A prior federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s crackdown on such activists is unlawful, as it infringes on free expression. While Khalil’s release is currently in place, his full immigration case remains under appeal through the Board of Immigration Appeals and potentially to a circuit court, indicating that the legal battle is ongoing and raises broader concerns about the limits of immigration enforcement and free speech in the United States.",
