    "Kenny Loggins has requested that the audio of his song 'Danger Zone' be removed from a fake AI-generated video posted by President Donald Trump on Truth Social, which features a crown-wearing Trump in a fighter jet labeled 'KING TRUMP' dumping sludge over protesters in Times Square.",
    "The video, which appears to parody the 'No Kings' protests, uses the iconic 'Danger Zone' track, originally from the 1986 movie Top Gun, raising concerns about unauthorized use of copyrighted music for political messaging.",
    "Loggins, who performed the song, stated that he was not asked for permission and that such use is inappropriate, especially given the divisive nature of the content.",
    "While music copyright law generally allows such use unless rights holders are paid, performers can specifically prohibit use in political campaign advertisements — though Loggins is making a public appeal to promote unity and patriotism.",
    "This incident reflects a broader pattern of musicians objecting to political leaders using their music in misleading or inflammatory videos, with previous cases like those involving The White Stripes and Isaac Hayes setting precedent.",
    "The White House did not respond directly to Loggins' request, but shared a film still from Top Gun as a symbolic response.",
    "The controversy underscores growing tension between political satire, public perception, and intellectual property rights in the digital age."

The White House did not directly respond to the request but shared a Top Gun film still, suggesting a symbolic counterpoint to the controversy. The controversy arises from the intersection of political satire, public protests (No Kings), and intellectual property rights in the digital age.",
