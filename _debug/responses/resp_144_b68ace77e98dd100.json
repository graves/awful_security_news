    "The world is still expected to experience 57 additional superhot days per year by 2100 due to climate change, even with current Paris Agreement commitments.",
    "Before the Paris Climate Agreement, the world was on track for 114 extra superhot days annually due to a projected 4°C warming; this has been reduced to half due to current emission mitigation efforts.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days, indicating ongoing climate change impacts.",
    "The impact of climate change is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat exposure—Panama projected to gain 149 extra superhot days—despite contributing less than 1% of global carbon emissions.",
    "In contrast, top carbon emitters such as the United States, China, and India—responsible for 42% of global CO2 emissions—face only 23–30 extra superhot days, highlighting a profound climate injustice.",
    "The study underscores that climate change impacts will affect tens of thousands or millions of people annually, with thousands already dying in heatwaves each year.",
    "Experts like Johan Rockstrom and Andrew Weaver warn that the disparity in climate impacts could deepen global inequalities and potentially lead to geopolitical instability."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that, despite progress under the Paris Climate Agreement, the Earth will still experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat—compared to pre-2015 projections of 114. The report underscores a stark global inequality: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat exposure (e.g., Panama with 149 extra days), despite contributing only 1% of global carbon emissions, while major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days, despite being responsible for 42% of global CO2. Experts emphasize that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected, with heatwaves already causing thousands of annual deaths. This disparity raises serious concerns about climate justice and potential geopolitical instability.",
