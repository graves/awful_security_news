The protests, which erupted after a tragic childbirth incident in Agadir, have intensified as young people condemn government spending on new stadiums for the 2030 FIFA World Cup and the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations, asserting that such investments come at the expense of vital public services. Protesters chant slogans like 'Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?' and have called for a boycott of soccer events. The movement, organized on platforms like Discord, highlights deep societal inequalities, including disparities in education access and rural infrastructure, and has led to arrests, injuries, and violent clashes. Despite King Mohammed VI’s speech promoting balanced development, the lack of direct engagement with protest demands has fueled public skepticism, signaling a growing youth-led political movement challenging elite governance and social priorities.",
