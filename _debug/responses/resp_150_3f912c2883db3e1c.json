  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippine coast, thousands of residents in the island province of Catanduanes have evacuated due to warnings of coastal flooding and high winds. The storm brings heavy rainfall and waves up to 1.2 meters high, with the government weather service identifying a minimal to moderate flood risk. This event occurs amid a period of ongoing disaster recovery, following recent deadly earthquakes and typhoons, including a magnitude 6.9 and a magnitude 7.4 quake, as well as Typhoon Ragasa earlier in the month. The Philippines, which faces an average of 20 storms annually, is especially vulnerable due to its location and climate change-driven intensification of weather events. Regular evacuation drills in Catanduanes highlight the islandâ€™s recurring role as a first landfall point for western Pacific cyclones, underscoring both local resilience efforts and broader climate risks.",
