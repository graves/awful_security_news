  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, under President Donald Trump. The strike, the sixth in the region since September, targeted a vessel allegedly carrying narcotics and armed with 'narcoterrorists,' resulting in deaths and injuries to survivors. The US military detained the survivors, marking the first such detention under the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking. Legal questions arise over whether the president has constitutional authority to conduct lethal strikes and detain individuals without due process, especially as drug traffickers are traditionally treated as criminals. Colombia, in response, accused the US of violating its sovereignty by killing fisherman Alejandro Carranza in a prior strike, citing that he had no connection to drug trafficking. The US has deployed scores of military assets to the Caribbean, partly to pressure Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, and the situation raises significant diplomatic and legal concerns regarding the use of military force, due process, and international law.",
