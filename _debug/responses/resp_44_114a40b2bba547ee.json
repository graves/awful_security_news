  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage on Amazon Web Services (AWS) disrupted thousands of websites and online services globally on Monday, October 20, 2025, lasting several hours. The root cause appears to be a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from accessing AWS-hosted data and applications, even though the data itself remained safe. This outage underscores the fragility of the modern internet, which depends heavily on a few dominant cloud platforms like AWS. Experts note that such failures highlight a critical lack of redundancy and competitive alternatives, as the internet was originally designed to be decentralized and resilient. The incident echoes previous large-scale outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software bug and AT&T’s network failures, demonstrating how technical faults in key systems can lead to widespread global disruption and economic loss.",
