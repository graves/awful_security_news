  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Philadelphia, the remains of 23-year-old woman Kada Scott, who had been missing for about two weeks, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school. Authorities say the discovery was prompted by an anonymous tip that led them to re-examine the site. DNA tests confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possibly homicide. Evidence shows King’s cellphone was active in locations tied to Scott’s disappearance, and a stolen black Hyundai Accent was seen parked near the site on the evening of October 4, 2025. The car was later found on fire and destroyed at a junkyard. Prosecutors believe other individuals may have been involved after the fact and are still investigating. While King was previously arrested in a separate case, charges were dropped due to witness non-appearance. Scott’s parents described her as a source of kindness and light, and expressed deep grief over her disappearance.",
