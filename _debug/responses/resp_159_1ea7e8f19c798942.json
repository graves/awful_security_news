  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement to transfer asylum seekers to Belize, a move aligned with the Trump administration's effort to reduce asylum applications and increase deportations. While Belize claims it has safeguards including vetting, nationality restrictions, and a veto over transfers, critics—including opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton and human rights experts—argue the deal violates international law, exposes asylum seekers to dangerous conditions in countries like Eswatini and South Sudan, and risks turning Belize into a 'dumping ground'. The agreement requires Senate approval and faces significant domestic and international scrutiny, especially given past deportations that resulted in returns to home countries and documented abuses in places like El Salvador’s CECOT prison. The deal reflects a broader US strategy of using third-party nations to circumvent legal obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.",
