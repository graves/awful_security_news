  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in Pediatrics in 2025 finds that reversing the long-standing advice to avoid peanuts in infancy has significantly reduced food allergy rates in the U.S. The shift—driven by a landmark 2015 study (LEAP) showing that early peanut exposure reduces allergy risk—led to updated guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and inclusion in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Researchers analyzed health data from over 120,000 children and found a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergy rates, preventing at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergy in the last decade. Despite limitations, the study supports the effectiveness of early allergen introduction, a shift that has also helped reverse a decade-long rise in food allergies. Experts like Dr. David Hill and Dr. Corinne Keet emphasize both the promise and challenges of implementing these guidelines, noting that only about 10% of children with peanut allergies outgrow them, making prevention a critical public health advancement.",
