  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early peanut exposure in infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies by over 80%, new research shows that real-world implementation of early allergen introduction guidelines — first issued in 2015 and expanded in 2017 — has led to a significant decline in peanut allergy rates in U.S. children. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, found that peanut allergy diagnoses dropped by over 27% and over 40% after 2015 and 2017 respectively, with approximately 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies since 2015. Despite initial resistance from medical professionals and parents, adoption of the recommendations has increased, and the evidence now supports that early introduction of allergens like peanuts, milk, and soy between 4 and 6 months of age is both safe and effective. This shift, backed by scientific studies such as the LEAP trial led by Gideon Lack at King’s College London, represents a major public health advancement in allergy prevention.",
