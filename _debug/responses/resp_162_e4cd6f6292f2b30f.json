  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Human Rights Watch has released a report exposing how JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas. The report reveals that cattle from illegally deforested land are moved through a 'laundering' system—using state-approved transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual tracking—to obscure their origins and reach JBS facilities. This lack of traceability means JBS cannot verify the legality of its supply chain, raising serious ethical and environmental concerns. The state of Pará, which has seen a 421% surge in deforestation in 2024, is central to this issue, with illegal encroachments occurring in Indigenous territories like Cachoeira Seca and sustainable zones like Terra Nossa. Experts and advocacy groups argue that Brazil's current system of livestock tracking is insufficient and that stronger, enforceable reforms—such as making GTA data publicly accessible and enforcing earlier timelines—are urgently needed to stop illegal cattle ranching and protect both the environment and vulnerable communities.",
