  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A significant rise in subprime car loan delinquency—now at 6.43% since 2021—is a warning sign of economic instability in the U.S., with repossession rates reaching their highest levels since the Great Recession. This surge is driven by record car prices, high interest rates, rising repair and insurance costs, and the resumption of student loan payments. Unlike prime borrowers, who face minimal hardship, subprime borrowers with credit scores below 670 are deeply affected, often unable to meet payments due to overlapping financial obligations. The data from Fitch Ratings, Cox Automotive, and Experian reveals that nearly half of new and used car loans now have monthly payments of $500 or more, with 8% exceeding $1,000. Experts warn that if the labor market weakens, defaults and repossessions will likely increase further, highlighting a 'K-shaped economy' where wealthier consumers thrive while lower-income households face financial distress.",
