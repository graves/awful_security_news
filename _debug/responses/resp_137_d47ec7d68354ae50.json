  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October 2025 disrupted internet services globally, affecting key platforms such as Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Robinhood, Netflix, Disney+, Coinbase, and the McDonald’s app. The root cause was traced to a failure in AWS's domain name system, which converts web addresses into IP addresses. The outage began at 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and was reported to be recovering by 6 a.m., though full resolution took until midday. Experts note that such outages are typically due to technical issues, not cyberattacks, and are resolved within hours using established cloud infrastructure recovery protocols. This incident highlights the critical dependency of modern digital society on a small number of cloud providers, making widespread outages both common and highly disruptive to everyday online activities.",
