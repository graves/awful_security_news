  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) exhibit both social and architectural behaviors to combat a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants self-isolate and healthy ants—particularly nurses—increase their distance from foragers, showing proactive social distancing. Further research revealed that infected colonies modify their nest structures to become more compartmentalized, with longer travel routes and farther-spaced entrances, reducing interactions and slowing disease transmission. This combination of social and structural adaptations represents a form of 'architectural immunity' and is the first documented case of a non-human species actively altering its environment to combat disease. Scientists believe these findings could inspire new strategies for designing public spaces to reduce disease spread, suggesting that human architecture might learn from ant colonies to balance protection and functionality.",
