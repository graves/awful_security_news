  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has lifted a 38-plane-per-month production cap on Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft, which had been in place since January 2024, allowing Boeing to increase output to 42 planes per month. This decision follows a 2024 mid-air emergency involving an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 that was missing four key bolts, which triggered the initial safety-related production restrictions. The FAA conducted extensive safety reviews of Boeing’s production lines to ensure the increased output would not compromise quality or safety. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg confirmed the plan with FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, and the company is now preparing to begin full-scale production at the new rate. This development represents a major step in restoring confidence in Boeing’s manufacturing and safety protocols after a significant crisis.",
