  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Judge Michael Jesic has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole for the first time. The decision follows years of arguments over whether the brothers, who claim they were abused by their father and killed their parents in self-defense, should receive a reduced sentence. While both brothers took full responsibility and testified to remorse, prosecutors challenged their claims of abuse and self-defense, citing past lies and recent prison cell phone violations. Family members and prison staff testified to their rehabilitation, including participation in prison programs and support for victims. The brothers are now eligible for parole through the state parole board, with a scheduled hearing on June 13, and Governor Gavin Newsom retains the authority to approve or deny release. The case has broader implications for how society evaluates rehabilitation, the role of self-defense claims, and the balance between justice and mercy in long-term prison sentences.",
