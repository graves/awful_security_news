  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private business jet, a Mexican-registered Hawker 800XP with registration XA-JMR, crashed during a post-maintenance test flight in Lansing, Michigan, killing all three on board — two pilots and a maintenance representative. The crash occurred shortly after departure from Battle Creek Executive Airport at 5:08 PM, with the aircraft descending at a rate of up to 24,000 feet per minute. Air traffic control audio captures the pilots repeatedly calling out 'stall recovery,' indicating a possible loss of control. This incident mirrors a similar crash in February 2024 involving a Hawker 800XP during a stall warning system test flight, raising serious concerns about the safety of business jet operations and maintenance protocols. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation, and flight data from FlightAware and ADS-B Exchange support the timeline of the event. The aircraft had not flown since March 25, suggesting potential system or maintenance issues. Duncan Aviation, responsible for the maintenance, expressed support for the families and acknowledged the human impact of the tragedy.",
