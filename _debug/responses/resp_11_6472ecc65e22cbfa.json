  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s plans for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin may be stalled after a pre-meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was canceled due to divergent views on ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While Trump initially expressed optimism about a meeting within two weeks, the administration does not see a standalone Rubio-Lavrov meeting as a meaningful step, given Lavrov’s limited influence on actual policy decisions and his loyalty to Putin. A European diplomat noted Lavrov’s absence from key decision-making rooms, suggesting that real negotiations occur only with Putin. Despite this, the possibility of a future meeting between Rubio and Lavrov remains open, potentially at an ASEAN-led international gathering in Malaysia. The Kremlin maintains that the summit cannot be postponed as no date has been set, reinforcing urgency. Trump has repeatedly called for an immediate halt to hostilities in Ukraine, emphasizing a 'stop at the battle line' approach to peace.",
