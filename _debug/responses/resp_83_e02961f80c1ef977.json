  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the enduring cultural impact of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which remains a beloved and iconic romantic classic in India 30 years after its release. The film, directed by Aditya Chopra and starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, captured the spirit of 1990s India — a time of economic liberalization, cultural awakening, and a desire for balance between globalization and tradition. Its narrative, centered on a young couple navigating parental disapproval and cultural expectations, resonated deeply with audiences and became a blueprint for future Bollywood romance films. The film’s success helped launch the legendary Khan-Kajol on-screen pairing and influenced major films such as 'Pardes,' 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham,' and 'Kal Ho Naa Ho.' The Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai, which has shown DDLJ daily for nearly three decades, stands as a living monument to its popularity. While modern critics note dated gender politics and lack of personal ambition in Simran’s character, the film’s emotional authenticity, music, and cultural relevance continue to captivate new generations of viewers, especially young Indians and the diaspora, who see it as a timeless reflection of love, family, and identity.",
