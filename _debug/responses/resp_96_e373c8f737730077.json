  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is reviewing the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed Senate confirmation. The Justice Department argues that delegation of authority by the attorney general is a recognized and lawful practice, citing precedent where officials serve without confirmation. However, legal advocates like Abbe Lowell assert that full US attorney powers cannot be delegated, and that Habba’s appointment violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The case is part of a broader legal challenge involving other states, and Habba has attributed the appointment to congressional obstruction of nominations. The dispute raises critical questions about the balance between executive power and constitutional checks on federal appointments, with potential implications for how US attorneys are selected in future vacancies.",
