  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Admiral Alvin Holsey, the commander of U.S. Southern Command responsible for U.S. military operations in the Caribbean, is retiring at the end of 2025, one year after assuming office. His tenure has been marked by a public rift with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who criticized Holsey for not acting swiftly enough in combating drug trafficking, while Holsey expressed concerns about the legality of U.S. military strikes in the region, particularly off Venezuela’s coast. The article details a recent U.S. military strike that killed six people on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel, coinciding with President Donald Trump’s public authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela to stop drug and migrant flows. U.S. B-52 bombers also flew off Venezuela’s coast, indicating heightened military engagement. Tensions peaked during a Pentagon meeting on October 6, where Holsey offered to resign, though the announcement was delayed. The Pentagon denied that Holsey expressed reservations about the operations. Holsey, a 37-year veteran of the U.S. Navy with extensive command experience, will retire on December 12, 2025, after serving as commander of Southern Command since November 2024.",
