The heist is seen as part of a growing trend, echoed by previous thefts like the 2019 Green Vault robbery in Dresden and earlier thefts at Parisian museums. Experts believe the crime reflects a more aggressive, industrial-style 'grab-and-go' approach, possibly tied to organized crime like the Remmo clan. The French government and Interpol are now investigating, with officials expressing national concern over security failures and the long-term loss of cultural heritage.",
