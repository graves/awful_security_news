  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that climate change will lead to an additional 57 superhot days per year by 2100 under current global emissions commitments, down from 114 in the pre-Paris scenario. Since 2015, the world has already seen 11 extra superhot days annually. The report highlights a stark disparity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face massive increases in dangerous heat, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days, while top polluters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days despite emitting 42% of global CO2. Experts like Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto stress that the future remains perilous, and climate impacts will affect millions, with heatwaves already causing thousands of deaths annually. The findings underscore deep global inequities in climate change exposure, potentially threatening international stability.",
