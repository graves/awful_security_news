  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a government shutdown in October 2025, Capitol Police officers are working without pay, with their first full paycheck missed on October 10. The situation has drawn strong reactions from lawmakers, including Sen. Katie Britt, who blames Democrats for the impasse, and Rep. Joe Morelle, who criticizes the lack of negotiation and the legality of proposed funding solutions. Officers report high stress and morale issues due to both financial hardship and repeated public slights, such as the uninstalled Jan. 6 memorial plaque and confrontations with lawmakers like Rep. Nanette Barragán. Former Chief Terry Gainer and union chair Gus Papathanasiou emphasize that the officers are expected to be both aggressive enforcers and welcoming public figures, making their unpaid status and mistreatment a stark reminder of the human cost of political gridlock. While officers say they are holding up for now, one officer warns that morale could deteriorate significantly within a month.",
