  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) around 3:50 a.m. local time, crashing into the sea and killing two occupants of a nearby airport security patrol vehicle. The Boeing aircraft broke in two upon impact, with significant damage to its front and tail sections. All four crew members were treated and confirmed safe, with no cargo on board. The aircraft did not transmit any distress signals during approach, and the incident triggered a massive emergency response involving over 200 personnel. Operations on the north runway were suspended, though other runways remained operational, minimizing flight disruptions. The flight was under an Emirates flight number but wet-leased from ACT Airlines. This event underscores the rarity of such accidents at Hong Kong’s busy airport, despite historical challenges associated with previous airport locations like Kai Tak, where a major crash occurred in 1999.",
