  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "SpaceX and Cards Against Humanity have reached a settlement after a lawsuit over alleged trespassing and property damage on a Texas land plot. The land, purchased in 2017 as a protest against President Donald Trump’s border wall initiative, was reportedly used by SpaceX for construction without permission. Cards Against Humanity accused SpaceX of placing gravel and debris on the property, claiming it was treated as its own. SpaceX admitted to trespassing during discovery, and the company stated a trial would have cost more than it would have won. As a result, SpaceX removed construction equipment and the land is being restored. The settlement allows Cards Against Humanity to return funds to its 150,000 contributors who helped finance the land purchase, though the company noted they were likely to receive only a small return.",
