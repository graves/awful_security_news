  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Fengshen caused significant damage across the Philippines in October 2025, resulting in at least five deaths and two people missing. In Quezon province, a family of five was crushed to death when a tree fell on their bamboo house in Pitogo, while a teenage boy survived. Flooding affected multiple areas, including Luzon’s central islands of Samar and Panay, where residents evacuated and a man was injured. In Mindanao, a landslide in Bukidnon caused a vehicle to fall off a highway, blocking regional transportation. Over 47,000 people sought shelter, and five dams released water to mitigate flood risks. The storm coincided with the country’s recovery from a recent earthquake crisis, prompting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to stress the need for improved disaster preparedness due to the Philippines' high vulnerability to extreme weather, which scientists attribute to climate change.",
