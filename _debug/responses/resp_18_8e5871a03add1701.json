  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has offered expanded federal funding to nine universities—initially including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, and others—in exchange for adopting a series of ideological policy changes, such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment, and defining gender based on biological processes. Seven universities have formally rejected the proposal, citing deep concerns over academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House argues that the compact would foster a more ideologically balanced environment and provide funding advantages, but critics—including university leaders and academics—warn it undermines free inquiry, governance independence, and global academic excellence. A mandatory annual anonymous poll would ensure compliance, raising questions about transparency and enforcement. The proposal has sparked significant backlash, with institutions emphasizing their right to self-governance and the dangers of federal ideological intervention in higher education.",
