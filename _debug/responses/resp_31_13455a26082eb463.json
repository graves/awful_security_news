  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peruvian President Jose Jeri declared a 30-day state of emergency in Lima and the neighboring province of Callao on October 21, 2025, in response to a surge in crime and violent protests that left one person dead and over 100 injured. The emergency, approved by the Council of Ministers, allows for the deployment of armed forces and police to restore public order. This marks a new phase in Peru’s security strategy under Jeri, who took office after the ousting of former President Dina Boluarte. The decision is driven by growing public pressure, especially from young people in the so-called Generation Z, who are demanding urgent action. While Peru has previously declared similar emergencies—most notably under Boluarte in March 2025—analysts note that such measures have not substantially reduced crime, raising questions about their long-term effectiveness.",
