    "George Santos, a former Republican congressman from New York, was expelled from Congress in 2023 and served less than three months of a seven-year prison sentence for fraud and identity theft, including stealing identities of 11 people, including family members.",
    "Trump commuted Santos' sentence in 2025, releasing him immediately, calling the treatment of Santos 'horribly mistreated' and stating that Santos had 'the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN'.",
    "Santos admitted to lying about his education, employment history, and personal background, and misusing campaign funds for personal expenses such as Botox and OnlyFans subscriptions.",
    "The House ethics report found Santos had engaged in fraudulent practices, including misrepresenting his background and using campaign funds for personal benefits.",
    "Trump justified the commutation by criticizing Senator Richard Blumenthal over claims about his military service, arguing that Blumenthal's past misstatements were worse than Santos' crimes.",
    "Santos' case is notable as only the sixth member of Congress in history to be expelled, and the first such expulsion in over 20 years.",
    "Commutations do not erase criminal convictions, unlike pardons; Santos remains convicted of federal crimes, but is now released from prison.",
    "This action reflects broader political dynamics involving Trump’s use of executive power to pardon or commute criminal sentences of political figures, especially former Republican lawmakers."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major political and legal development, former Republican Congressman George Santos, expelled from Congress in 2023 for fraud, identity theft, and false statements about his background, was released from prison in October 2025 after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence. Santos, who admitted to stealing identities of 11 people—including family members—and misusing campaign funds for personal expenses like Botox and OnlyFans, was sentenced in April 2023 and served less than three months. Trump justified the commutation by criticizing Senator Richard Blumenthal over claims about his military service, calling it a more serious offense, and highlighted Santos' loyalty to the Republican Party. The move reflects a broader pattern of Trump pardoning or commuting sentences of former Republican lawmakers, without erasing criminal convictions. Santos previously wrote an open letter pleading for fairness and a chance to rebuild, acknowledging responsibility for his actions.",
