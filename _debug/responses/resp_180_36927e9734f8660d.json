  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New U.S. tariffs imposed under President Donald Trump, targeting imported kitchen cabinets, timber, furniture, steel, and copper, have significantly increased construction and renovation costs. These measures, which took effect in October 2025, are adding to an already weakened housing market, with experts warning that consumers will bear up to 55% of the cost. Homebuyers like Anthony Cabrera have already seen budgets balloon from $300,000 to $450,000 due to rising input prices. Major companies such as RH and IKEA have reported financial strain, with RH facing $30 million in new costs and IKEA warning of price hikes. Domestic design firms like Colony and Stillfried Design are also feeling the pinch, with price increases and reduced consumer spending. Economists argue that while the tariffs may not collapse the housing market, their cumulative effect—especially with planned increases in January—could harm affordability and slow new construction, particularly in low-margin affordable housing projects.",
