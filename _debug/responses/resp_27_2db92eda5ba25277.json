  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a meticulously planned seven-minute heist that occurred at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, October 19, 2025, thieves stole eight of nine high-value items from the Louvre’s French Crown Jewels, including pieces from Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense and Empress Eugénie. The robbers, believed to be four armed with angle grinders and a truck-mounted ladder, forced open a window in the Apollo Gallery, damaging the crown of Empress Eugénie and leaving behind one item. The attack, which occurred during the museum’s opening, prompted a full security evacuation and closure of the museum for investigation. No injuries were reported, and officials have not ruled out foreign involvement. Experts warn that thieves may melt down or recut stolen items to extract value, risking irreversible loss of cultural heritage. The incident marks the first such robbery at the Louvre in over a century, sparking global concern over the safety of priceless historical artifacts.",
