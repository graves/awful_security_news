  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and mental health providers are raising alarm over a policy shift within the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) system that restricts long-term one-on-one therapy sessions, particularly for veterans with chronic conditions like PTSD. The policy, intensified since 2021 under VA Secretary Doug Collins, mandates fixed session limits (typically 4–24) and limits provider discretion to extend care, even when patients need ongoing treatment. Providers report facing disciplinary action for challenging the policy, and some have resigned due to frustration. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell describe feeling abandoned and re-traumatized when therapy is abruptly ended. Critics argue that the policy undermines clinical judgment, violates shared decision-making, and fails to recognize the chronic nature of mental health conditions. While the VA denies such limits exist and claims care is personalized, providers and veterans say the system prioritizes volume over quality and trust. The American Psychological Association is investigating, underscoring broader concerns about access, equity, and the long-term well-being of veterans in need of sustained mental health care.",
