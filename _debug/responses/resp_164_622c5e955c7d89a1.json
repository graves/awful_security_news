    "The attack and trial have deepened political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming liberal opposition and media for inciting the attempt.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court in Banska Bystrica has sentenced 72-year-old poet Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, 2024, during a government meeting. The court classified the act as a 'terror attack' due to its political motivation, citing Cintula’s claim of moral despair and opposition to government decisions, including the halt of military aid to Ukraine. Cintula stated he wanted to protest, not kill, and accused Fico of abusing power and making decisions harmful to the country. The incident has deepened political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing liberal opposition and media of inciting violence, while critics argue his government has become increasingly authoritarian, including restricting media, cultural institutions, and advancing anti-EU and pro-Russian policies. The case has sparked national and international concern over democratic erosion and political extremism.",
