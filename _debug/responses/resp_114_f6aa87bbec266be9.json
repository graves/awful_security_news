  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a time of deep political division and a federal government shutdown, over 500 cancer survivors and advocates from across the U.S., including New York, united in Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress on cancer-related issues. Despite differing political affiliations—such as Mary Catherine Johnson, who voted for Trump, and Lexy Mealing, a Democrat—participants emphasized that cancer transcends party lines, with one volunteer noting, 'Cancer doesn't care.' The volunteers, many of whom had personal experiences with the disease, focused on three key priorities: increased funding for cancer research, retention of Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies, and expanded access to cancer screening. Though some Republican lawmakers resisted subsidy extensions, both parties supported increased research and screening. The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall with over 10,000 tea lights, each bearing a name of someone affected by cancer. This demonstrates how shared personal trauma can foster bipartisan unity and provide a powerful alternative to political polarization.",
