  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) early Monday, October 19, 2025, at approximately 3:50 a.m. local time, after landing from Dubai. The aircraft broke in two upon impact and collided with an airport security patrol vehicle, resulting in the deaths of two occupants. All four crew members were treated for injuries and are confirmed to be safe. There was no cargo on board, and the plane did not emit any distress signals prior to the crash. The airport suspended operations on the north runway for safety and recovery, while operations on the other two runways continued, minimizing disruption to over 1,000 daily flights. The flight was wet-leased from ACT Airlines, which also operates the aircraft. This incident, though rare at HKIA, underscores the importance of safety protocols and runway integrity, especially given the airport’s historical challenges and high traffic volume.",
