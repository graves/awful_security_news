  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article by CNN investigates the hidden realities behind 'made in Guatemala' clothing labels, revealing widespread labor exploitation in maquila factories. Workers—predominantly women—are subjected to long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and unsafe conditions, with minimal access to labor protections. Despite Guatemala’s garment sector contributing nearly 10% of its GDP and growing due to US nearshoring policies, the system is dominated by Korean-owned companies that control production and labor practices. US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren benefit from supply chains but are not legally accountable. Workers face severe retaliation for unionizing, including threats, violence, and job loss, and have little financial security, with many losing pensions upon factory closures. Though Guatemala’s new progressive president, Bernardo Arévalo, has pledged reforms, enforcement remains weak, and systemic abuse continues. The article underscores a global issue: the gendered and economic exploitation of women in global supply chains, especially in the face of political inaction and lack of accountability.",
