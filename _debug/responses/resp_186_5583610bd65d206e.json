    "The 'yellow line' in Gaza represents a temporary military boundary established under Donald Trump's peace plan, marking Israel's control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.",
    "The yellow line is the first of three stages in Israel's military withdrawal under the Trump peace plan, and its construction is seen as a strategic maneuver to balance domestic and international pressures.",
    "The boundary is meant to clearly demarcate territory, but may also blur expectations between Netanyahu’s far-right allies in Israel and his US allies, particularly in Washington.",
    "Washington, through US Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is urging Netanyahu to 'show restraint' and avoid breaking the ceasefire, especially after Hamas allegedly violated terms by killing soldiers.",
    "Netanyahu’s response to Hamas violations was limited to air strikes and a temporary reactivation of the ceasefire, emphasizing that attacks occurred within the yellow line to avoid violating US-imposed rules.",
    "Netanyahu insists that the war will not end until Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is completely demilitarized, which are key conditions he has set for peace.",
    "Israeli commentators argue that real military decisions are now being influenced by Washington, shifting power from Israeli domestic politics to US policy.",
    "The yellow line may become a de facto border if negotiations fail, enabling extremist settlers and hardline ministers to push for new settlements or even full annexation of Gaza.",
    "While many Israelis support an end to the war and the return of hostages and soldiers, Netanyahu's strategy of maintaining political flexibility and delaying final decisions is central to his leadership approach.",
    "Despite Trump and Netanyahu’s shared belief that the deal can be achieved 'the easy way,' Washington’s tolerance for delays and violations has given Netanyahu less room for maneuver than he might prefer."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump's peace plan, Israel has withdrawn its forces to a 'yellow line' marking control over about 53% of the Gaza Strip, establishing a temporary boundary that Israeli media and far-right allies have called the 'new border.' This move is part of a three-stage plan, with the second stage dependent on resolving Hamas disarmament and power transfer. While Netanyahu maintains that war will continue until Hamas is dismantled, US officials including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have urged restraint, warning against ceasefire violations. Israel responded to Hamas attacks with limited air strikes, emphasizing attacks occurred within the yellow line to avoid breaking US-imposed rules. The article suggests that US influence is now shaping military decisions, raising tension between Netanyahu’s domestic far-right coalition and international diplomacy. The yellow line may become a de facto border if negotiations fail, potentially enabling settlement expansion and annexation in Gaza, while the majority of Israelis desire an end to the war and the return of hostages and soldiers.",
