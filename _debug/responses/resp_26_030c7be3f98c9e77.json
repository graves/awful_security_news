She expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents on the ground to wear body-worn cameras during protests, citing concerns about the use of tear gas and pepper balls without prior warning. CBP agents in Chicago have cameras, but ICE Special Response Teams do not, and their equipment has not been issued due to administrative and funding issues. ICE agents are trained in crowd control and use of force, including the ability to issue citations. A pastor, Rev. David Black, reported being hit multiple times without warning while praying outside the Broadview detention facility. Federal leadership has been described as unstable with frequent personnel changes, and the White House has denied media reports of unapproved tear gas use. Judge Ellis plans to continue questioning top officials, including Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino, due to their direct oversight roles during the protests.",
