  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced that it would redirect tariff revenue—specifically from Section 32 and Section 232 tariffs—to fund the WIC program during the government shutdown, which began on October 1, 2025. With Congress failing to pass a spending bill for fiscal year 2026, WIC, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children, faced imminent closure. The White House, through Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, justified the move as a necessary intervention to protect vulnerable families, while legal experts and advocacy groups raised concerns about the legality and long-term sustainability of the plan. The National WIC Association emphasized the need for stable, long-term funding, not short-term fixes. Though the USDA provided up to $150 million in contingency funds and state-level rebates, the lack of congressional appropriation raises questions about the legality and effectiveness of the tariff reallocation. The situation has reignited bipartisan concern about the impact of political gridlock on essential social programs.",
