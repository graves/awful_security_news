  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced he would end all US financial payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to curb drug production, despite years of US funding. The move escalates a long-standing diplomatic rift over drug trafficking, migration, and military strikes in the Caribbean. Colombia, the world’s top cocaine producer, has been a key US ally, receiving around $210 million in aid this fiscal year. The conflict intensified after Petro accused the US of killing a Colombian national during a strike and after the US revoked his visa. In response, Petro criticized Trump, invoking Gabriel García Márquez’s novel 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' to highlight cultural and ideological differences. The US has conducted multiple military strikes on suspected drug vessels, with one strike resulting in the deaths of all crew and another resulting in two survivors being returned home. The crisis reflects a broader tension between US foreign policy, military intervention, and diplomatic sovereignty in Latin America.",
