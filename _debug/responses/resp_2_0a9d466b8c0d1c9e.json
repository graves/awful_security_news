  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, with over 50 drones targeting facilities in a single night. These attacks, repeated over 15 days, are part of a deliberate strategy to inflict cold and terror on civilians. Ukrainian officials attribute the attacks to a new tactic of drones circling damaged sites, making repairs unsafe and prolonging the humanitarian crisis. In response, Ukraine launched retaliatory missile strikes on Russian facilities, including the Bryansk Chemical Plant. President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging European allies for urgent assistance, including air defense systems and financial support, as Ukraine remains chronically short of military capabilities. The European Union is exploring the use of frozen Russian assets—worth $200 billion—as a loan to fund Ukraine’s defense and recovery. Meanwhile, concerns grow over a potential peace summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, a close ally of Putin, while analysts note a pattern of Russian escalation when Western leaders like Trump show frustration. Despite these challenges, Zelensky maintains that Ukraine remains the only serious party committed to peace and that even in dire situations, Ukraine will not be defeated.",
