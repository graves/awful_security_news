  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced 72-year-old Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. The attack, which wounded Fico severely, was classified as terrorism by the Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica, based on the targeted nature of the act and Cintula's stated opposition to Fico's policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. Cintula, a former mine worker and public activist, claimed he did not intend to kill, but the court found that the attack constituted a terrorist act due to its political intent. The verdict intensified national debates over political polarization, democratic standards, and the role of populist leadership. Fico, who returned to power in 2023, has faced criticism for policies perceived as undermining freedoms, while opposition groups accuse him of eroding democratic norms. Despite the conviction, Cintula expressed intent to appeal, and Fico has publicly forgiven the suspect, underscoring the complex emotional and political aftermath of the incident.",
