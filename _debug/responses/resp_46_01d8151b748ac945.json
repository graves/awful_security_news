  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article by CNN investigates exploitative labor conditions in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas. Workers—mostly women—face dangerous working hours, low wages (less than $500/month), threats, sexual harassment, and wage theft. Many are employed by Korean-owned factories like KOA Modas and Sae-A Trading, which supply US brands such as Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Despite formal regulations, unions are suppressed, and labor inspectors are blocked from entering factories. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra have shared stories of physical, emotional, and financial trauma, including job loss and lack of severance. A union leader, Corina Olivares, took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was murdered, highlighting the dangers of labor activism. The Guatemalan government, under President Bernardo Arévalo, has raised the minimum wage and pledged reform, but enforcement remains weak. The article underscores systemic issues in global supply chains, where US brands benefit from low-cost production without accountability, while workers—especially women—face extreme vulnerability and lack of protection.",
