  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, centered on Trump’s threat of imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and China’s retaliatory export controls on rare earth metals. This comes as both nations prepare for a high-stakes meeting in South Korea, with experts suggesting China's actions are strategic pre-emptive moves. The history of US trade measures, including tariffs from 2018 onward and export controls on semiconductors and tech firms like Huawei and TikTok, is reviewed. China claims the US has engaged in 'double standards' and national security abuse, while the US asserts it has the leverage and broader economic base to withstand pressure. Experts note that while China has been more organized in its response, both sides are retaining escalation tools, and the outcome will depend on global economic reactions and diplomatic will, not just negotiations.",
