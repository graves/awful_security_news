  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A historic preservation group, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has urged the Trump administration to pause the demolition of the White House East Wing, which is being torn down to make way for a $200 million privately funded ballroom. The East Wing, which includes historically significant spaces like the first lady’s offices and a 1942-era wood-paneled foyer, is being removed without a required public review process. Preservationists argue that the proposed 90,000-square-foot addition would overwhelm the existing 55,000-square-foot structure and disrupt its classical design. The National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts have previously reviewed similar White House projects and are now called upon to assess the ballroom proposal. The Society of Architectural Historians has also expressed concern, emphasizing the need for a rigorous, deliberate process. While the White House has not responded to preservation groups’ letters, it has released a list of past renovations, including Truman-era wing construction and Ford’s swimming pool, to illustrate a historical pattern of modifications to the executive residence.",
