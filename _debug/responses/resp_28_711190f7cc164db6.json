The decision comes amid advocacy from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has criticized corn syrup. While the soda is currently available in select cities and retailers, it reflects a broader trend at Coca-Cola toward healthier products, including the successful growth of sugar-free sodas like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and relaunched brands such as BodyArmor and Smartwater. Health experts note that sugary sodas—regardless of sweetener—remain unhealthy, and the move signals a response to political influence and shifting consumer preferences.",
