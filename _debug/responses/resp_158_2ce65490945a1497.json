  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly contributing to illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas in Pará. The report details a systemic failure in traceability: cattle raised on illegally deforested land are transferred through a 'laundering' system using aggregate transit permits (GTAs), which do not track individual animals. This lack of traceability allows JBS to remain unaware of the illegal origins of its beef and leather products. The situation is exacerbated by illegal land encroachment in protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where cattle are transported with the approval of Pará’s state agency, Adepará. Despite JBS’s past commitments—such as its 2009 pledge to identify all indirect suppliers—the company has not fulfilled them. Experts and advocacy groups argue that only mandatory, government-led traceability systems and public access to data can effectively stop deforestation. While new policy initiatives in Pará and at the federal level aim to track animal movements by 2026 and 2032 respectively, these timelines are deemed too slow and insufficient to address the scale of illegal activity.",
