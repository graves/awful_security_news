  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, sparked by President Donald Trump’s threat of imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China justifies its actions as a defense of national security and a reaction to US targeting of Chinese industries, while the US claims it is enforcing fair trade principles. Historical patterns of tit-for-tat tariffs, such as those from 2018 to 2020 and under President Biden, show a recurring cycle of economic retaliation. Experts highlight that both nations are weaponizing economic interdependence under the guise of national security, with rare earths and semiconductors serving as strategic chokepoints. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea adds urgency to the situation, with experts suggesting that neither side is willing to back down. The article concludes that while the US has broader global influence, China has shown more strategic coordination in its economic responses, and the outcome will depend on how markets and global economies react to sustained pressure.",
