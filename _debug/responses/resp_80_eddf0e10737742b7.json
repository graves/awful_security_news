  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions—particularly in the Donbas region—to end the war, contrary to earlier claims that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. The meeting, described as tense and marked by raised voices, stemmed from Trump’s belief that the conflict should end at current battle lines due to the devastation and loss of life. While Trump denied asking for surrender of the entire Donbas, he reiterated that a ceasefire should be established where fighting currently exists, aligning with a broader shift in his peace approach. This shift comes after Trump brokered a Gaza ceasefire and is influenced by a Russian proposal involving territorial swaps. Zelensky described the exchange as pointed but constructive, with the meeting potentially advancing progress toward a ceasefire, though deep disagreements remain over the future of Ukrainian territory.",
