  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals the exploitative working conditions in Guatemalan maquila garment factories, which supply clothing to major US brands like Target, Ralph Lauren, and Carhartt. Despite the sector contributing nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, workers—mostly women—face brutal conditions: long hours, low wages (as low as $500/month), sexual harassment, wage theft, and threats of violence. Korean-owned companies control a majority of investments, and US brands benefit through subcontracting without legal responsibility for labor practices. Workers are often denied pensions, severance, or union rights, and union leaders face threats, including the murder of a predecessor. Government inspections are blocked, and enforcement remains weak. While President Bernardo Arévalo’s government has raised the minimum wage and pledged reform, systemic power imbalances and resistance from factory owners limit progress. The article highlights a gendered supply chain crisis, where women are disproportionately affected by exploitation, and calls for greater accountability and reform in global fashion supply chains.",
