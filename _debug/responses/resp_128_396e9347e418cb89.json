    "The North Atlantic right whale population has increased to an estimated 384 individuals, up from 376 in the previous year, showing a positive trend after a decade of decline.",
    "The recovery is attributed to improved conservation measures, including new management actions in Canada and better protection in key habitats like the Gulf of St. Lawrence.",
    "Despite positive signs, the population still faces threats from ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear, which remain major causes of mortality.",
    "A key positive development is that four mother whales produced calves in the current year, with shorter intervals between births among established mothers — signs of improving reproductive health.",
    "Only 11 calves were born this year, below researchers’ hopes, but the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is a hopeful sign.",
    "Scientists remain cautious, noting that the population remains fragile and vulnerable, and that continued protection under laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act is essential.",
    "Environmental groups urge Congress to protect existing laws and scientific safeguards to prevent further decline and ensure long-term recovery."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown signs of recovery, with an estimated 384 individuals in 2025 — an increase of eight from the previous year. After a 25% decline from 2010 to 2020 due to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements, scientists report a slow but steady recovery. Key developments include four mother whales producing calves and shorter birth intervals among established mothers, indicating improved reproductive health. Despite this progress, threats remain, and only 11 calves were born this year, below expectations. Scientists and conservation groups stress the importance of sustained protection, especially under laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and urge Congress to uphold environmental safeguards to prevent further decline. New management measures in Canada, particularly in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, are cited as especially vital in supporting this fragile recovery.",
