  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "At China’s fourth plenum in October 2025, Xi Jinping is convening a high-level political meeting to chart the country’s next five-year economic strategy (2026–2030), emphasizing technological innovation in AI, quantum computing, and new energy amid rising geopolitical friction with the United States. The meeting comes at a critical time as China faces slowing economic growth—down to 4.8% in Q3 2025—due to overcapacity, deflation, and a property market slump, while simultaneously undergoing a sweeping anti-corruption purge within the military and party leadership, including the removal of top-ranking general He Weidong. The plenum may result in significant personnel reshuffles within the Central Committee and Central Military Commission, reinforcing Xi’s centralized control. Despite domestic economic challenges, observers expect China to maintain its current strategic course with targeted adjustments, such as boosting domestic consumption and addressing overcapacity. The timing of the meeting, just before a potential U.S.-China meeting involving Donald Trump in South Korea, adds international tension and underscores the strategic competition between the two global powers.",
