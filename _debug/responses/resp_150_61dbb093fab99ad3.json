  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in October 2025 that there is a link between autism and circumcision, citing two studies — one from 2013 and one from 2015 — and an unpublished 2025 preprint from WPLab that claims acetaminophen triggers autism. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, state that these studies show only weak, correlational associations, not causal links. The 2013 study had no data on acetaminophen use and was limited by small sample sizes and demographic confounding. The 2015 Danish study found a slight increase in autism risk among circumcised boys but was based on extremely small samples and did not examine drug use. The 2025 WPLab paper is a preprint not peer-reviewed and misrepresents the evidence. Mainstream medical consensus affirms that acetaminophen is safe for infants and that no credible research supports a link to autism. Kennedy’s claims are widely regarded as scientifically unfounded and potentially harmful to public health, especially given his history of making similar false claims about pharmaceuticals.",
