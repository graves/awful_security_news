  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has called for urgent global improvements in early-warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of all countries lack such systems—particularly in developing nations where disaster-related deaths are six times higher. Over 2 million people have died from weather, water, and climate-related hazards in the past 50 years, with 90% of those deaths in developing countries. While global monitoring has improved, with 108 countries now using some form of early warnings (up from 52), half still have only basic capacity. The situation is most dire in conflict-affected and fragile regions. Progress is being seen in Africa, and real-world successes—such as the evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, in May 2025 due to a predicted glacier collapse—demonstrate the life-saving potential of timely alerts. The WMO emphasizes that early warning enables early action, and with climate change intensifying weather extremes, such systems are essential for protecting lives and infrastructure worldwide.",
