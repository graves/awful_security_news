  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration’s Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approached, a growing number of institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia—publicly rejected the proposal. The Compact, which includes provisions such as banning transgender students from using restrooms or playing sports aligned with their gender identity, freezing tuition, limiting international enrollment, and mandating standardized tests, was criticized by academic leaders as violating core principles of scientific merit, academic integrity, and research autonomy. Despite White House efforts to engage universities in discussions, including a virtual meeting with several institutions, no schools ultimately agreed to sign. The resistance reflects broader tensions between federal political agendas and academic independence, especially in the context of the administration’s past cancellations of research grants over issues like diversity, equity, and transgender policies.",
