  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Christopher Moynihan, a man pardoned by former President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, has been arrested and charged with making a credible death threat against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Moynihan allegedly planned to target Jeffries during a speech at the Economic Club of New York, with text messages expressing a clear intent to kill him. He was previously sentenced to 21 months in prison for breaching the Capitol and taking photos of lawmakers. The incident underscores the ongoing concern over political violence in the U.S., especially after the pardoning of rioters. This case is relevant not only because of the threat itself but also because it reflects broader criticism of the Trump administration’s pardon policy, which has enabled former rioters to reoffend. The case also places Moynihan in a broader context of rising political violence in 2025, including the killing of Charlie Kirk in Utah and the attack on Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota.",
