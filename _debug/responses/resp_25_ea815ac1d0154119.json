  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, specifically focusing on the case of Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for marijuana and cocaine use and possession of a 9mm pistol. The case raises a critical constitutional question about the Second Amendment, as the government defends the law as a necessary measure to prevent danger from habitual drug users, particularly during impaired encounters with law enforcement. The Trump administration argues that such users pose a grave societal risk and cites alleged ties to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and a 2020 celebration of Qasem Soleimani’s death. However, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that such a ban lacks historical precedent, and a federal district court dismissed the charge on that basis. The case is notable not only for its constitutional implications but also because of the involvement of Hunter Biden, who was convicted under the same law and later pardoned. With arguments expected in 2026 and a decision likely by the end of June, the ruling could reshape how drug use and gun ownership are regulated in the U.S.",
