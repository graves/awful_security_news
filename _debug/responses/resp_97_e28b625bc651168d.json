  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Podcast host Joe Rogan expresses surprise at the scale and brutality of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which he describes as a stark departure from what he expected—despite Trump’s long-standing campaign promises. While public polling initially suggested most Americans expected Trump to pursue actions such as mass deportations, tariffs, and investigations into political opponents, data now shows that many, including independents and Republicans, believe he is exceeding his campaign promises. Polls indicate that only a fraction of Americans predicted Trump would take such aggressive actions—especially in cases like pardoning violent January 6 defendants or launching broad deportations. A significant number of Americans now believe Trump’s actions are worse than expected, with a Pew Research Center poll showing that 48% think his behavior exceeds what they anticipated. This suggests that while Trump’s policies were seen as plausible, their execution has surpassed expectations and generated public unease, signaling a growing disconnect between campaign rhetoric and actual governance, and indicating that Rogan is not alone in being surprised.",
