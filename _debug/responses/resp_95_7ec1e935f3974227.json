  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the global attention and perceived success of a recent Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by President Donald Trump, domestic public opinion has remained largely unimpressed. Polls from AP-NORC and CNBC show that while Trump's approval on the Gaza issue slightly improved, his overall approval rating has dropped to a near-term low, with strong disapproval on economic issues such as inflation, rising costs, and job insecurity. Americans express deep skepticism about the deal’s durability, reflecting broader fatigue with foreign policy successes. Meanwhile, economic pessimism is on the rise, with declining expectations for wage growth and economic recovery, and a majority of Americans believe Trump has not prioritized lowering prices. These findings suggest that, in the eyes of the public, domestic economic issues—especially inflation and job stability—outweigh foreign policy achievements, reinforcing the idea that 'it’s the economy, stupid' remains a dominant political narrative.",
