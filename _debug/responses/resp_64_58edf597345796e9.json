The new ballroom, designed with gold and neoclassical features, will be built adjacent to the former East Wing, where first ladies traditionally held offices. The project is funded by Trump and private donors, and reflects his broader effort to personalize and modernize the White House, including using gold decor and altering public spaces like the Rose Garden.
