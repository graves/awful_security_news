  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northeastern Nigeria, particularly in Borno State, farmers face life-threatening dangers from Boko Haram and ISWAP militant groups, who have intensified attacks on agricultural communities. Despite government efforts to re-integrate displaced people into farming through the Agro Rangers program — a security unit under the NSCDC — many farmers remain traumatized and fearful, with reports of kidnappings, ransom extortion, and killings. The number of targeted attacks on farmers has more than doubled since 2024, with violence reaching its highest level in five years by mid-2025. While officials like Mohammed Hassan Agalama and James Bulus claim progress due to increased harvests and security presence, critics including the International Crisis Group warn that the reintegration policy is putting displaced farmers at greater risk. Farmers such as Aisha Isa, Mustapha Musa, and Baba Modu express deep anxiety about returning to farming, citing constant threats, lack of safety, and the loss of loved ones. The article highlights the urgent need for more robust, sustainable security measures and a more cautious, community-centered approach to agricultural recovery in conflict-affected regions.",
