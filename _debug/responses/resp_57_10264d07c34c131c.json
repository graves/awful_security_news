  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the hidden exploitation within Guatemalan maquila factories, where workers—overwhelmingly women—face long hours, unsafe conditions, wage theft, and sexual harassment. Despite being vital to Guatemala’s economy and supplying clothing for major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, these workers lack labor protections. Korean companies dominate investments and operations, and US brands benefit without legal accountability. Union activity is met with threats, violence, and dismissals, as seen in the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra endure financial devastation and emotional trauma, with many forced into precarious jobs after layoffs. Although Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo’s administration has promised reform, enforcement remains weak due to factory resistance and lack of political will. The article underscores a global supply chain issue where consumer demand enables exploitation, particularly of women, and calls for greater transparency and accountability in fashion and apparel production.",
