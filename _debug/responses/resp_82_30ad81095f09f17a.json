The attack caused severe injuries, including a broken arm and leg wounds requiring multiple surgeries. This incident is part of a growing trend of bear attacks in Japan, with over 100 injuries and seven deaths reported this year, linked to climate change disrupting bears’ traditional food sources and forcing them into human habitats. In response, the Japanese government has announced tougher bear control measures. Residents are advised to use deterrents like bear spray or loud sounds, and Halloran, despite trauma and long-term recovery, remains determined to return to running and nature, highlighting both personal resilience and the broader environmental crisis.",
