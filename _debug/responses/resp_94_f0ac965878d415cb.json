Xi has intensified his anti-corruption campaign, resulting in the removal of top military officials including General He Weidong, signaling tighter control over the armed forces and political apparatus. The plenum may include key personnel reshuffles, potentially marking the most significant shake-up since 2017. Experts suggest that while the policy direction will remain largely unchanged, there could be targeted adjustments to boost consumption and address domestic competition. This event underscores the strategic competition between China and the U.S. in technology and trade, and highlights Xi’s enduring authority over China’s political and economic future.",
