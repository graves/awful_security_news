  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman reported missing after an overnight shift at an assisted living facility, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia. The discovery was prompted by an anonymous tip that led investigators to re-examine the area. DNA testing confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and causing or risking a catastrophe. His cellphone data and video footage show his vehicle, a stolen black Hyundai Accent, being parked near the site where Scott’s body was found. The car was later burned at a junkyard. Prosecutors say more charges may be filed and that others may have been involved. King was previously arrested in a separate case, with charges dropped due to non-appearance of key witnesses. District Attorney Larry Krasner confirmed that homicide charges are likely, emphasizing legal process and constitutional standards.",
