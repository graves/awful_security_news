  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and mental health providers across the U.S. are raising alarms over the VA’s recent policy to limit long-term one-on-one therapy sessions, particularly under the leadership of VA Secretary Doug Collins since 2021. Veterans like Michael, a combat veteran with PTSD, report feeling abandoned when therapy ends abruptly, even when they are not ready to transition to alternative care. Providers say they face disciplinary consequences for extending sessions beyond mandated limits, and many have resigned in protest. The policy, which restricts therapy to a fixed number of sessions (typically 4–24), contradicts clinical best practices, as many mental health conditions, especially PTSD and chronic depression, require lifelong treatment. The American Psychological Association has acknowledged the issue and is investigating. Veterans argue that such limits re-traumatize them and undermine trust in care, while the VA maintains that no such limits exist and that care is tailored to individual needs through shared decision-making.",
