  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under a US-brokered ceasefire agreement that began on 10 October 2025, Hamas has delivered a body it claims is a missing Israeli hostage, which the Israeli military has confirmed will be returned for identification. The agreement includes the return of 15 Palestinian bodies for every Israeli hostage's remains, with Israel having already released 250 prisoners and 1,718 detainees. However, tensions persist as Israel accuses Hamas of violating the truce through attacks in Rafah and Shejaiya, resulting in at least 45 Palestinian deaths. The ceasefire remains fragile, with both sides accusing each other of breaches, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) continuing to enforce control over Gaza, including marking the Yellow Line. The conflict originated in the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, which killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Since then, at least 68,216 people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas-run health ministry, a figure recognized by the UN. US officials, including former President Donald Trump and envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have been involved in monitoring and reinforcing the truce.",
