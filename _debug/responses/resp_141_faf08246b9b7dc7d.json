  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current climate commitments, the world will still see 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of extreme heat — due to climate change. This represents a significant decline from the 114 superhot days predicted under a worst-case warming scenario of 4°C. The study highlights a stark global inequity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face massive increases in dangerous heat days — up to 149 extra days per year — despite contributing only 1% of global carbon emissions. In contrast, top emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra superhot days. Experts emphasize that while the Paris Agreement has reduced the worst-case warming trajectory, the future still poses severe risks for billions, and the disproportionate burden on vulnerable nations may fuel social and geopolitical instability.",
