  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for marijuana use and firearm possession. The Trump administration defends the law, claiming habitual drug users pose risks to public safety and national security, citing alleged ties to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and travel to celebrate Qasem Soleimani’s death. However, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that the law cannot target habitual users, only those under the influence at the time of arrest, and a federal district court dismissed Hemani’s charge under a 2022 Supreme Court precedent that requires gun prohibitions to have historical roots. Hemani’s legal team argues that the law lacks historical legitimacy and that many states have legalized marijuana. The case, which will be heard in 2026, is significant because it challenges the scope of the Second Amendment and raises broader questions about the balance between public safety and constitutional rights. The case also draws attention due to the prior conviction of Hunter Biden under the same law, adding political dimensions to the debate.",
