  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the body of deceased Israeli soldier and hostage Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, who was killed on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack. Haimi, aged 41, is the 13th such hostage to be returned and identified under the US-proposed ceasefire deal signed on October 9, 2025. The return of his remains, after being retrieved by the Red Cross in Gaza, marks a critical step in the humanitarian phase of the ceasefire. However, challenges remain, including Hamas’s inability to recover all deceased hostages due to war-related destruction and one confirmed case of misidentification. Israeli authorities have called on Hamas to return all bodies, while US officials, including President Donald Trump and envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have emphasized enforcement of the agreement, threatening strong action if violations occur. The situation reflects ongoing diplomatic tensions, with Israel demanding fulfillment of the ceasefire’s human rights commitments and international actors pushing for accountability.",
