  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline approached for universities to accept the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education, six out of nine institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia—declined to sign. These rejections stem from concerns that the compact undermines academic integrity, scientific merit, and equitable access to education. MIT and other leaders argued that the compact's policies, such as banning transgender students from sports and restrooms and mandating standardized testing, conflict with core academic values. The White House held a virtual meeting to discuss the proposal, but the lack of consensus among universities suggests that the policy faces strong resistance from academia. This reflects a broader conflict between federal political agendas and institutional independence in higher education, particularly over issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and research funding.",
