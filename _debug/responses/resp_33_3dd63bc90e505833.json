  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, following the establishment of rare ceasefire zones between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The plant has been without off-site power for four weeks—its longest blackout since the war began—forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that repair efforts have begun after negotiations with both sides, with IAEA Director Rafael Grossi stressing the importance of power restoration for nuclear safety. Ukraine accuses Russia of intentionally cutting power to test reconnection, while Russia blames Ukrainian shelling. Both sides claim to have played a key role in enabling the repair work, with Russia asserting that its defense ministry provided security guarantees. This incident follows a previous Russian strike on a Slavutych energy substation, which caused a blackout at the former Chernobyl site and raised regional radiation safety concerns. The situation underscores the risks of military aggression on critical energy and nuclear infrastructure, and highlights the fragile balance of ceasefire zones in a war zone.",
