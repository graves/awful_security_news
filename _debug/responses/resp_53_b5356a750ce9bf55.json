  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary investigation by Portugal’s Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) found that a steel cable in the Glória funicular in Lisbon failed to meet safety specifications set by its operator, CARRIS, and was not certified for passenger use. This cable snapped shortly after the funicular cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, resulting in a derailment that killed at least 16 people and injured others. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the event as chaotic, with a loud bang and a cloud of brown smoke. The investigation also revealed serious lapses in maintenance, with tasks falsely marked as completed and the maintenance plan falsely deemed compliant. While the findings are preliminary and not conclusive, they highlight systemic failures in safety oversight and infrastructure management, raising urgent concerns about public transport safety in Portugal.",
