  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage on October 21, 2025, disrupted critical services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global concerns about over-reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. With both AWS and Microsoft Azure dominating the UK cloud market—each holding 30–40% share—the incident highlighted a 'nested dependency' where even services not directly hosted on a cloud platform are vulnerable. Experts warn that assuming these companies are resilient is a mistake, pointing to systemic fragility and geopolitical risks. While US dominance offers economies of scale, cost savings, and security, it also creates national vulnerability. The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended designating Amazon and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition. Experts and policymakers now advocate for political action, including mandatory data resilience standards and the use of multiple cloud providers, to diversify the UK's digital infrastructure and strengthen national resilience.",
