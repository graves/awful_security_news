  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, 38, to a prison term of five years to life for raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. Despite claiming to be dead and using aliases such as Arthur Knight and falsely linking himself to Brown University, Rossi was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit and apprehended in Scotland in 2024 after being recognized by hospital staff. He was extradited to Utah and convicted in two separate trials, with prosecutors arguing he was a flight risk and a serial abuser. The victims described years of emotional, financial, and physical abuse, including coercion to pay for dates and debt, and expressed a plea for accountability and safety. Rossi maintained his innocence, but the judge ruled he poses a danger to the public and should serve a long prison term. This case underscores the importance of DNA backlogs, international cooperation, and the enduring trauma of sexual assault.",
