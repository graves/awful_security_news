  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, affecting thousands of online services including banking, social media, shopping, and airline booking platforms. The root cause was a failure in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from accessing data stored in DynamoDB and other services like EC2. While AWS is generally reliable, this incident—similar to past outages such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software bug and AT&T’s network failures—demonstrates the fragility of the internet when reliant on a few centralized cloud providers. Experts note that the internet was originally designed to be decentralized and resilient, but today’s heavy concentration of services in platforms like AWS makes the system vulnerable to cascading failures. The outage lasted several hours, with restoration completed by 6:35 AM ET, and AWS is expected to release a detailed postmortem to explain the technical cause.",
