  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and mental health providers are raising serious concerns about the VA's policy of limiting one-on-one therapy sessions for veterans, particularly those with chronic conditions like PTSD. The policy, intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins since 2021, mandates a fixed number of sessions (often 8–12) without patient or provider input, leading to staff resignations, re-traumatization, and a sense of abandonment among veterans. While some providers acknowledge that shorter-term care may be useful for certain cases, many argue that mental health conditions, especially those stemming from combat trauma, require long-term, individualized support. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell report feeling abandoned when therapy is abruptly ended, and some providers feel they are being punished for advocating for more appropriate care. The American Psychological Association has acknowledged the reports and is investigating, emphasizing that recovery-oriented, shared decision-making care should be the standard. The VA denies that limits exist, claiming care is individualized and patient-centered, but on-the-ground experiences suggest a significant disconnect between policy and practice.",
