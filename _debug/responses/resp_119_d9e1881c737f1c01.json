  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education looms, a growing number of elite institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, the University of Virginia, and Dartmouth College—have publicly rejected the agreement. The compact, which requires schools to enforce gender-based restroom and sports policies, freeze tuition, limit international enrollment, and require standardized testing, is seen as a politically driven effort to align higher education with conservative policy priorities. Academic leaders argue that such conditions undermine scientific research, academic merit, and institutional integrity. Despite White House outreach and negotiations with institutions like UVA and Dartmouth, the resistance remains strong, signaling a broader conflict between federal political influence and academic independence in U.S. higher education.",
