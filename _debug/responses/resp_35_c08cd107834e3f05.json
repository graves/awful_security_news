While publicly expressing optimism, Vance avoided setting deadlines for Hamas disarmament or the return of hostages, emphasizing the need for time to implement security and humanitarian measures. The visit coincides with heightened tensions after an alleged Hamas attack killing two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli airstrikes and accusations of violations from both sides. US officials, including Witkoff and Kushner, stress the urgency of the next 30 days for the ceasefire to hold and for talks to advance. Trump has publicly questioned Hamas’s leadership role in the attack, described it as a 'rebellion,' and threatened to 'eradicate' the group if necessary, while suggesting regional allies might enter Gaza to address ongoing threats. Despite these tensions, both Israel and Hamas have reaffirmed their commitment to the ceasefire, highlighting the fragile but ongoing nature of the truce.",
