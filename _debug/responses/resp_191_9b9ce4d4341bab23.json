  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As drone technology becomes cheaper and more accessible, nations and private companies are facing growing threats to critical infrastructure. The article highlights how anti-drone technologies such as electronic jamming (used by MyDefence), low-cost interceptors (developed by Nordic Air Defence), and detection systems (including acoustic sensors and advanced radar) are being rapidly developed. Demand has shifted from military to civilian users, especially in sectors like shipping and energy, due to real-world incidents in countries like Poland, Romania, and Germany. Experts emphasize that cost is a major issue: it's now unacceptable to defend against low-cost drones with extremely expensive countermeasures. Solutions include soft-kill methods like hacking, safe landing control, and a proposed global drone traffic management system with electronic license plates. The war in Ukraine has been a key driver of innovation in both drone use and defense, pushing for affordable, scalable, and effective countermeasures across NATO and beyond.",
