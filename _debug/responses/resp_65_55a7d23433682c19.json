    "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was indicted in Maryland on October 16, 2025, on 18 counts: eight for transmission and 10 for retention of national defense information classified up to TOP SECRET.",
    "Bolton allegedly kept and shared over a thousand pages of diary-like notes containing classified information, including from secure White House environments, using personal email accounts (such as AOL and Google) and storing them on personal devices.",
    "The indictment claims Bolton transmitted classified information to family members who had no security clearance and failed to disclose his email account was hacked by Iran in 2021.",
    "The FBI investigation into Bolton began in 2021 under the Biden administration, not during Trump's second term, despite political claims that the charges are politically motivated.",
    "Bolton has claimed the charges are politically driven, calling them part of a broader effort by Trump's Justice Department to target political opponents, and that the case is an example of the weaponization of federal law.",
    "Trump, who was at a press event on IVF drug pricing when the indictment was released, called Bolton 'a bad guy' and said, 'that’s the way it goes, right?'",
    "The case is being handled by U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed by Barack Obama in 2014, and has maintained support from career prosecutors and investigators, distinguishing it from politically charged cases like those involving Comey or James.",
    "Legal experts note this case may be more serious than previous classified information cases due to the active dissemination of top-secret material to unsecured family members and the failure to disclose the Iran hack."
