  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political divisions in the U.S., more than 500 cancer survivors from across the country — including individuals from New York with diverse political affiliations — united to lobby Congress in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 2025. These volunteers, many personally affected by breast or lung cancer, bypassed partisan debates and focused on a shared cause: advancing cancer research funding, supporting health insurance subsidies, and expanding cancer screening access. The event, organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, demonstrated broad bipartisan public support for these health priorities, as confirmed by polls from KFF Health News. Even as political tensions surged — including a federal government shutdown — the volunteers emphasized that cancer ‘doesn’t care’ about political differences. The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, where over 10,000 tea lights honored lives lost to cancer. Personal stories, emotional resonance, and shared experience became powerful tools for bridging political divides and demonstrating that public health advocacy can transcend ideology.",
