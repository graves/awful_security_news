  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early peanut introduction in infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research shows that real-world implementation of medical guidelines has led to significant declines in allergy rates. After 2015, when recommendations were first issued, peanut allergy rates in children under 3 dropped by over 27%, and by over 40% after the 2017 expansion. Dr. David Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records and found that approximately 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015. The landmark LEAP trial, led by Gideon Lack at King’s College London, showed early exposure reduces allergy risk by over 80%. Despite initial hesitancy among doctors and parents, adoption of early allergen introduction has increased, and the practice is now making measurable public health impacts. Experts and advocacy groups like FARE support introducing small amounts of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurt, and tree nut butters between 4 and 6 months of age, without prior screening or testing, as a safe and effective strategy.",
