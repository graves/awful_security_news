  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum, by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses caring for the queen and young—distance themselves from foragers, demonstrating proactive social distancing. When threatened, the ants build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with spaced entrances and longer travel routes, which reduces disease transmission. This combined social and structural response, observed in a study published in Science, represents the first known instance of a non-human social species modifying its physical environment to combat disease. The research has significant implications for human design, suggesting that public spaces could adopt 'architectural immunity' strategies—inspired by ants—to reduce disease spread, especially during epidemics.",
