  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines, flying from Dubai to Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), skidded off the runway and broke in two during landing around 3:50 a.m. local time, resulting in a collision with an airport security patrol car that killed two occupants. The aircraft was partially submerged, with significant structural damage to its tail and front sections. The four crew members survived and were treated at local hospitals. No distress signals were reported, and Emirates confirmed the flight was under its number but operated via a wet-lease from ACT Airlines. The airport suspended operations on the north runway for safety, though other runways remain active, ensuring minimal disruption to daily flights. This incident, though rare given Hong Kong’s high aviation traffic, draws historical context from past accidents at the airport, including a 1999 crash involving a China Airlines flight.",
