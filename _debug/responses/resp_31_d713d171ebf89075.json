  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008 and sentenced to between five and life in prison after a long investigation that revealed he had faked his death and fled the U.S. He was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit, and a false online obituary claiming his death in 2020 raised suspicions. Authorities in Rhode Island and Utah, along with Interpol, helped track him down after he was arrested in Scotland in 2024 due to recognition of his tattoos. Rossi, who used aliases like Arthur Knight and a Brown University tattoo, has a history of evading justice and previous sex-related charges. Prosecutors argued he is a flight risk and serial abuser, while the victim described the trauma of the attacks. The case reflects broader issues in sexual assault accountability, DNA backlog investigations, and international fugitive recovery.",
