  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance visited Israel to reinforce US support for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, downplaying concerns over its fragility despite internal administration worries. While Vance expressed optimism and emphasized the need for time to implement security and humanitarian structures, he declined to set deadlines for Hamas’ disarmament or the return of hostages. The visit comes amid heightened tensions after Hamas allegedly attacked Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed dozens in Gaza. Both sides accused each other of violations but reaffirmed the ceasefire. US officials, including Trump administration figures, are concerned about the deal’s durability, especially in the short term. Trump himself questioned Hamas' involvement in the attack, called it a 'rebellion,' and threatened to 'eradicate' the group if necessary, while also suggesting allies could enter Gaza to take action. The next 30 days are seen as critical for the ceasefire’s survival and for advancing to the next phase of negotiations under the US 20-point peace plan.",
