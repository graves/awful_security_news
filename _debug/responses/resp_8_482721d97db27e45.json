  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, currently located about 300 miles south of Haiti, is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by the end of the week and threaten parts of the Caribbean, particularly Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic, with heavy rainfall and dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. The storm's track remains uncertain, with two possible paths: one turning northwest toward Haiti and Jamaica, and another moving west toward Central America. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the storm could bring dangerous surf and rain to the East Coast, particularly Florida. Recent trends in storm intensification—such as with hurricanes Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto—highlight a growing concern due to climate change and warming oceans. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. The situation remains dynamic, with forecasters continuously monitoring Melissa’s path, strength, and impact potential.",
