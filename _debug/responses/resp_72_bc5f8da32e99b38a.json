  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a strategically timed phone call, Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged in a nearly two-and-a-half-hour dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump to prevent the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. Putin argued that such weapons, while ineffective on the battlefield, would damage the vital U.S.-Russia relationship, which Trump values. The call, described as 'positive and productive,' included praise for Trump’s success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza and a commitment to a future face-to-face summit in Budapest, Hungary, where peace talks could resume. However, Russia has maintained its position that it will not concede on its maximalist goals in Ukraine, including territorial control and postwar constraints. Ukrainian officials suggest that the discussion of Tomahawk missiles prompted Putin’s re-engagement, illustrating a broader Kremlin strategy of using personal diplomacy and short-term gains to influence Trump’s stance on military escalation. This call raises significant questions about the stability of diplomatic efforts and whether Trump’s success in the Middle East will translate into a resolution of the Ukraine conflict.",
