  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig in 2023 by poisoning her protein shakes and eyedrops with cyanide, arsenic, and tetrahydrozoline. Over several weeks, Craig systematically acquired toxic substances — including arsenic via Amazon, potassium cyanide through Midland Scientific, and tetrahydrozoline from a King Soopers store — and used them in a planned, gradual poisoning. He created a fake email account to search for methods of murder and disguised his intentions by falsely claiming medical use for cyanide. Angela’s symptoms began subtly with dizziness and nausea, leading to multiple hospital visits, and by March 18, she was pronounced brain dead. The case underscores the dangers of unregulated access to toxic substances, the importance of medical vigilance, and the role of witnesses in exposing criminal behavior.",
