  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of drone attacks, attributed to Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF), targeted areas in Khartoum, including the international airport, just one day before its long-awaited reopening after over two years of closure. The attacks—reported to include suicide drones and multiple explosions—threaten ongoing reconstruction and civilian recovery efforts. The RSF has repeatedly been accused of targeting military and civilian infrastructure, despite the Sudanese army’s recapture of Khartoum in early 2024. Although over 800,000 people have returned to the capital, violence persists, with continued drone activity and the threat of further escalation in Darfur, especially around el-Fasher. The conflict has caused massive displacement, loss of life, and deep humanitarian crises, with the international community, including the United Nations, warning of potential ethnic violence. This development underscores the fragility of peace and the ongoing risk to Sudan’s stability and recovery.",
