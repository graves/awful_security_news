  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) exhibit both social and architectural behaviors to combat the lethal fungal pathogen Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses—distance themselves from foragers, demonstrating proactive social distancing. Researchers, including Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie, found that infected colonies build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with wider entrances and longer travel routes, which reduce disease transmission. These structural changes complement social behaviors and represent the first documented case of a non-human species actively modifying its environment in response to disease threats. The study, published in Science, highlights the concept of 'architectural immunity' and suggests that principles observed in ant colonies could inspire better public space design to prevent disease spread in human societies.",
