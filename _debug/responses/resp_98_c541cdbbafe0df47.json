  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. conducted a seventh military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean believed to be linked to a Colombian terrorist organization and carrying substantial narcotics. The operation resulted in the deaths of all three men on board and no U.S. casualties. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth framed such cartels as the 'Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere,' justifying lethal strikes without legal review under a newly authorized classified legal opinion. This marks a shift from traditional Coast Guard interdiction to military actions that may constitute summary executions. The actions have drawn criticism from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the U.S. of killing an innocent citizen and responded by canceling U.S. aid. The Senate has resisted efforts to limit presidential war powers, with bipartisan support from Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski. Broader policy shifts include U.S. military authorization in Venezuela targeting President Nicolás Maduro, reflecting a hardline stance against South American drug trafficking and political regimes.",
