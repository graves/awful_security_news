  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement to transfer asylum seekers, a move widely criticized by human rights advocates and Belizean officials. The Trump administration has used such agreements to reduce asylum applications and increase deportations, but critics argue these deals violate international law and may expose asylum seekers to persecution or abuse in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan, or El Salvador, where due process and human rights protections are inadequate. Belize claims it has safeguards such as nationality restrictions, transfer caps, and security screenings, and asserts it does not act as a 'dumping ground'—though opposition leaders like Tracy Taegar Panton argue the country lacks the infrastructure and resources to meet the demands. The agreement requires Senate approval and remains controversial, especially given that some deportees have been returned to their home countries, and others have faced legal and humanitarian violations. This reflects broader concerns that such agreements erode adherence to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and prioritize political and administrative convenience over the protection of vulnerable individuals.",
