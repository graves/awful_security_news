  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago to address protests against ICE agents, drawing on a recent 9th Circuit ruling that upheld the president’s authority to deploy such forces in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that the protests constitute a 'violent resistance' and that judicial review of such decisions must be 'extremely deferential,' citing the 1827 precedent in Martin v. Mott. However, Illinois officials and judges, including Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit, have challenged the administration’s characterization of protests as riots, asserting that local law enforcement has adequately managed the situation and that the circumstances are fundamentally different from wartime exigencies. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision within days, with potential implications for future National Guard deployments across the country.",
