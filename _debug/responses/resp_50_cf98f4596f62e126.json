  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is intensifying legal scrutiny of federal response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation that led to over 1,000 arrests. The judge expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for all agents during protests, citing concerns over the use of tear gas and pepper balls without warningâ€”such as when pastor Rev. David Black was struck multiple times. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras, ICE Special Response Teams are not, and their equipment and training protocols remain underdeveloped. Federal officials testified that agents are trained in crowd control and press handling, but the judge remains skeptical due to inconsistencies and lack of transparency. Leadership changes, including the departure of key officials like Russell Hott, have raised concerns about accountability. The judge plans to depose Hott and Gregory Bovino to obtain firsthand accounts, indicating a broader effort to ensure compliance with constitutional and procedural standards in federal enforcement operations.",
