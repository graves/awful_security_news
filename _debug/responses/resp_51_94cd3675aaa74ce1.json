  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, in response to protests over immigration policies. However, due to a still-active second temporary restraining order, troops cannot be immediately deployed. The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, was criticized by a third judge, Susan P. Graber, who warned it undermines state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. The ruling has sparked fierce opposition from Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who argue the situation is not as violent as portrayed and call for an en banc review. Similar deployments are underway or proposed in Chicago, Memphis, and San Francisco, each facing legal challenges and public resistance. Critics, including senators and local officials, argue that such actions violate constitutional principles, threaten civil liberties, and strain military readiness. The case represents a broader national confrontation over the balance of power between the federal executive and state governments in times of civil unrest, with implications for presidential authority, state sovereignty, and the role of the military in domestic affairs.",
