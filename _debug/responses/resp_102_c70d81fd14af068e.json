President Donald Trump announced the project in July, asserting it would not interfere with the main White House structure and would be privately funded by donors and himself, with no cost to taxpayers. The new ballroom, designed to seat 999 people, is intended to address the perceived limitations of the existing East Room. Construction began in September with site prep and demolition, with the East Wing offices being temporarily relocated. Carrier Global Corp has donated HVAC systems for the ballroom, and the project is projected to be completed by January 2029. The White House has not disclosed full donor information, and the lack of regulatory approval raises concerns about compliance with federal oversight standards.",
