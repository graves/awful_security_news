  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals a system of labor exploitation in Guatemala’s maquila garment factories, where women workers face long hours, low pay, sexual harassment, and threats to their safety. Despite their crucial role in supplying clothing to US brands like Target, Ralph Lauren, and Carhartt, workers are largely unprotected. Korean-owned factories dominate the sector, and US brands benefit from subcontracting without legal accountability. Workers report daily quotas, dirty water, and abuse, with union activity met with violence or dismissal. Government oversight is weak, with inspectors blocked from entering factories and workers denied severance or pensions. The article underscores systemic gendered exploitation and raises concerns over global supply chain integrity, especially as US trade policies shift. Though Guatemala’s new president, Bernardo Arévalo, has introduced reforms, enforcement remains weak, and workers remain vulnerable and powerless.",
