  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. conducted its seventh military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean allegedly linked to a Colombian terrorist organization and carrying substantial narcotics. The operation resulted in the deaths of all three individuals on board, with no U.S. casualties. The Trump administration has framed drug cartels as equivalent to Al Qaeda, authorizing lethal strikes without due process or legal review, supported by a classified legal opinion. This move has drawn significant criticism from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the U.S. of killing an innocent citizen and responded by denouncing Trump’s actions. The Senate, including bipartisan lawmakers like Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, has opposed such actions, arguing they represent a dangerous expansion of presidential war powers. The broader strategy includes covert CIA operations in Venezuela and the threat of military intervention to pressure leaders like Nicolás Maduro, reflecting a hardline stance on drug trafficking and regional governance.",
