  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China have reignited after a brief truce, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening 130% tariffs on Chinese exports and export controls on critical software, effective November 1, 2025. China responded by restricting exports of rare-earth minerals—essential for electronics and defense—on grounds of national security and technological sovereignty. These actions follow a series of mutual retaliatory measures, including U.S. restrictions on Huawei and export controls on advanced chips. While U.S. officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer claim recent de-escalation, a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea offers a diplomatic opportunity to resolve the crisis. However, the situation remains volatile, with both nations poised to impose significant economic penalties if negotiations fail.",
