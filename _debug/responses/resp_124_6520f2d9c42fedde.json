  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of U.S. military operations in the Caribbean, President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel have been repatriated to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia. The vessel, reportedly carrying fentanyl and other narcotics, was targeted on a well-known trafficking route to the U.S., with the U.S. claiming at least 29 deaths, including one additional fatality. The operation is being justified by Trump as part of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, invoking legal precedents from the George W. Bush era. Colombian President Gustavo Petro confirmed that a detained Colombian national is alive and will be prosecuted. Legal experts have raised serious concerns about the constitutionality and international law implications of treating drug traffickers as enemy combatants. Meanwhile, Congress has expressed unease over the lack of transparency and congressional authorization for these strikes, with bipartisan calls for oversight. The actions also extend to broader geopolitical efforts, such as alleged covert operations against Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro.",
