  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have begun with the announcement of the medicine award to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full announcement cycle spans from October 6 to October 13, covering medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics. Previous laureates such as Victor Ambros, John Hopfield, Geoffrey Hinton, David Baker, Demis Hassabis, John Jumper, Han Kang, Nihon Hidankyo, and Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson are cited to show the historical impact and scope of the prizes. The article also highlights political controversies, particularly around Donald Trumpâ€™s claims to the peace prize, which experts say lack alignment with the prizeâ€™s focus on durable peace and institutional work. The Nobel committees emphasize academic freedom and scientific integrity, with concerns raised about political interference from the Trump administration. The prizes are awarded annually on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobelâ€™s death, with ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo and global media coverage.",
