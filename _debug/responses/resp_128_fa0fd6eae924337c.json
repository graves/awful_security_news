  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a woman named Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison in 2025 after being extradited from France. The case, delayed for over a decade due to prosecutorial inaction and destroyed evidence, gained momentum when Keeler publicly shared her story in 2021. Cleary, who had lived in Silicon Valley and worked at Tesla, sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you' in 2019, which reignited efforts to pursue justice. Despite a guilty plea and expressed remorse, the victim, Keeler, emphasized the system’s failure to protect her, noting that evidence was destroyed and charges were dropped for years. The case underscores the challenges in prosecuting campus sexual assault cases, the role of public advocacy in achieving justice, and the importance of mental health treatment and accountability in such crimes.",
