  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The murder trial of Sean Grayson, a Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy, is set to begin in Peoria, Illinois, following his 2024 shooting of Sonya Massey, a Black woman who had a history of mental health struggles. Grayson, who responded to a call about a suspected prowler, entered her home, reacted to a pan of hot water, and interpreted her religious statement as a threat, leading to a confrontation in which he fired three times, fatally wounding Massey. Despite her prior mental health treatment and multiple 911 calls expressing fear, Grayson was unaware of her condition. His history of misconduct—including DUI convictions and poor performance evaluations—raised concerns about hiring practices. The incident prompted the resignation of Sheriff Jack Campbell and led to a state law change requiring full disclosure of personal and employment backgrounds for all law enforcement applicants. The case has become a flashpoint for national debate over police violence, implicit bias, mental health, and transparency in law enforcement hiring.",
