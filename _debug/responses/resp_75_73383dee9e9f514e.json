  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article investigates the exploitative working conditions in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, where tens of thousands of mostly female workers produce clothing for major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Despite being crucial to Guatemala’s economy—accounting for nearly 10% of GDP—the factories operate under severe labor abuses: long hours, daily quotas, wage theft, dirty water, and sexual harassment. Korean companies dominate ownership, with nearly two-thirds of textile investments, and US brands benefit from sub-contracting without direct responsibility for worker rights. Workers face threats, violence, and retaliation for union activity, with labor inspectors blocked from factory access. A culture of fear is rampant, as seen in the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal and threats of violence against union members. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra endure financial devastation when factories close, with no pension or severance. While President Bernardo Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage and pledged reform, enforcement remains weak. The article reveals a global supply chain system that prioritizes cost over human rights, and warns of future instability due to US import tariffs and the vulnerability of women-dominated labor in the global apparel industry.",
