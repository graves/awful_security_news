  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The construction of a new $250 million White House ballroom, set to hold 999 people, has ignited ethical concerns over who is funding it and whether it constitutes a 'pay-to-play' scheme. While President Donald Trump claims personal and donor contributions, only YouTube has officially pledged $22 million through a legal settlement with Trump over the January 6 Capitol riot. A donor dinner on October 15, 2025, brought together executives from major corporations including Blackstone, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Palantir, as well as sports franchises like the Jets and Buccaneers. Critics, including former ethics lawyer Richard Painter, argue that the funding model could allow corporations to gain access to the administration in exchange for donations. The Trust for the National Mall manages the donations, but no official list of contributors has been released. The White House maintains that the project does not cost taxpayers and will be used by future administrations, but legal experts warn it may push ethical boundaries by enabling corporate influence over policy.",
