  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France from 2007 to 2012, has become the first French ex-president to go to jail, serving a five-year sentence for criminal association in a secret campaign financing scheme involving Libyan funds from Muammar Gaddafi. Though he denies personal wrongdoing, he was convicted for his aides' role in arranging meetings with Gaddafi’s intelligence officials through intermediary Ziad Tiakeddine. Sarkozy is currently held in solitary confinement at La Santé prison, where he is isolated from other inmates and has limited contact with the outside world. He has appealed the conviction and is expected to receive a verdict from France’s highest administrative court in late October 2025. Despite the legal outcome, political figures like President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin have shown public support, highlighting the broader societal and political implications of the case.",
