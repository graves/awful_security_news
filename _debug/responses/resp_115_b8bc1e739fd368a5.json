  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has introduced sweeping new policies to de-register international humanitarian organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological grounds such as alleged support for terrorist activities or incitement of racism. The Israeli military’s COGAT committee, which includes representatives from the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, approves or denies re-registration based on broad and opaque criteria. Major aid groups like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps have been denied access or are in the appeals process, effectively halting their operations. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that promised increased aid, only two of Gaza’s seven border crossings are open, and aid shipments remain severely restricted. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the primary humanitarian provider in Gaza for decades, has been banned from sending staff or supplies since March 2025, with its emergency food reserves in Jordan and Egypt still unsent. Humanitarian officials argue that the policy is politically motivated and undermines global humanitarian access, while Israel claims these measures are for security, without providing evidence.",
