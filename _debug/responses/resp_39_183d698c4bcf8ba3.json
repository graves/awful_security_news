  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man, to five years to life in prison for raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. Rossi, who had previously been wanted in Rhode Island for failing to register as a sex offender, was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit and was later arrested in Scotland in 2021 after an Interpol notice recognized his distinctive tattoos. An online obituary claiming he died in 2020 was later disputed, leading to suspicion of a fake death and flight from justice. Rossi used aliases like Arthur Knight to evade capture and was found to have a history of financial exploitation and manipulation. He was convicted in both August and September 2025, with the second sentencing scheduled for November. The victim described the trauma and fear caused by the abuse, emphasizing the need for accountability and safety. Despite maintaining his innocence, Rossi was found guilty by jury. His case underscores the dangers of flight from justice, the importance of DNA backlog investigations, and the role of international cooperation in solving crimes.",
