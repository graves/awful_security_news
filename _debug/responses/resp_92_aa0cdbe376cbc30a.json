  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to have survived its first major test following the killing of two Israeli soldiers in Gaza, which prompted Israeli airstrikes and accusations of violations from both sides. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched strikes killing at least 44 people, while Hamas affirmed its commitment to the ceasefire and accused Israel of violating it by targeting civilians and approaching the Yellow Line. Both sides blame each other for breaches, including Hamas firing beyond the Yellow Line and Israel killing Palestinians near it. Aid deliveries were briefly halted but resumed, signaling continued adherence to certain ceasefire elements, though the Rafah crossing remains closed. The Al-Qassam Brigades (AQB) stated they found and will hand over an Israeli hostage, and a ‘security campaign’ by Hamas against collaborators has led to violent internal clashes, including a public execution. US officials, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are actively present to push the agreement forward, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meeting them. Political pressure mounts from far-right figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, who criticize the resumption of aid as a backdown. The situation remains volatile, with the future of the ceasefire and the return of hostages still unresolved.",
