  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Orange juice prices in the UK have surged by 134% since 2020, driven by a global supply crisis caused by citrus greening, droughts, extreme weather, trade wars, and tariffs. The core issue lies in Brazil's severely damaged orange crop due to disease and climate, while Florida's production has declined due to hurricanes. This has led to a sharp rise in concentrate prices, with global orange juice concentrate reaching $7 per kilo. In response, manufacturers are substituting oranges with cheaper alternatives like mandarins and mango. Trade tensions, especially US tariffs on Brazilian exports, and new packaging regulations (Extended Producer Responsibility) further inflate costs. Although the UK eliminated some tariffs in 2024, these measures have been overshadowed by underlying cost increases. The situation reflects a broader trend of food inflation, with beef, butter, coffee, and chocolate also rising. Experts suggest that supply chain concentration, lack of price transparency, and climate vulnerability mean that rising food prices may persist, and the UK remains highly dependent on imported fruit, making it susceptible to global disruptions.",
