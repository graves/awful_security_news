  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. The attack, which wounded Fico severely, was ruled a terrorism offense by the Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica, citing Cintula’s intent to oppose Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. While Cintula claimed he did not want to kill and described the attack as a protest against societal fear, the court found it politically motivated and thus terrorism. The verdict reflects deep political and cultural divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming opposition forces for creating social unrest and opposition parties accusing him of undermining democracy, media freedom, and democratic standards. Fico has since forgiven Cintula, and the case remains a symbol of the risks of political polarization in democratic societies.",
