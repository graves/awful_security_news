  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 19, 2025, millions of people across the United States participated in large-scale 'No Kings' protests against President Donald Trump, expressing opposition to his expanded executive power, immigration crackdowns, and healthcare cuts. The protests, held in major cities including New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles, were largely peaceful, with no arrests reported. Protesters used signs like 'Democracy not Monarchy' to emphasize their commitment to constitutional governance, rejecting claims that the demonstrations were tied to Antifa. In response, several states activated the National Guard, although no violence occurred. Prominent political figures such as Senator Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy praised the demonstrations as a historic defense of democracy. The movement also gained international traction, with protests in Europe showing solidarity with American demonstrators. Public opinion polls indicate significant disapproval of Trump’s performance, reflecting widespread concern over democratic erosion.",
