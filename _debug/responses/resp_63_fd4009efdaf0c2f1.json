The push originated from claims made by former President Donald Trump, who advised pregnant women to avoid Tylenol despite scientific evidence supporting its safety. The FDA has not found clear evidence of harm from appropriate acetaminophen use during pregnancy, and multiple studies—including one involving over 2 million children—have found no significant association between the drug and neurodevelopmental disorders. Kenvue and medical experts argue that the proposed changes are unsupported by science, arbitrary, and contrary to established medical guidelines. In contrast, the Informed Consent Action Network has petitioned the FDA to add stronger warnings, citing perceived public health risks. Regulatory bodies in the EU, UK, and Canada have affirmed the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy, highlighting international consensus. The article underscores the tension between political messaging and scientific evidence in public health policy.",
