  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court is set to consider a pivotal firearms case involving Ali Danial Hemani, a Texas man charged with a gun offense after being identified as a regular marijuana user. The Trump administration has asked the Court to reinstate the case, arguing that such individuals pose a serious public safety risk. However, Hemani’s legal team contends the blanket ban on drug users from owning guns violates the Second Amendment, particularly under the Supreme Court’s 2022 expanded interpretation of gun rights. A federal appellate court previously struck down the law as unconstitutional, citing a lack of historical grounding. The case highlights a growing legal and political debate over how drug use and gun ownership intersect under federal law, especially as marijuana is legal in many states. Arguments are expected in early 2026, with a decision likely by early summer 2026, and could set a precedent for gun rights in relation to drug use nationwide.",
