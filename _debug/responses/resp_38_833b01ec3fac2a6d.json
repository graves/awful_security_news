  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced it would redirect Section 32 tariff revenue — typically used for child nutrition — to fund the WIC program during the government shutdown, avoiding a complete halt for nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This decision follows the lapse in federal funding for fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1, 2025, and resulted in the USDA withholding regular WIC allocations. The National WIC Association and budget experts have expressed concern over the legality and clarity of the funding plan, noting that Congress has not formally authorized the use of tariff funds for WIC. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized Democrats for causing the shutdown, blaming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for political decisions that disrupted vital programs. While the USDA has provided up to $150 million in contingency funds and allows states to use manufacturer rebates, advocates stress the need for long-term, stable funding to protect vulnerable families amid rising food costs and inflation. The White House’s move reflects a broader political and fiscal effort to sustain critical social programs during a government shutdown.",
