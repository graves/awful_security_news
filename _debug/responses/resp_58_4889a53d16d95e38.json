  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 1919 gouache painting titled 'Still Life with Guitar' by Pablo Picasso has gone missing after being delivered to the CajaGranada Cultural Center in Granada, Spain, where it was scheduled to be displayed in a temporary exhibition starting October 9, 2025. The artwork, insured for 600,000 euros ($700,000), was transported under video surveillance from Madrid to Granada and moved through a series of monitored steps, including a freight elevator transfer. Despite all video footage showing no incidents, the painting was discovered missing during the unpacking process on Monday, October 13, 2025. Spanish police have launched an investigation to determine when and where the painting disappeared, and it has been added to the international database of stolen artworks. The case is notable given the history of Picasso’s paintings being targeted by thieves—such as the recovery of 'Portrait of Dora Maar' in 2019 and 'Head of a Woman' in 2021—demonstrating a persistent threat to high-value art works.",
