The exchange has been facilitated by the Qassam Brigades and monitored by the ICRC, but significant concerns remain over the conditions of the bodies, including signs of physical abuse. Hamas has criticized Israel for failing to open the Rafah border crossing with Egypt since May 2024, which violates the ceasefire terms and severely restricts humanitarian access to Gaza. The closure has been legally challenged by the International Court of Justice, but remains unenforced. Palestinian activists like Ubai Al-Aboudi argue that Israeli detention practices amount to hostage-taking, dehumanizing the Palestinian population. The situation reflects a fragile peace, marked by slow implementation, ongoing violations, and deep humanitarian and ethical concerns.",
