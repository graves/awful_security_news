  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that President Donald Trump likely exercised lawful authority to federalize 200 Oregon National Guard members for deployment to Portland, despite no serious emergency and strong objections from state officials and civil liberties groups. The decision comes after a prior ruling by District Judge Karin Immergut blocked the deployment, with a second temporary order still in effect. Critics, including Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and the ACLU, argue that the ruling grants the President unilateral power to deploy troops in peaceful cities, undermines state sovereignty, and threatens constitutional rights such as free assembly and due process. The administration has justified the deployment by claiming Portland is 'war-ravaged' due to protests, though such claims are disputed and seen by critics as politically motivated and absurd. The case raises broader concerns about the balance of executive power, civil liberties, and the appropriate use of military force in domestic settings.",
