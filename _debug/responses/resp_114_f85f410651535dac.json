  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented a sweeping policy to restrict international humanitarian access in Gaza and the West Bank by banning the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) from operating and requiring major international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to re-register under new ideological criteria. These new rules, enforced by COGAT, include vetting for alleged support of 'terrorist groups' or 'incitement to racism,' with many organizations, including the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps, being denied re-registration or placed in limbo. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, and many aid trucks are rejected without explanation. Humanitarian officials argue that the process is ideologically driven and designed to eliminate organizations that are critical of Israel or have different political perspectives. The situation has exacerbated a severe humanitarian crisis, with UNRWA’s stockpiles of food and medical supplies in Egypt and Jordan unable to reach Gaza due to Israeli restrictions. The U.S. funding cut to UNRWA in 2024 further undermines its operations, and the international community is struggling to respond effectively.",
