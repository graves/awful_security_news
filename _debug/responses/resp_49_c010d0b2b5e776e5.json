  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary investigation by Portugal’s GPIAAF found that a steel cable in the Glória funicular in Lisbon failed to meet certification and operator specifications, leading to a deadly crash on September 1, 2025. The cable snapped shortly after the cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, causing one car to derail and crash into a building, killing at least 16 people and injuring several others. Eyewitnesses, including Bruno, described the scene as chaotic and uncontrollable. The report also highlighted serious failures in maintenance, with tasks falsely marked as completed and the maintenance plan falsely declared compliant. While the findings are preliminary, they point to systemic issues in safety standards and oversight within the CARRIS-operated funicular system.",
