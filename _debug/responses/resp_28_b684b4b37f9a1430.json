  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 heist at the Louvre Museum, in which thieves used industrial tools to steal Napoleonic crown jewels during daylight hours, marks a disturbing shift in museum crime. Unlike traditional art thefts driven by cultural value, this incident reflects a new trend where thieves target artifacts for their raw materials—such as gold, diamonds, and metals—that can be melted down or sold for profit. The heist is compared to previous attacks, including the 2019 Green Vault robbery and the 1990 Gardner Museum heist, indicating a pattern of increasing sophistication and aggression. Evidence such as discarded tools and a damaged crown of Empress Eugénie suggests a highly organized operation, possibly linked to organized crime like the Remmo clan. French authorities suspect a pattern of related crimes in Paris and Limoges, and Interpol has added the stolen jewels to its database. Experts warn that museums, due to their open access and lack of physical barriers, are becoming increasingly vulnerable, raising concerns about a broader escalation in cultural terrorism and the irreversible loss of national heritage.",
