  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI voice scam targeting Italian businessmen exploited the realistic capabilities of AI-generated voice clones, using a deepfake version of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request millions in funds. The scam, which occurred in early 2025, highlighted the growing ability of AI to mimic human voices so closely that even trained listeners cannot reliably distinguish them. Research by Queen Mary University of London found that 58% of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices, and participants often rated AI voices as more trustworthy. The fraud coincided with a period of heightened attention on Italian citizens abroad, such as journalist Cecilia Sala’s release. Beyond financial fraud, AI-generated deepfakes are being used to create fake news and sexual content, including child sexual abuse material, prompting global policy responses. The U.S. and Australia have introduced laws to ban the creation and distribution of AI-generated intimate images, demonstrating the serious societal and legal implications of advancing AI voice technology.",
