  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian solidarity activist and legal permanent resident, was detained in March 2025 after participating in activism at Columbia University. He was released in June 2025 by a federal district court based on a habeas corpus petition, which challenged the legality of his detention. The U.S. government is attempting to deport him, arguing that his presence has 'adverse foreign policy consequences,' citing an immigration law provision used to target activists. Civil rights groups, including the ACLU, argue this is an unconstitutional attack on free speech. Khalil’s case is now under appeal in the Board of Immigration Appeals, with the possibility of further constitutional challenges. A separate federal judge found that the Trump administration's crackdown on similar activists violated free speech protections, underscoring the broader implications of the case for political expression and immigration enforcement in the United States.",
