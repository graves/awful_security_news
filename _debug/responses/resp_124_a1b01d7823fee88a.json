  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator and political outsider, has won Bolivia’s presidential election with 54.5% of the vote, defeating former president Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga. This marks the end of 20 years of MAS rule and signals a major political and economic shift. Paz, running with ex-police officer Edman Lara, appeals to rural and working-class voters frustrated by inflation, fuel shortages, and economic mismanagement. His plan to dismantle Bolivia’s fixed exchange rate, end fuel subsidies, and reduce public spending represents a sharp departure from the MAS economic model. Despite promising gradual reforms to avoid recession, critics question the fiscal feasibility of his approach. The U.S. State Department congratulated Paz and expressed interest in restoring economic stability and bilateral relations, marking a reversal from past tensions. The election reflects deep class and regional divides, with Paz winning in rural and Indigenous areas and Quiroga in wealthier eastern zones. Paz’s victory sets Bolivia on a path of economic uncertainty and potential transformation, with his inauguration scheduled for November 8.",
