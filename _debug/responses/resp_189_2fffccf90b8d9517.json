  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports that King Charles III is urging the public to focus on duty and service, especially in light of ongoing allegations against his brother Prince Andrew, who has voluntarily given up his royal titles, including Duke of York and membership in the Order of the Garter. The scrutiny stems from claims in Virginia Giuffre's posthumously published memoir that Prince Andrew was involved in trafficking and forced sexual encounters with her, tied to Jeffrey Epstein. New U.S. documents suggest Prince Andrew sought personal information about Giuffre in 2011, which contradicts his public denials. The Metropolitan Police is investigating these claims. The royal family has expressed deep concern for Epstein's victims and aims to redirect public focus toward community support, such as after the Manchester synagogue attack and during a state visit to the Vatican. Political figures like Rachael Maskell and Flynn are calling for legal reform to allow the monarch to formally remove royal titles, while government officials, including Bridget Phillipson, have declined to intervene. The issue highlights tensions between royal tradition, public accountability, and the need to address historical wrongs.",
