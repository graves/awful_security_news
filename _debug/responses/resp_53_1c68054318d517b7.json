  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the drug’s safety label that would warn about a possible link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that such use increases neurodevelopmental risks, scientific studies — including one of over 2 million children — have found no causal link. The FDA has not found clear evidence supporting a connection, and multiple international health agencies, including the EU, UK, and Canada, affirm the safety of acetaminophen in pregnancy. Kenvue argues that label changes are unsupported by evidence and would contradict established medical science and FDA policy, emphasizing that appropriate use of Tylenol remains safe and recommended during pregnancy.",
