  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has received two bodies from Hamas, which claims they are two deceased Israeli hostages, bringing the total confirmed dead to 15 out of 28 under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal. The bodies were transferred via the Red Cross and escorted by the IDF to Tel Aviv for identification. The transfer is part of a broader agreement that includes the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees, and the return of 15 Palestinian bodies per Israeli hostage body. Despite progress, there is public outrage in Israel over Hamasâ€™s slow and incomplete return of the deceased, with Hamas citing difficulties in locating bodies amid destroyed buildings. The ceasefire, which also included a partial Israeli withdrawal and increased aid to Gaza, has seen flare-ups of violence, indicating a fragile peace. The conflict began with a Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, leading to over 68,000 deaths in Gaza since then according to Hamas-run health data.",
