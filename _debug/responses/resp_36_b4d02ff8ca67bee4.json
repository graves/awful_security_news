  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves used a truck-mounted ladder and industrial tools to steal nine Napoleonic jewels in just four minutes, marks a troubling shift in museum crime. Unlike traditional art theft, the focus is now on raw materials—jewels, coins, and medals—because they can be melted down or sold for high liquidity. This trend, previously seen in the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden, suggests a new form of 'cultural terrorism' executed with military precision. Evidence such as grinders, a blowtorch, and a damaged crown of Empress Eugénie was found, indicating a highly organized operation. French authorities suspect a link between this heist and earlier thefts at Paris’ Natural History Museum and a Limoges museum, possibly involving organized crime like the Remmo Clan. Experts warn that museums, open to the public and often with weak physical barriers, are becoming increasingly vulnerable. The incident has sparked national outrage and a major investigation, with Interpol now tracking the stolen artifacts. The heist raises serious concerns about the long-term preservation of cultural heritage and the security of one of the world’s most iconic institutions.",
