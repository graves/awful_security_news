  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America have intensified in 2024–2025, with a notable instance in Madagascar where Gen Z protesters, supported by military intervention, forced the removal of President Andry Rajoelina. This echoes similar movements in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, where youth activism over issues like corruption, economic opportunity, and governance failures led to regime changes. While in Bangladesh, a peaceful transition occurred with a Nobel Peace Prize winner succeeding the ousted leader, in Madagascar, the military now controls the government, raising concerns about democratic legitimacy. The article warns African leaders—especially those in long-standing or military rule—that growing youth assertiveness and access to technology are making such movements more likely. Leaders like William Ruto in Kenya and Yoweri Museveni in Uganda are actively resisting, using threats or repression to maintain power. Experts like Kingsley Moghalu and Swikani Ncube emphasize that youth frustration over unemployment, poor services, and governance failure is deep-rooted and may lead to a recurring pattern of political upheaval across Africa.",
