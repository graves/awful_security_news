  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has received two bodies from Hamas, which claims they are two more deceased Israeli hostages, potentially bringing the total number of confirmed dead to 15 under the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The bodies were transferred via the Red Cross from Gaza to Israel, where they will be formally identified in Tel Aviv. The ceasefire deal includes the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees in exchange for the return of 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli hostage’s remains. Hamas has previously faced criticism for mistakenly transferring a Palestinian body, citing difficulties in locating bodies amid rubble. The Israeli military has urged the public to remain sensitive and await official identification, stressing that Hamas must uphold the agreement to return all deceased hostages. Public outrage in Israel stems from the slow progress in returning the dead, and while the ceasefire has brought a temporary halt to fighting and increased aid to Gaza, deadly violence has flared again, suggesting possible breaches of the agreement. The conflict originated from the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, leading to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, where over 68,000 people have been killed according to Hamas-run health ministry figures.",
