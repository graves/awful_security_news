  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced intense scrutiny over its controversial military strikes in the Caribbean, where it claimed to be targeting 'narco-terrorists' attempting to deliver fentanyl to the U.S. After a failed strike on a drug-carrying submarine, two survivors were released to Colombia and Ecuador instead of being detained or prosecuted. This decision undermines the administration’s claim of a military conflict, as it suggests the individuals were not sufficiently dangerous to justify detention. Legal experts, including Jack Goldsmith, have criticized the administration for claiming war-like powers without congressional declaration or public evidence. Critics such as Colombian President Gustavo Petro and lawmakers like Senator Todd Young have questioned both the legality and transparency of these actions, highlighting concerns about due process, habeas corpus, and the absence of public evidence. The move to release the individuals appears to be an effort to avoid legal accountability and judicial scrutiny, raising broader questions about the legality and legitimacy of the administration’s operations in Latin America.",
