  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals that Guatemala’s garment factories (maquilas), which supply clothing to major US brands like Carhartt, Target, and Ralph Lauren, operate under exploitative conditions with low wages, long hours, and rampant abuse. Despite being a key part of Guatemala’s economy—accounting for nearly 10% of GDP—these factories are largely hidden from public view, with workers facing threats, sexual harassment, and suppression of labor rights. Korean companies dominate investment in the sector, and US brands benefit from opaque supply chains without legal accountability. Workers, mostly women, endure extreme hardship, including unpaid wages, job losses due to factory closures, and threats to union activity, such as the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal. Even when labor inspectors attempt to enforce regulations, they are obstructed. While Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo introduced progressive reforms like a 6% minimum wage increase, enforcement remains weak. The article ends with personal stories of workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra, who lost pensions and livelihoods, and a growing sense of fear and hopelessness, underscoring the deep human cost of global fashion supply chains.",
