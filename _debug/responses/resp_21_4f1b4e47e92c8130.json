Both are now being repatriated to the UK under a bilateral agreement signed between the UK and Indonesia on October 21, 2025. The deal, led by UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Indonesian Senior Minister of Law Yusril Ihza Mahendra, reflects growing international concern over capital punishment for drug offenses, especially in countries with strict drug laws like Indonesia, which has over 530 death row inmates, nearly 100 of them foreign nationals. This case draws attention to the role of diplomacy in preventing the execution of foreign nationals and underscores Indonesia’s status as a major drug smuggling hub despite its harsh sentencing laws.",
