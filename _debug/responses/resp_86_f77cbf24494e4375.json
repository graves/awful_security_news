  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two voter turnout organizations in Georgia, the New Georgia Project and its affiliated Action Fund, founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams in 2013, have announced their closure. The groups were central to mobilizing nonwhite and young voters, contributing to Democratic victories in the 2020 presidential election and the 2021 Senate runoffs. Despite early success, they faced significant legal challenges, including a record $300,000 fine from the Georgia Ethics Commission in 2018 for illegal campaign activities and improper fundraising, and a subsequent decline in funding and staff. Organizers reported knocking on 4 million doors in 2020 and praised the outreach as unmatched in progressive politics. The closure, along with legal losses at Fair Fight, raises urgent questions about the sustainability of Abrams’ voter organizing model in Georgia, especially as Democrats prepare for key elections in 2026, including Sen. Jon Ossoff’s re-election and a gubernatorial race. The decline signals a broader challenge in maintaining Democratic grassroots momentum in a state where Republicans have historically held dominant power.",
