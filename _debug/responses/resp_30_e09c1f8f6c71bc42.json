  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a deadly September 2025 funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, a steel cable on the Glória funicular failed to meet certification and operational specifications set by its operator, CARRIS. The cable snapped shortly after the vehicles began their journey along Calçada da Glória, causing one car to derail and crash into a building, killing at least 16 people and injuring others. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal serious flaws in cable integrity, maintenance practices, and brake systems, including falsified records that marked maintenance as completed even when not performed. The operator’s maintenance plan was falsely recorded as compliant, raising concerns about oversight and accountability. Eyewitnesses described the event as chaotic and deadly, with one man named Bruno recounting the scene. A final, conclusive report is expected to be released next year.",
