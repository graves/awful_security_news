    "Scientists have observed a mysterious, diffuse glow of gamma rays at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008.",
    "The glow has been attributed to two main theories: pulsars (the remnants of exploded stars) and dark matter collisions, particularly involving WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).",
    "Previously, the glow's shape—matching the galactic bulge—was thought to favor pulsar explanations, as dark matter was expected to produce a more spherical pattern.",
    "New computer simulations show that dark matter in the Milky Way may have a squashed, egg-shaped distribution, which closely matches the observed glow shape, lending support to the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "A 50% chance is now estimated that the glow is due to dark matter, according to Joseph Silk, a physicist from Johns Hopkins University.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate in 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively confirm or refute the dark matter link.",
    "If confirmed, this would be a major breakthrough in physics, offering direct observational evidence for dark matter and potentially confirming that WIMPs exist and interact via annihilation.",
    "Despite the lack of direct detection, the Fermi data and new simulations keep WIMPs a viable and compelling explanation in the ongoing quest to solve the dark matter mystery."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists are investigating the origin of a mysterious gamma-ray glow detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. While the glow was initially thought to come from pulsars, new simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues show that dark matter—specifically WIMPs—could produce a squashed, egg-shaped distribution that matches the observed glow. This gives the dark matter theory a significant boost, with a 50% chance being viable. However, the definitive test will come from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate in 2027, which will offer higher-resolution gamma-ray data. The discovery would be a landmark in physics, potentially confirming dark matter’s existence and the nature of WIMPs. Despite decades of effort, dark matter remains unseen, but the Fermi data and new simulations keep the possibility alive and inspire continued global research.",
