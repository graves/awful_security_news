  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a recent Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s Chernihiv region, at least four people were killed and 10 others injured, with widespread power and water outages affecting hundreds of thousands. The attacks targeted key energy facilities, and Russian drones were accused of circling to obstruct repairs. The town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, about 20 miles from the Russian border, was particularly hard-hit, prompting residents to rely on emergency tents and generators. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemned Russia’s tactics as deliberate terror, while the U.S. President Donald Trump expressed interest in sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for counterattacks. However, a proposed summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was canceled, with both sides stressing no immediate plans. European leaders and the EU rejected any territorial concessions to Russia, insisting that peace negotiations must preserve existing borders.",
