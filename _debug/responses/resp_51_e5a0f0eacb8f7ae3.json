  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal that some saw as a major diplomatic win, public opinion in the United States shows little enthusiasm for President Donald Trump’s handling of the issue. While Trump’s approval on Gaza slightly increased in recent polls, disapproval remains high, and his overall approval rating has dropped to a low point in his second term. More significantly, Americans are deeply concerned about the economy, with growing disapproval of Trump’s economic policies, particularly regarding inflation and the cost of living. Polling data indicates a widespread sense of economic pessimism, with declining expectations for wage growth and economic improvement. Public priorities are clearly shifted from foreign policy to domestic economic issues, suggesting that even major international achievements like the Gaza deal are overshadowed by the persistent economic anxieties of ordinary Americans.",
