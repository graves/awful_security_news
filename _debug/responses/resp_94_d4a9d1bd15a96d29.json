  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the first general election debate of the 2025 NYC mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner, faced criticism for lacking specific policy details on rent control, free buses, and police reform. Despite being endorsed by Governor Kathy Hochul, Mamdani declined to endorse her reelection, focusing instead on the mayoral race. He defended his progressive platform, including tax increases on wealthy residents and a proposed Department of Community Safety with social worker deployment in crises. Critics, including Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, questioned his viability, with Cuomo claiming Mamdani's plan relies on a 'myth' of Albany passing new taxes and accusing him of being soft on crime. Sliwa, the Republican nominee, attacked Cuomo’s past decisions and appealed to moderate Democrats. The debate also centered on foreign policy, with Mamdani expressing opposition to racial hierarchies in statehood and supporting a ceasefire in Gaza while rejecting claims of Israeli 'occupation.' Mamdani also apologized for past anti-police rhetoric and emphasized his willingness to collaborate with President Donald Trump on affordability issues, though he remains committed to equitable, community-centered governance.",
