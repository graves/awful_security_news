  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was convicted of aggravated identity theft and wire fraud stemming from fabricated campaign details, was released from prison on October 18, 2025, after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence. Santos, expelled from Congress in 2023, had been serving his 87-month sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey. The commutation came after Santos publicly pleaded for fairness and acknowledged taking full responsibility for his actions. The decision drew praise from Republican allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, while facing criticism from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who argued it diverted attention from pressing national issues such as healthcare. The case underscores broader debates over presidential clemency, congressional integrity, and political accountability.",
