    "President Donald Trump suggested that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be priced at $150 per month, referencing a comparison to drug prices in Europe.",
    "Dr. Mehmet Oz, the president's physician and CMS administrator, clarified that such a price reduction was not yet finalized or negotiated, calling it a 'not a done deal' scenario.",
    "The proposal triggered significant market reactions: stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dropped by about 4% after the announcement, reflecting investor concern over potential price cuts.",
    "Currently, GLP-1 medications cost $1,000 or more per month in the US, with out-of-pocket costs often ranging from $25 to $500, making access difficult for many patients.",
    "Some patients rely on compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs, which are cheaper (e.g., $150) but face safety and regulation concerns due to lack of oversight.",
    "Medical experts and researchers are skeptical about achieving a $150 monthly price, noting it would require significant negotiations and may not be part of existing policy frameworks like the Inflation Reduction Act.",
    "Despite skepticism, doctors and patients say a $150 price point would be a game-changer for access, affordability, and broader use of weight-loss drugs.",
    "The proposal is seen more as political posturing or a negotiating tactic rather than a guaranteed outcome, with experts warning that current barriers to access remain high even at current prices."

The proposal sparked significant reactions: patients reported hope for greater affordability, doctors noted improved access could be transformative, and stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dropped sharply. Experts remain skeptical, citing the complexity of negotiations and lack of precedent, though many agree that a $150 price would dramatically improve access for millions of Americans. While the idea has been framed as political posturing or a negotiating tactic, the potential for broader affordability and patient access remains a major public health issue.",
