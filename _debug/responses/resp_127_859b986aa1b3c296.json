  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The publication of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumously released memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' has reignited a long-standing scandal involving Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, detailed allegations that she was recruited by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at age 17 and sexually abused by Prince Andrew on multiple occasions, including at Epstein’s home and on his private island. The memoir, which went to No. 1 on Amazon’s bestseller list, includes claims that Epstein paid her $15,000 after her first encounter with Andrew and that the prince’s staff attempted to hire internet trolls to discredit her. Despite Prince Andrew’s repeated denials and claims of no memory of the 2001 photo with Giuffre, new evidence such as a 2011 email showing he remained in contact with Epstein and a Metropolitan Police investigation into his request for a criminal record check has intensified scrutiny. Public and political pressure, including a parliamentary motion from the SNP and criticism from Conservative lawmaker Robert Jenrick, is growing to formally strip Prince Andrew of his titles and remove him from public life. The memoir underscores the enduring impact of sexual abuse allegations and the ongoing call for accountability within the British royal family.",
