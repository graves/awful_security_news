    "New Jersey is experiencing a close gubernatorial race in November 2025 between Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite the state’s historically blue political leanings.",
    "The race has become increasingly personal, with both candidates attacking each other’s past: Ciattarelli blames Sherrill for being barred from walking at her Navy Academy graduation due to a cheating scandal, while Sherrill accuses Ciattarelli’s former medical company of downplaying opioid dangers and claims he caused tens of thousands of deaths.",
    "Sherrill has received support from national figures like former President Barack Obama, while Ciattarelli has gained endorsement from President Donald Trump, who previously criticized him in 2016.",
    "Affordability and rising costs, including a 17–20% surge in electricity bills in June 2025, are central concerns for voters.",
    "Both candidates have emphasized cost of living and affordability, with supporters citing Sherrill’s plans to build housing and freeze energy costs, and Ciattarelli’s background as an accountant to address property taxes.",
    "Political experts note that New Jersey has a history of purple gubernatorial elections, with no governor elected from the same party for three consecutive terms since the 1960s.",
    "Sherrill’s win would mark the first time since the 1960s that a New Jersey governor has served three terms from the same party."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial election, a closely contested race is unfolding between Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite New Jersey’s historically blue political identity. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, has gained national support including from former President Barack Obama, and emphasizes affordability, energy costs, and opposition to Trump-aligned policies. Ciattarelli, a former Assembly member and pro-Trump figure, has received endorsement from President Donald Trump, despite past criticism of Trump, and focuses on fiscal management and tax reform. The campaign has become highly personal, with accusations over Sherrill’s military graduation and Ciattarelli’s role in opioid-related publications, including claims of mass deaths. Experts note that New Jersey’s gubernatorial elections are traditionally purple, with no three-term governor from the same party since the 1960s. Voter concerns center on rising living costs, especially electricity bills that surged 17–20% in June 2025. Ultimately, the race hinges on who can best communicate a compelling message about affordability and economic stability.",
