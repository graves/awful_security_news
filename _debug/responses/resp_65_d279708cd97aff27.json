  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite not being on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a powerful political force in the November 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Mikie Sherrill are both leveraging Trump’s policies—such as the termination of the Gateway tunnel and global tariffs—to energize their bases and frame the races as a direct test of public trust in Trump’s second term. Democrats are particularly concerned about voter shifts in areas like Passaic County, where Trump gained ground in 2024, and are banking on 'voters’ remorse' to mobilize disillusioned supporters. Meanwhile, Republicans are strategically using Trump’s influence to rally his base, while emphasizing that the races are about local governance. These elections are seen as early indicators of broader political trends, with potential implications for the 2026 midterm elections and control of Congress.",
