  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a Philippine island along the Pacific coast, have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, bringing heavy rainfall and a moderate risk of coastal flooding from up to 1.2-meter waves. The storm's eye is forecast to pass near the island later on Saturday, prompting local officials to activate evacuation plans in high-risk coastal, low-lying, and landslide-prone areas. This evacuation is part of a recurring drill, as Catanduanes has historically been the first landmass affected by western Pacific cyclones. The Philippines faces frequent extreme weather events—on average 20 storms and typhoons annually—exacerbated by climate change, which is intensifying storm power. The region is still recovering from a recent series of deadly earthquakes, including a 6.9-magnitude quake in Cebu and a 7.4-magnitude event off the southern coast, both of which triggered tsunamis and deaths, highlighting the complex and persistent natural disaster risks the country endures.",
