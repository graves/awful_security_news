  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false and unscientific claims linking autism to circumcision and the use of acetaminophen (Tylenol), citing two flawed studies and an unpublished 2025 preprint from WPLab. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, clarify that neither the 2013 nor 2015 studies established a causal link; both showed only weak correlations and had significant methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes and lack of data on drug use. The 2025 WPLab paper, which claims acetaminophen triggers autism, has not been peer-reviewed and is not supported by scientific consensus. Acetaminophen remains safe when used as directed, and decades of research show no link to autism. Kennedy’s claims, which were amplified on social media platforms like X, reflect a dangerous misinformation campaign that undermines public health guidance and misrepresents scientific evidence.",
