    "Donald Trump frequently uses the phrase 'common sense' to justify policy positions, such as recommending pregnant women avoid Tylenol and dismissing the jobs report as rigged.",
    "The phrase has deep historical roots, originating in Thomas Paine's 1776 pamphlet 'Common Sense,' which advocated against British rule and established a populist appeal based on everyday lived experience.",
    "Trump's use of 'common sense' is more frequent than any other political figure, and is used to contrast elite or academic viewpoints with a 'common person's' intuitive understanding of reality.",
    "The concept appeals strongly to rural communities, older voters, and those who value traditional, simple values, aligning with Trump’s base and the 'Make America Great Again' narrative.",
    "Democrats also use the phrase, such as President Barack Obama's 'common sense gun reform' and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's reference to healthcare affordability as 'common sense,' showing bipartisan usage.",
    "The phrase can be seen as demagogic—Trump uses it to dismiss opposing views as 'nonsense' or 'ideological,' suggesting no real debate exists.",
    "Trump uses 'common sense' to rationalize controversial or norm-shattering actions, like deploying the National Guard to cities, framing them as simple, necessary fixes rather than radical interventions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the political use of the phrase 'common sense' in U.S. politics, particularly under President Donald Trump. It traces the phrase’s origins to Thomas Paine’s 1776 pamphlet, highlighting its populist appeal. Trump uses the phrase frequently to justify controversial positions—such as advising against Tylenol for pregnant women, dismissing economic data as rigged, and justifying the deployment of the National Guard to cities. The article notes that 'common sense' is used by Democrats too, including Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to advocate for policy reforms. However, Trump's usage is more frequent and is often framed as a demagogic tool to dismiss opposing views as 'nonsense' or 'ideological,' reinforcing a binary of common sense versus elite or academic elitism. The phrase resonates strongly with rural and older voters, aligning with Trump's base and the 'Make America Great Again' ideology.",
