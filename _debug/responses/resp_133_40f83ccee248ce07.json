  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in 20 years, won a decisive 54.5% of the vote in a runoff election, ending decades of leftist rule under Evo Morales. In a major shift, Paz pledged to rebuild diplomatic ties with the United States, reversing years of hostility and signaling openness to foreign investment and fuel imports. He rejected an IMF bailout, citing public resentment, and plans to restructure fuel subsidies by targeting poor families with cash transfers while maintaining fuel prices for transport workers. His campaign, energized by populist running mate Edman Lara—a former police captain who gained fame on TikTok—successfully appealed to rural and working-class voters. Despite promises of reform, the new administration faces strong opposition from Indigenous communities and political factions, especially over proposed constitutional changes that could undermine political representation. Protests erupted in La Paz and Santa Cruz, fueled by past electoral frauds and distrust in democratic institutions. Paz’s inauguration on November 8 marks a pivotal moment in Bolivia’s political evolution, reflecting broader regional shifts toward conservative, pro-Western governance.",
