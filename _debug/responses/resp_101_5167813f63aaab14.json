  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under the Biden-Harris administration, has exited the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent. In her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,' she argues that internal disunity, including public doubts from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney about President Biden’s fitness, and systemic bias against Black women leaders, weakened the Democratic Party’s unity and electoral prospects in 2024. She reflects on her observations during the June 2024 debate, where she noted Biden appeared unwell, but insists she had no reason to doubt his fitness. Jean-Pierre also highlights the loyalty of Black women and other marginalized communities to the party, which she believes was overlooked. She attributes the party’s defeat to failure in foresight, particularly regarding anti-DEI and anti-immigrant policies like Project 2025. Her decision to become independent is not a political defection but a call for greater accountability, transparency, and a reimagining of American politics beyond partisan lines, urging citizens to engage actively to prevent silence from becoming complicity.",
