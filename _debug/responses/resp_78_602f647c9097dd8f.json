    "Scientists have long been puzzled by a mysterious, diffuse glow of gamma rays detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008.",
    "The glow’s shape — matching the galactic bulge — previously favored the pulsar theory over dark matter, as dark matter was expected to produce a more spherical glow.",
    "New supercomputer simulations show that dark matter collisions could create a squashed, egg-shaped distribution that closely matches the observed glow, lending support to the dark matter theory.",
    "Joseph Silk, a physicist from Johns Hopkins University, co-authored a study in Physical Review Letters showing that dark matter in the Milky Way may be shaped like an egg, not a perfect sphere, which better matches the observational data.",
    "The paper suggests a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter, compared to older stars (pulsars), indicating a significant shift in scientific confidence.",
    "Dark matter, first theorized by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s and confirmed by Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford in the 1970s, remains undetected directly despite decades of research.",
    "WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) are a leading dark matter candidate; their annihilation could produce gamma rays, potentially explaining the glow.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), under construction in Chile and Spain, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data starting in 2027 and could definitively confirm or reject the dark matter link.",
    "While the new simulation strengthens the dark matter hypothesis, scientists like Tracy Slatyer and Chamkaur Ghag acknowledge the possibility of other explanations, and the search for WIMPs continues to be a central goal in modern physics."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists have long debated the origin of a mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008. While the glow’s shape initially suggested it came from pulsars — old stars that emit gamma rays — new supercomputer simulations now show that dark matter collisions could produce a squashed, egg-shaped distribution matching the observed glow. Led by Joseph Silk of Johns Hopkins University, the research suggests a 50% chance that the glow stems from dark matter, particularly WIMPs, which annihilate and produce gamma rays. This supports a long-standing hypothesis that dark matter, first proposed by Fritz Zwicky and confirmed by Vera Rubin, might be detectable through astronomical signals. However, definitive proof hinges on future observations from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to begin in 2027, which will offer higher-resolution data to confirm or rule out the dark matter link. The article underscores that identifying dark matter remains one of the most fundamental unsolved mysteries in physics and that the glow at the galactic center may hold a key to unlocking its nature.",
