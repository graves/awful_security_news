  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, Israel and Hamas have made significant progress in releasing hostages and detainees. However, a major dispute persists over the return of the bodies of 28 deceased Israeli hostages, with Hamas releasing only nine remains and Israel alleging that Hamas holds at least six more. Despite US assurances that Hamas is fulfilling its commitments, Israel believes it has access to hidden bodies and is pushing for a full search mechanism. International actors including Turkey and the United Nations are involved in efforts to locate remains and prevent humanitarian aid from being used as a bargaining tool. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirms that the 'struggle is not over,' vowing to bring back all hostages and maintain military pressure, while the ceasefire remains incomplete due to unresolved issues over Hamas disarming and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
