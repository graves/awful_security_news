  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, during which thousands of websites and apps—ranging from banking services to social media and airline booking platforms—became inaccessible for several hours. The outage stemmed from a failure in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from reaching data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB database, effectively disconnecting apps from their data. Although AWS has not had a major outage in years, experts warn that the incident highlights a critical vulnerability: the internet’s heavy dependence on a small number of cloud providers. Past incidents, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures, demonstrate that such disruptions are not isolated and can lead to massive economic and social consequences. Experts believe the cause was likely a technical fault, not a cyberattack, and suggest that the internet’s original decentralized design has been compromised by the concentration of services in few cloud regions. AWS has since resolved the issue and recommended clearing cached data to restore services, while it plans a postmortem to determine the exact cause.",
