  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation and land grabs in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, especially in Pará. The investigation finds that cattle from illegally deforested land are moved through a 'laundering' system, using Brazil’s incomplete GTA (Guias de Trânsito Animal) tracking system to conceal their origins, making it impossible for JBS to verify the legality of its supply chain. Despite previous promises made in 2009 to trace indirect suppliers, JBS has failed to meet those commitments. The report highlights the severity of deforestation in Pará—up 421% in 2024—and documents violent land invasions in protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where state agency Adepará authorized cattle transport without environmental oversight. Experts and advocacy groups argue that voluntary corporate actions are insufficient and call for mandatory, publicly accessible, and enforceable national traceability systems. This report is especially significant as it is published just before COP30, where Brazil will host the UN climate summit, underscoring agriculture’s role in Amazon deforestation and the urgent need for accountability in global supply chains.",
