  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range weapon used in multiple global conflicts, is being considered by Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has advocated for its delivery to counter Russian attacks and pressure Moscow into negotiations. However, the US has restricted supply due to domestic defense needs, with President Donald Trump stating that Tomahawks are essential for US security. Russia has reacted with alarm, viewing the supply as a hostile act that could escalate the conflict or threaten global stability. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-based launcher (the Typhon) to operate the Tomahawk, and its own missile program, the Flamingo, remains unproven and underdeveloped. While a few dozen Tomahawks could damage key Russian infrastructure like the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, large-scale strikes would require hundreds of missiles. In the meantime, Ukraine's primary military priority remains robust air defense due to sustained attacks by Russian drones and missiles, and Zelensky is pursuing a $90 billion weapons deal with US manufacturers to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities.",
