  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Millions of people across the United States participated in 'No Kings' protests against President Donald Trump, with major gatherings in New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles. Protesters, many of whom expressed concern over expanding executive power, immigration crackdowns, and healthcare cuts, used slogans such as 'Democracy not Monarchy' to oppose what they see as an authoritarian drift. While Trump dismissed accusations of dictatorship as hysterical, critics argue his actions—including deploying National Guard troops and using executive orders to weaken federal institutions—threaten constitutional democracy. The protests were largely peaceful, with no arrests reported, despite warnings from Trump allies that they were linked to Antifa. Key political figures like Senator Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy supported the demonstrations as a defense of American values. Republican governors in several states activated the National Guard in anticipation, though no violence occurred. The protests also drew international attention, with demonstrations in Europe showing solidarity with US demonstrators and highlighting global concerns about democratic erosion.",
