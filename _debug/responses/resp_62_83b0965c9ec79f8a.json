  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A coalition of seven major U.S. universities, including MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, the University of Virginia, and the University of Arizona, have rejected a White House proposal offering expanded federal funding in exchange for policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes. The compact, which includes mandatory annual anonymous polling for compliance, is seen by universities as a threat to academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The Trump administration claims the initiative promotes a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and offers competitive federal advantages, but institutions argue it undermines free inquiry and innovation. The deadline for initial signatories is set for November 21, 2025, with ongoing debate over whether federal control of academic policy is appropriate or detrimental to the core values of higher education.",
