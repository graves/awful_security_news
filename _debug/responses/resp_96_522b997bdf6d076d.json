  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Podcast host Joe Rogan expresses surprise at the extent of President Donald Trump’s militarized mass deportation campaign, noting it was not something he foresaw despite Trump’s long-standing rhetoric about aggressive immigration enforcement. The article argues that while many Americans initially believed Trump would pursue certain policies — such as deporting millions, imposing tariffs, or using the Justice Department against political opponents — they often underestimated the severity and scope of his actions. Polling data from CNN, New York Times-Ipsos, Reuters-Ipsos, AP-NORC, and CBS News-YouGov shows a significant decline in public confidence in Trump’s adherence to campaign promises, with 53% of independents and 1 in 5 Republicans now believing he is not fulfilling his pledges. In particular, Trump’s pardon of nearly all January 6 defendants, including violent offenders, far exceeded public expectations. The article concludes that while Trump’s actions may appear consistent with his campaign, they have surprised many Americans and are now perceived as going 'too far,' with 48% of the public believing his actions are worse than expected.",
