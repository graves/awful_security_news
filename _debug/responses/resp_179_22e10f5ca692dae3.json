  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives from Meta Platforms, Snap, and Instagram are required to testify in a landmark U.S. trial over the mental health impact of social media on young people. The case, consolidated in 2022 from hundreds of claims by parents and school districts, alleges that companies designed addictive features—such as 'likes'—and failed to implement effective parental controls or safety measures despite knowing of mental health risks. Although the companies previously argued that federal laws shield them from liability for user content and that in-person testimony would harm business operations, Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled that CEO testimony is essential to evaluate claims of negligence in app design. The ruling underscores growing legal and public pressure on social media firms to address youth mental health concerns, with plaintiffs asserting that companies deliberately maintained harmful features due to business concerns.",
