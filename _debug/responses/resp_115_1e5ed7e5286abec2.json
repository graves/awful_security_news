  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced the termination of U.S. aid to Colombia and the imposition of new tariffs on Colombian exports, accusing President Gustavo Petro of enabling drug production and calling him an 'illegal drug leader.' The U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed a strike on a vessel linked to the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group, though no evidence was provided. Petro strongly rejected these claims, accusing the U.S. of violating Colombian sovereignty, assassinating a civilian fisherman named Alejandro Carranza, and conducting illegal military strikes. Colombia, a long-standing U.S. ally and top recipient of foreign assistance, faces a deepening crisis as U.S. aid dropped from over $700 million to $230 million. Experts warn that this escalation risks undermining regional stability and military cooperation, especially during heightened tensions with Venezuela. The conflict reflects a broader U.S. strategy in Latin America focused on drug interdiction, but at the cost of strained diplomatic and military ties with key allies.",
