  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warns that public pressure will force Congress to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025. Without extension, millions of Americans—especially those earning under $63,000 annually—will face premiums rising by up to $2,000 per month, potentially reaching over $24,000 annually, making health insurance unaffordable. Jeffries criticizes Republican proposals for a one-year subsidy extension, arguing they are insufficient and tied to broader policies that benefit billionaires at the expense of working-class health access. He highlights concerns over Medicaid cuts and the lawlessness of allowing the President to unilaterally decide who receives pay during the shutdown. Jeffries stresses that without a bipartisan solution, tens of millions will be forced to drop out of coverage, leading to rising costs and health system instability. The article underscores the urgency of action during the open enrollment period, which runs through mid-December, as public awareness grows about the financial impact of subsidy expiration.",
