  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is facing criminal charges for allegedly lying during congressional testimony, with his legal team launching a defense strategy arguing that the prosecution is a retaliatory personal vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was illegal under the U.S. Constitution. Comey’s attorneys claim that Trump’s public attacks on him and the circumvention of Senate confirmation requirements by appointing Halligan after the 120-day interim term expired violate constitutional principles and establish a pattern of vindictive prosecution. They also draw on the precedent of Jack Smith’s unlawful appointment in Trump’s Florida case to support their argument that Halligan’s appointment lacks legal authority. The case is significant because it raises broader constitutional questions about executive power, retaliation, and the independence of the justice system, especially in politically charged environments.",
