  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a reported Gaza ceasefire deal being hailed as a diplomatic win, public support for President Donald Trump has not improved. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC shows that while Trump’s approval on Gaza slightly increased, disapproval remains high — with overall approval at a second-term low. The article emphasizes that Americans are more concerned about economic issues like inflation and the cost of living, which have deteriorated under Trump’s policies, than about foreign policy achievements. Public skepticism is further fueled by the short-lived nature of previous peace deals and a general sense of economic pessimism, such as declining expectations for wage growth and economic improvement. As a result, the Gaza deal appears to have had little impact on Trump’s domestic political standing, reinforcing the idea that economic performance remains the dominant factor in public opinion.",
