  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following Diwali celebrations, New Delhi experienced one of the most severe air pollution episodes in the world, with PM2.5 levels exceeding the World Health Organization’s safety guidelines by over 40 times. This spike is attributed to widespread use of traditional fireworks and firecrackers, despite a 2020 ban and a limited permit for 'green' firecrackers that were poorly enforced. Residents report serious health effects, including eye and throat irritation, while officials continue to struggle with long-term pollution control due to inadequate enforcement and systemic coordination. The crisis is part of a broader environmental issue in India, with other major cities like Kolkata and Mumbai also ranking among the world’s most polluted. This reflects a pressing need for stronger, consistently enforced environmental policies in urban centers to protect public health and address climate and air quality challenges.",
