  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "London police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, in 2011, instructed a bodyguard officer to investigate Virginia Giuffre’s criminal record to smear her reputation, following allegations that she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. This comes after revelations that Andrew maintained contact with Epstein as late as February 2011, contradicting his earlier claims. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, had filed a civil suit against Andrew, which was settled in 2022. While Andrew denied wrongdoing and acknowledged her suffering, public and political outrage intensified, leading to his formal relinquishment of royal titles. The investigation and subsequent media attention—including Giuffre’s posthumous memoir—underscore a broader crisis of accountability within the British royal family, prompting calls for King Charles III to strip Andrew of his title and for ethical scrutiny of how public institutions are used in smear campaigns.",
