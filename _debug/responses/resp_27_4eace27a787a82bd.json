As a member of the ultranationalist group Nippon Kaigi, she advocates for revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and strengthening military policy. Despite facing significant domestic and international challenges—including a shrinking workforce, high inflation, public distrust in the LDP, and strained relations with China—she has positioned herself as a modern conservative leader through policies like 'Sanaenomics,' echoing Shinzo Abe’s economic model. Her foreign policy, while initially confrontational with China, may moderate to avoid diplomatic friction. Her rise signals a pivotal shift in Japan’s political landscape, with both promise and risk as she navigates economic, social, and geopolitical complexities.",
