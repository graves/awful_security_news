    "Democrats are demanding an extension of enhanced Obamacare subsidies, a policy that is popular with the public—72% of Americans and 51% of Republicans support it.",
    "Despite being in a prolonged shutdown, public opinion polls show that Americans blame Republicans more than Democrats, contradicting claims by President Donald Trump that Democrats are 'getting killed in the polls'.",
    "Historically, in past shutdowns, the party making policy demands (e.g., Republicans in 1995–96 and 2018–19) lost public support and eventually gave in, while Democrats were blamed in earlier rounds.",
    "The current situation is unusual because Democrats are making a popular policy demand, which may give them political strength, and they are not losing public support despite the shutdown.",
    "The looming impact of doubled Obamacare premiums after open enrollment on November 1 could pressure Democrats to back down, but also may motivate them to hold out, especially if Republicans fear responsibility for rising costs.",
    "If Democrats concede, their base may view it as a failure of leadership, which could hurt their political standing. If they persist, they may gain public sympathy and political leverage by showing resolve."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The federal government shutdown has reached its 21st day, with possible extension into early November, potentially setting a new record. Despite President Donald Trump claiming Democrats are losing public support, polling consistently shows Americans blaming Republicans more than Democrats. The Democrats are demanding an extension of Obamacare subsidies, a policy widely supported by the public—72% of Americans and 51% of Republicans. Historically, parties making unpopular policy demands (like Republicans in prior shutdowns) have lost political ground and eventually gave in. In contrast, this shutdown is unusual because Democrats are making a popular demand and maintaining public support. The November 1 open enrollment deadline looms, with potential premium hikes of up to double in many cases, which may pressure Democrats to back down or give them leverage to hold out. The outcome is politically significant, as it could influence public perception of party leadership and policy effectiveness.",
