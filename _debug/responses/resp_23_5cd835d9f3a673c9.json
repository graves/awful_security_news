  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a high-stakes legal battle following the April 2025 Canadian federal election, a one-vote margin in the Terrebonne electoral district—won by Liberal candidate Tatiana Auguste—has been challenged due to an administrative error: a postal code mistakenly printed on dozens of ballots by Elections Canada. Voter Emmanuelle Bossé’s ballot, returned uncounted due to the error, was reportedly cast for the Bloc Québécois, and her claim that her vote could have changed the outcome has sparked a judicial recount and a three-day hearing in Quebec’s Superior Court. While the initial vote count showed Auguste winning by one vote, the legal dispute centers on whether the result should be upheld or overturned, with Bloc Québécois lawyer Stéphane Chatigny arguing it undermines public trust and Liberal lawyer Marc-Étienne Vien claiming it violates the right to vote. Elections Canada’s lawyer, David Baum, noted that errors are inevitable in large-scale systems, but the case raises broader questions about electoral integrity and public confidence in democratic processes.",
