  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "CVS experienced a network system outage on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, which prevented some of its pharmacies from filling prescriptions or delivering medications to customers. The company confirmed the issue in a public statement, apologized for the inconvenience, and stated that the system was restored. The outage occurred amid a broader global concern over digital infrastructure reliability, highlighted by a previous major AWS outage that disrupted essential services such as hospital communications, banking, and smart home systems. While CVS acquired around 60 Rite Aid locations recently, there is no clear link between that acquisition and the technical failure. The incident underscores the vulnerability of society when critical cloud-based systems—used in healthcare, finance, and daily life—fail unexpectedly.",
