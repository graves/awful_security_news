  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying over 4,500 Marines and sailors, F-35 fighter jets, drones, and numerous naval assets, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and AC-130J Ghostriders. These deployments, including the reopening of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, are part of a broader strategy under the Trump administration to pressure Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, primarily through a combination of military show of force, surveillance, and potential Tomahawk missile strikes. While the U.S. does not have sufficient troops for an invasion, experts argue the buildup is a strategic signaling campaign designed to rattle Venezuela, deter drug trafficking, and assert influence in the region. Military activity includes live-fire training, B-52 bomber flyovers near Venezuela, and the diversion of intelligence assets from Eastern Europe. The actions are widely interpreted as a demonstration of power rather than a direct invasion, with Venezuela’s defensive capabilities and terrain posing significant challenges to any large-scale incursion.",
