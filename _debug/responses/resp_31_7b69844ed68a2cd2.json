    "The Kremlin has expressed concern that supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine could be seen as a hostile act, threatening global security, with Russian officials like SVR head Sergey Naryshkin warning of potential war escalation.",
    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly advocated for Tomahawk delivery, claiming they would strengthen Ukraine’s position and force Russia to negotiate.",
    "Ukraine has also developed a domestic cruise missile called the Flamingo, which is said to have a similar range but lacks proven capabilities and production capacity.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range strike weapon with a range of 1,600 to 2,500 kilometers and advanced guidance systems, remains a strategic option for Ukraine to strike deep within Russian territory. However, Ukraine currently lacks the required ground-launch system (the Typhon) and has not received sufficient Tomahawk missiles from the United States due to U.S. domestic constraints, notably stated by former President Donald Trump. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently advocated for Tomahawks as a way to strengthen Ukraine’s military posture and force Russia to negotiate, but Russia has warned that such a transfer would be perceived as a hostile act and could escalate the conflict. Although Ukraine has developed its own missile, the Flamingo, its capabilities and production capacity remain limited. While a few dozen Tomahawks could damage key Russian infrastructure like the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, the broader military context emphasizes that Ukraine's most urgent needs remain air defense systems due to increasing attacks from Russian missiles and drones. Zelensky is pursuing a $90 billion weapons procurement deal with U.S. companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, highlighting the strategic and geopolitical significance of the issue.",
