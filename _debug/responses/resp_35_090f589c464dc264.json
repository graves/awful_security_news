  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday. The storm poses significant threats to Hispaniola, particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic, due to the potential for over a foot of rainfall, leading to flash flooding and dangerous mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the East Coast may face rough surf and rip currents, with Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas at risk under certain scenarios. Melissa’s development is linked to climate change, as the warm Caribbean waters are fueling rapid intensification, a trend seen in hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. The storm’s track remains uncertain, with two primary scenarios: one turning northward toward Hispaniola, and another moving west toward Central America. Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, but tropical systems can still form afterward.",
