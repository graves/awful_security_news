  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris suffered a brazen daylight heist in October 2025, where thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery and stole high-value jewelry, damaging the crown of Empress Eugénie. The heist, which occurred in just seven minutes, is part of a broader pattern of security failures at the museum, including a 2019–2024 audit that revealed chronic delays in updating security systems and outdated infrastructure. The museum has faced repeated issues, such as overcrowding, water leaks, temperature fluctuations, and understaffing, which were highlighted in a 2024 internal memo by Louvre President Laurence des Cars. These problems were further exposed during a staff strike in June 2024. The museum’s historical vulnerabilities are underscored by past thefts, such as the 1911 'Mona Lisa' heist by Vincenzo Peruggia and the 1983 disappearance of 16th-century armor, recovered in 2021. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for a 10-year renovation, including a dedicated room for the 'Mona Lisa', to address long-term structural and operational challenges.",
