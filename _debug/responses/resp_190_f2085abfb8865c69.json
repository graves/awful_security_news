  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Pakistani national, Muhammad Pahlawan, was sentenced to 40 years in prison after being convicted of smuggling ballistic missile parts from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen using a fishing boat named Yunus. The weapons, described as highly sophisticated, were part of a larger operation coordinated by Iranian brothers Yunus and Shahab Mir'kazei, affiliated with Iran’s IRGC, a US-designated foreign terrorist group. Pahlawan’s crew, all from Pakistan, were unaware of the cargo and were threatened into silence. The operation was intercepted on January 11, 2024, during which two US Navy SEALs died. The smuggling route involved loading weapons in Iranian ports like Chabahar and Konarak, transferring them in the Arabian Sea, and then transporting them to Yemen. The Houthis' increased missile attacks on Israel and commercial shipping have severely disrupted Red Sea shipping, prompting a 60–70% drop in traffic and costly detours. US authorities accuse Iran of violating UN Security Council resolutions by supplying weapons to the Houthis, while Iran denies involvement. Pahlawan's actions, including threatening his crew and communicating his awareness of the danger, underscore the seriousness of the offense.",
