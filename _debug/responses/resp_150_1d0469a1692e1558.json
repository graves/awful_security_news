  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Colombian appeals court has overturned the 2018 conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe for fraud and witness tampering, citing structural deficiencies in the original verdict. The case, which stemmed from allegations of Uribe conspiring with paramilitary members to manipulate witness testimony, has deepened political divisions in Colombia. Critics, including current President Gustavo Petro, argue that the decision reflects a cover-up of historical right-wing abuses linked to paramilitary violence. The ruling has drawn significant international attention, particularly from U.S. officials like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, who have criticized Colombia’s judiciary as biased. Senator Ivan Cepeda has announced plans to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, and the case remains a key political issue as Colombia prepares for its 2026 presidential election. The legal battle has profound implications for Colombia’s political future, with potential effects on public trust in institutions and the broader narrative of accountability for past human rights abuses.",
