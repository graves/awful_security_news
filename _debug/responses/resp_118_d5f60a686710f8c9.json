  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI's release of Sora 2, an AI tool enabling hyperrealistic video and audio generation from text prompts, has sparked widespread concern among Hollywood studios, unions, and talent agencies. Users have created unauthorized AI-generated videos featuring real people—such as Martin Luther King Jr., Robin Williams, Michael Jackson, and Tupac Shakur—doing things they never did, leading to accusations of exploitation, disrespect, and copyright infringement. These videos have drawn strong criticism, including from Robin Williams' daughter Zelda, who called the content 'horrible slop'. Industry leaders, including SAG-AFTRA, United Talent Agency, and Creative Artists Agency, have condemned the lack of consent and compensation, calling such practices exploitation. In response, OpenAI has introduced an 'opt-in' consent policy, blocking the generation of well-known characters on its public platform and agreeing to remove non-compliant content. The industry is now pushing for federal legislation—the 'NO FAKES Act'—to require explicit consent before using real people’s likenesses in AI-generated content, building on California’s existing consent law. This reflects a broader ethical and legal debate over how AI technologies should respect human creativity, dignity, and intellectual property rights.",
