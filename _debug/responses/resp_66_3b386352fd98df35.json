    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, admitted to shooting Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter during a public greeting in Handlova.",
    "The court found Cintula guilty of terrorism, citing his intent to target a political leader, not a random civilian, and his ideological opposition to Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture.",
    "Fico, who was seriously injured, has continued public duties and has stated he has forgiven Cintula despite ongoing health issues.",
    "The case exposed deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the opposition of fueling public anger, while critics claim Fico has undermined democratic standards and media freedom.",
    "Cintula claims he aimed to stop Fico’s policies that he believes have damaged Slovak freedom and culture, calling the attack a 'scream against fear that is paralyzing the society'.",
    "The defense argued that not all attacks on public officials constitute terrorism, but the court ruled that the political targeting and intent justified the terrorism charge.",
    "The sentence is less than the maximum of life in prison, reflecting the court’s determination that while the act was severe, it fell short of the most extreme classifications of terrorism."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. Cintula, who admitted to shooting Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter, was found guilty of terrorism charges, not just murder, due to the political target and the ideological motivation behind the attack—opposition to Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. The verdict, delivered by the Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica, reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming opposition figures for creating public anger, while critics accuse him of undermining democratic norms. Despite the severity of the attack, the sentence is less than life in prison, and Fico has stated he has forgiven Cintula. The case underscores the tension between political activism and violence in modern democracies.",
