  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has formally renounced his royal titles and honours, including the Duke of York title, following intense public and media scrutiny linked to his alleged connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and victim Virginia Giuffre. The move, which was enforced by Buckingham Palace, marks a significant symbolic and structural distancing from royal life, with Prince Andrew expected to reappear at royal events only possibly in April 2026. While the decision aims to end the relentless media coverage and protect the broader royal family’s reputation, public and political scrutiny appears to persist, especially with the upcoming publication of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir and ongoing questions about Andrew’s business dealings with China and his prior interactions with Epstein. Despite the loss of status, Prince Andrew continues to live in Royal Lodge and maintains ties to his daughters, and has shown no remorse in public statements. Prince William has actively opposed Andrew’s royal involvement, and the broader context reveals that Andrew’s past comments on failure and learning from mistakes are now being questioned in light of the ongoing scandal.",
