  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against citizens using AI chatbots—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok—to determine their voting choices, warning that these tools provide distorted, polarized, and unreliable political advice. Tests conducted ahead of the October 29 parliamentary election showed that the AI models consistently recommended fringe parties like the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) and the left-wing Green Left-Labour Party, while largely ignoring centrist parties such as Democrats 66 and People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The watchdog argues that AI systems lack transparency and verifiability, and their use in voting decisions undermines democratic integrity. The warning comes amid rising political tension, with the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, expected to win the most seats but fail to secure a majority, as no major party is willing to support it in coalition government.",
