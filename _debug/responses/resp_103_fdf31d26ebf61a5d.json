  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study in the journal Pediatrics finds that reversing long-standing advice to avoid peanuts in infancy has significantly reduced food allergy rates in U.S. children, with a 43% drop in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergies since 2015. The shift was prompted by the 2015 LEAP study, which showed that early exposure to peanuts — such as through the Israeli practice of feeding infants a peanut snack called Bamba — reduced allergy risk, especially among children with genetic predispositions. This reversal in guidance, adopted by institutions like the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and reflected in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, has led to at least 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies over the past decade. Despite this success, implementation remains inconsistent due to parental fear and gaps in data collection, and experts note that peanut allergies are highly persistent, with only about 10% of cases resolving on their own.",
