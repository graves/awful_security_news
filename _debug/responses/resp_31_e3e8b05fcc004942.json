  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is actively scrutinizing federal law enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement campaign in Chicago that resulted in over 1,000 migrant arrests. In response to public and media concerns about excessive force and lack of transparency, Judge Ellis expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for agents during protests, particularly targeting ICE Special Response Teams which currently lack such equipment. The judge pressed federal officials—including CBP and ICE leaders—on the use of tear gas, training protocols, and the dissemination of her order. Testimony revealed that while agents are trained in crowd control and press handling, a pastor, David Black, reported being struck multiple times with pepper balls without prior warning. Federal leadership is described as unstable, with frequent personnel changes, and the judge plans to depose key figures such as Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino for further insight. The White House has denied reports of tear gas use, claiming media coverage is biased and selectively edited.",
