  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old hardline conservative and protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, has been elected Japan’s first female prime minister in a landmark political shift. Her rise signals a rightward turn in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which lost its coalition partner Komeito and now relies on a new alliance with the opposition Japan Innovation Party. Takaichi, a former TV commentator and motorcycle enthusiast, promotes nationalist policies, including revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and visiting a war shrine with convicted war criminals—actions that provoke diplomatic tensions with China and South Korea. She also opposes same-sex marriage and separate surnames, reflecting traditional values. As Japan faces soaring inflation, a declining birthrate, and public distrust in political institutions, Takaichi’s leadership will be tested in balancing economic reform, regional diplomacy, and internal political stability. Her cabinet includes Satsuki Katayama, the first female finance minister in Japan, and she plans to strengthen Japan-US relations through a planned meeting with President Donald Trump, emphasizing a 'strong economy' and 'national interests' through diplomacy and security.",
