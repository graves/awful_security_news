These changes are aimed at ensuring applicants are 'fully assimilated' and aligned with American values. USCIS officials argue the test was previously 'too easy,' while critics, including legal scholar Amanda Frost and advocacy groups like the Central American Resource Center, warn that these changes may disproportionately affect low-literacy individuals, reduce naturalization rates, and lack empirical support for claims of allowing unfit citizens to join the nation. The changes also require applicants to prove 'good moral character' through tangible evidence of contributions to society, with possible background checks involving coworkers or neighbors.",
