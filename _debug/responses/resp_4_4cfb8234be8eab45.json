  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, with significant threats of heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While the storm is unlikely to directly impact the U.S. mainland, there is a low chance of rough surf or rain in Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and marks the first storm to form in the Caribbean Sea, which has warmed due to climate change. This warming ocean fuel is driving stronger and faster storms, as seen in recent rapid intensification events with hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Forecasters are monitoring two primary track scenarios: one where Melissa turns north to impact Hispaniola and another where it moves west toward Central America. The storm’s exact path remains uncertain, but its potential impacts underscore the growing link between climate change and extreme weather events.",
