  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Skardu Valley, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual sounds, animal behavior, and using signal fires or gunfire—to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Despite government investments in early warning systems (EWS), such as the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems have failed to gain public trust due to malfunctions, lack of maintenance, and poor community engagement. In several incidents, shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain have successfully saved hundreds of lives using traditional methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and cultural embeddedness of human-based early warnings. Pakistan, which ranks among the world’s top climate-vulnerable nations despite contributing minimally to global emissions, faces rising temperatures and glacier melt, increasing the frequency of GLOFs. The article underscores a critical need to integrate traditional Indigenous knowledge into official disaster preparedness frameworks to build more resilient, community-trusted climate adaptation strategies.",
