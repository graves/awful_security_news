This financial strain threatens critical polio eradication activities, with the WHO’s director Jamal Ahmed warning that essential programs may not proceed. In response, the GPEI will focus resources on high-risk areas like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where wild polio cases have been reported, and adopt strategies such as fractional dosing to conserve vaccine supplies. The persistence of polio in these regions is due to asymptomatic transmission and low vaccination access, while vaccine-derived polio cases have also been recorded in countries like Nigeria. Despite the funding crisis, experts maintain that eradication remains achievable with sustained global commitment.",
