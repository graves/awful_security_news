  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines how the Trump administration has used the National Guard to support immigration enforcement, particularly in cities like Chicago, Memphis, and Washington, D.C., by blurring the lines between traditional law enforcement and immigration raids. Despite legal restrictions that prohibit the National Guard from making arrests, their deployment—often under federalized conditions—has created widespread fear among immigrant and local communities who cannot distinguish between ICE agents and military personnel. The administration's rhetoric consistently links crime and illegal immigration, a narrative that has gained political support but is not supported by data. Key actions include Operation Midway Blitz in Illinois, Operation Lone Star at the Texas-Mexico border, and federalized National Guard deployments in California and other states. Experts warn these actions are legally questionable and strategically designed to generate public fear and justify further enforcement, even as courts challenge their legality and residents express deep anxiety about safety and legal status.",
