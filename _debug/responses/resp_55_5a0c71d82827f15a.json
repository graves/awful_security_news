  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is challenging proposed FDA label changes that would warn against acetaminophen use during pregnancy due to potential links with autism or ADHD. The push originated from claims by former President Donald Trump, who suggested avoiding Tylenol without evidence. Despite assertions by the Informed Consent Action Network and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., scientific studies—including one involving over 2 million children and another reviewing 46 studies—show no causal link between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. The FDA maintains no clear evidence of harm, and regulatory bodies in the EU, UK, and Canada confirm the product's safety. Kenvue argues that the proposed changes are unsupported by science and would mislead the public, emphasizing that acetaminophen remains one of the most studied and safest medications for pain and fever during pregnancy.",
