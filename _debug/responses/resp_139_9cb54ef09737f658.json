The Colts held a 23-3 lead at halftime, stifling the Chargers’ rushing game and limiting them to just 10 rushing yards. Despite a strong second-half comeback from the Chargers, including three consecutive touchdowns, they ultimately lost due to a turnover on downs. Key defensive plays included Grover Stewart’s first career interception of Justin Herbert. Injuries to Colts’ DE Samson Ebukam and Chargers’ DL Otito Ogbonnia impacted both teams. The Colts now prepare to face the Las Vegas Raiders, while the Chargers travel to play the Minnesota Vikings.",
