  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products that would link its use during pregnancy to increased risks of autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that such a link exists, scientific evidence—including a large 2024 study of over 2 million children and multiple peer-reviewed analyses—shows no clear or causal relationship between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders. The FDA has not found evidence of harm from appropriate use, and international agencies including the EU, UK, and Health Canada confirm its safety. Kenvue argues that the proposed label changes are unsupported by science, arbitrary, and contrary to established medical guidelines. The debate reflects a broader tension between political messaging and scientific evidence in public health policy.",
