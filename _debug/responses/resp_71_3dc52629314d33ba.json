  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched legal efforts to dismiss federal charges alleging false statements and obstruction of Congress, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His legal team claims that Trump’s personal attacks on Comey and the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan—after the 120-day limit for such appointments expired—violates the U.S. Constitution by circumventing Senate confirmation and enabling executive overreach. The defense cites Trump’s own indictment being dismissed for similar constitutional violations as precedent, asserting that the charges constitute an abuse of power and retaliation against protected speech. These arguments frame the case as a broader constitutional conflict between executive authority and democratic checks, particularly concerning prosecutorial independence and the role of Congress in confirming high-level judicial appointments.",
