  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown signs of recovery, increasing from 376 to 384 individuals in the past year, marking a slow but positive trend after a 25% decline between 2010 and 2020. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA report that four mother whales have produced calves, and some show shorter reproductive intervals, indicating improved breeding success. Despite these encouraging developments, threats such as ship strikes and fishing gear remain significant. Conservation experts emphasize the importance of sustaining current protections, especially in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along key migration routes. Environmental groups warn that weakening laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act could jeopardize the species’ recovery, calling on Congress to uphold scientific safeguards.",
