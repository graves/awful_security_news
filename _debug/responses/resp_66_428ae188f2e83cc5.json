  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Navy detained two survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, marking the first time the Trump administration has held individuals after a military operation targeting drug traffickers. The strike, confirmed by President Donald Trump, was the sixth known action against a suspected drug vessel and the first not to result in total casualties. The operation, which involved the CIA and U.S. Southern Command, is part of a broader effort to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over drug trafficking and resource access. The legality of the operation is in question, as the administration has not declared war and drug trafficking is traditionally treated as a criminal matter, not terrorism. The detention raises constitutional and legal concerns, including whether the military has authority to detain suspects without due process, and whether such actions can be challenged through habeas corpus petitions. The incident underscores a shift in U.S. foreign and military policy toward drug trafficking, with geopolitical implications involving Venezuela.",
