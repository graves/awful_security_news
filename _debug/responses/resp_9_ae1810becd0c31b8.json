  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A significant rise in car loan delinquency among subprime borrowers — those with credit scores below 670 — has occurred since 2021, reaching 6.43%, which is the highest level since the early 1990s and higher than during past recessions. This trend, driven by record car prices, high interest rates, inflation, and rising repair and insurance costs, has led to a surge in repossession activity, with default rates nearing 10% in September 2025. The financial strain is compounded by borrowers already behind on mortgage, rent, or student loans. In contrast, prime borrowers with strong credit scores show minimal delinquency, highlighting the 'K-shaped economy' where wealthier individuals benefit while lower-income consumers face deep financial hardship. Lenders are now using GPS tracking and ignition disabling to recover vehicles, signaling a crisis level in the auto finance market.",
