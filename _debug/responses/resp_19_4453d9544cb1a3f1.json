  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in American media, fashion, and politics, tracing its roots back to the 1880s Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and its deep entanglement with cultural conservatism. While cowboy aesthetics are now ubiquitous — seen in fashion campaigns, TV shows like 'Yellowstone' and '1923,' and Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour — the image is largely a mythologized construct, rooted in romanticized, nostalgic, and often whitewashed narratives. Historians and artists like Melynda Seaton and Richard Avedon highlight that the real history of cowboys includes Mexican, Native, and enslaved Black Americans, whose contributions have been historically marginalized. Though recent efforts by Black cowboys and artists like Gabriela Hasbun are bringing visibility to these realities, mainstream discourse continues to rely on outdated stereotypes. The trend is linked to political movements, especially conservative ideologies, where the cowboy symbolizes patriotism, individualism, and resistance to urban modernity. Despite this, the article concludes that the cowboy phenomenon is a living, evolving cultural tradition that reflects both national identity and ongoing social change.",
