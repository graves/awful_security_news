  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is actively investigating the federal government’s response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE deployment that led to over 1,000 arrests. She expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents on the ground to wear body-worn cameras during protests, especially when using force, due to concerns about lack of warnings and transparency. Testimony revealed that while CBP agents are required to use cameras, ICE Special Response Teams are not issued them and would need Congressional approval. ICE agents are trained in crowd control and handling of journalists, but a reported incident involving Pastor Rev. David Black being struck with pepper balls without warning has raised serious concerns about accountability. The federal leadership structure has been described as unstable with frequent changes in high-level officials, and federal officials have denied media reports of tear gas use without warning. The judge plans to continue questioning top officials, including former ICE field office head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino, to obtain a full account of events on the ground.",
