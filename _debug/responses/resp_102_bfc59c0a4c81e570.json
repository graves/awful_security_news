    "Enshittification is a process where internet platforms, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber, degrade in quality over time, shifting from user-friendly early stages to exploitative business and user practices.",
    "The theory is divided into three stages: (1) user acquisition via attractive pricing and network effects, (2) favoring business customers at user expense, and (3) extracting maximum profits through predatory pricing, data misuse, and algorithmic manipulation.",
    "Amazon is cited as having charged merchants junk fees, leading to a 45–51 cent loss per dollar earned, and cloning products to boost its own profits, while Facebook altered feeds to prioritize ads and boosted content, degrading user experience.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to a lack of competition and weak consumer protections, arguing platforms operate with impunity due to high switching costs and network effects.",
    "Solutions proposed include stronger antitrust enforcement, ending the consumer welfare standard, enabling 'right-to-exit' policies (e.g., taking e-books off Kindle), and enforcing interoperability (e.g., allowing third-party ink for printers or cross-platform messaging).",
    "Amazon and Facebook have denied key claims in the book, asserting their platforms have improved over time and that the 'junk fees' and product cloning are either non-existent or misrepresented."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article presents Cory Doctorow’s theory of 'enshittification,' a degradation of internet platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber, which begin with user-friendly services and evolve into exploitative models through three stages: user acquisition, business favoring, and profit extraction. Doctorow argues that companies operate with impunity due to network effects, high switching costs, and weak regulation. He points to specific harms, such as Amazon’s junk fees and Facebook’s ad-heavy feeds, and proposes solutions like stronger antitrust enforcement, a 'right-to-exit' policy, and mandatory interoperability. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, the theory has gained cultural traction, with recognition from the American Dialect Society and Merriam-Webster, underscoring its relevance in public discourse about digital platform ethics and regulation.",
