    "The U.S. Justice Department has brought its first federal terrorism case tied to the Trump administration's crackdown on Antifa, targeting two individuals, Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold (also known as Autumn Hill), accused of participating in a coordinated attack on a federal immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas.",
    "Prosecutors describe Antifa as a 'militant enterprise' composed of networks and small groups that espouse insurrection and propose violent attacks against the U.S. government, providing a legal framework for classifying the ideology as a terrorist organization despite its generally decentralized nature.",
    "The attack on July 4, 2025, involved fireworks, vandalism, and gunfire; a correctional officer was shot in the neck while responding to the incident, and two shooters fired at police officers before fleeing, with the group having planned the attack over days prior through group chats.",
    "Ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song, charged with attempted murder of a federal officer, allegedly purchased the weapons used in the attack, including firearms equipped with a binary trigger, and had suggested bringing a 'wagon' of armor and rifles to overwhelm law enforcement.",
    "Investigators recovered 10 guns, four of which were purchased by Song; some were left at the scene, indicating a level of preparation and logistical planning.",
    "The indictment alleges that the group's goal was to destroy U.S. government property and commit acts dangerous to human life with the intent of influencing U.S. policy."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department has brought its first federal terrorism case linked to its campaign against Antifa, charging Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold (also known as Autumn Hill) with being members of an 'Antifa Cell' that planned and executed a violent attack on a federal immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas. The alleged attack, which occurred on July 4, 2025, involved fireworks, vandalism, and gunfire, with one correctional officer wounded when a shooter opened fire as he approached the scene. Prosecutors allege the group had coordinated through group chats, sharing maps and discussing security vulnerabilities, and had planned to use weapons such as those purchased by ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song, including a firearm with a binary trigger to increase lethality. The case marks a significant step in the Trump administration’s designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, with prosecutors defining Antifa as a militant enterprise that espouses insurrection and seeks to destroy government property and endanger lives to influence U.S. policy.",
