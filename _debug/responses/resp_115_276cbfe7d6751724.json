  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article describes the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef and art installation off the coast of Miami Beach, Florida. Led by artist and cultural placemaker Ximena Caminos and coral expert Colin Foord, the project combines marine science and art to restore a historic coral reef that was lost in the 1970s due to beach sand replenishment. It features sculptures cast from marine-grade concrete—such as 22 cars arranged in a traffic jam—designed to become coral nurseries. Corals like gorgonians are cultivated in a nursery and transplanted onto the reef, where they will grow and transform the sculptures over time. The project is partially funded by a $5 million city bond and aims to raise an additional $6 million. It will include an onshore marine learning center and future phases, such as 57 giant starfish sculptures, to promote ecotourism, public education, and environmental resilience. The project is expected to take at least a decade to complete and is intended to become a symbol of Miami Beach’s commitment to environmental restoration and artistic innovation.",
