  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "City health officials from the Big Cities Health Coalition, representing major U.S. cities across both political landscapes, have issued a strong public endorsement of vaccination, criticizing federal agencies—including the CDC and HHS—for politically driven messaging and policy shifts. They express concern over declining vaccination rates, which have led to outbreaks like measles in South Carolina, and cite false claims from former President Donald Trump and recent changes to childhood immunization schedules as major contributors to public distrust. Despite the CDC’s scientific foundation, trust in the agency has dropped significantly, with only half of Americans now trusting it to provide accurate vaccine information. The coalition emphasizes that vaccines are essential for protecting children in schools and communities, and that local public health systems must collaborate across jurisdictions due to the interconnected nature of public health threats. As medical organizations like the AAP and ACOG diverge from CDC guidance, the article highlights a growing crisis of scientific credibility and public trust in national public health policy.",
