  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan's parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister on October 21, 2025, following a three-month political vacuum after the resignation of Shigeru Ishiba. Takaichi, a protégé of Shinzo Abe and a member of the ultraconservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), won the vote with 237 votes, defeating opposition leader Yoshikoko Noda. Her government is formed through a coalition with the rightwing Japan Innovation Party (Ishin no Kai), which lacks a majority and will require alliance-building with opposition parties to pass legislation. The coalition is criticized for its nationalist and revisionist policies, including support for male-only imperial succession, opposition to same-sex marriage, and controversial visits to Yasukuni Shrine—though Takaichi has toned down her rhetoric recently. The new government faces significant challenges, including economic instability and public skepticism, and must address rising prices and economic recovery by late December. Despite being the first woman in the role, Takaichi has not prioritized gender equality or diversity, and her leadership is seen as potentially unstable due to weak parliamentary majorities and internal party divisions.",
