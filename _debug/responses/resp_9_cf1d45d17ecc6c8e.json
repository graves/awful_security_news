  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two weeks after 23-year-old Philadelphia woman Kada Scott went missing on October 4, 2025, human remains of an unidentified female were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school. The remains are currently being evaluated by the medical examiner to determine if they belong to Scott. Police have linked her disappearance to Keon King, a 21-year-old man arrested and charged with both Scott’s kidnapping and a prior domestic kidnapping case involving assault. Tracking phone communications led investigators to King, who was the last person known to have contact with Scott before she went offline. A public tip led authorities to a gold 1999 Toyota Camry, believed to be connected to King and possibly used in the abduction. The investigation, led by the Philadelphia Police Department with FBI support, is focused on identifying a pattern of criminal behavior. The case has prompted widespread public appeals for information, with family members and officials emphasizing the urgency and emotional toll of the situation.",
