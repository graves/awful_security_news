  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, triggered by President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China claims these measures are a legitimate response to US economic and industrial targeting, particularly in maritime and technology sectors. The dispute builds on a history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export restrictions, with both nations using economic tools as part of broader national security strategies. Analysts note that China has demonstrated strategic foresight in its actions—particularly the timing of its rare earth controls ahead of a key US-China summit in South Korea—while the US appears to be using calibrated threats to maintain pressure. The situation reflects a deeper pattern of great power competition, where economic interdependence is weaponized, and both sides are prepared to escalate to protect their national interests. Experts suggest that while the US holds more economic leverage, China's strategic coordination may give it an advantage in negotiations, and the outcome will depend on how global markets and economic stability respond.",
