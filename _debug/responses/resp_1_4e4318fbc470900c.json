  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday, October 25. With extremely warm sea temperatures, Melissa poses a severe threat of flash flooding and mudslides in mountainous regions of Hispaniola, particularly in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While the storm’s exact track remains uncertain, two scenarios are being monitored: one involving a northward turn toward Hispaniola and another a westward movement toward Central America. A direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely but not impossible, especially if the storm weakens and turns north. Melissa highlights a growing trend of rapid intensification in hurricanes, tied to global warming and fossil fuel pollution, following recent examples like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. The storm underscores the increasing danger of late-season tropical systems and the need for continued public awareness and preparedness.",
