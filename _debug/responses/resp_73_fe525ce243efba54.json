  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private Hawker 800XP business jet, registered XA-JMR, crashed near Lansing, Michigan, during a test flight following scheduled maintenance conducted by Duncan Aviation. The crash, which occurred at approximately 5:08 p.m., was captured in audio by air traffic control, where pilots repeatedly requested stall recovery, suggesting possible aerodynamic stall or loss of control. The aircraft had not flown since March 25, 2025, raising concerns about maintenance and system integrity. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation, noting a striking similarity to a fatal crash in February 2024 involving a similar model jet during a test of stall warning systems. The crash killed all three on board, including two pilots and a maintenance representative. Public flight data shows a sudden descent to 24,000 feet per minute over a one-minute period, with the plane disappearing into the woods before a plume of smoke appeared. The incident underscores a recurring safety risk in business jet operations and raises critical questions about maintenance protocols and pilot training for high-risk maneuvers.",
