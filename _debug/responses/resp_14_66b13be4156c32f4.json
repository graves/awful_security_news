  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. military conducted its seventh strike on a vessel suspected of being linked to a Colombian terrorist organization in the Caribbean, killing all three individuals on board and claiming no U.S. casualties. This action aligns with a broader Trump administration strategy of treating drug cartels as terrorist threats, justifying lethal strikes without due process through a classified legal opinion. The strikes have sparked significant diplomatic friction, especially with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the U.S. of killing an innocent national and canceled U.S. aid. The policy has drawn bipartisan criticism from lawmakers like Senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, and Tim Kaine, who oppose the expansion of presidential war powers. The actions are also part of a larger geopolitical pressure campaign targeting Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, highlighting the intersection of drug trafficking, national security, and foreign policy.",
