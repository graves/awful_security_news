  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a gun, marijuana, and cocaine. The Trump administration defended the law, arguing that habitual drug users pose a public safety risk, especially during impaired encounters with law enforcement. However, lower courts have previously ruled that such prohibitions lack historical precedent, and Hemani’s legal team contends that the law is not rooted in history, especially given that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana. The case also gains political significance due to Hunter Biden’s prior conviction under the same law, which was later pardoned. The Supreme Court will likely hear arguments next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2026, potentially setting a landmark precedent on the limits of the Second Amendment in relation to drug use.",
