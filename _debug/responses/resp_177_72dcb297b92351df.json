  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Warner Bros Discovery, the media conglomerate owning HBO, CNN, and other networks, is exploring a potential sale following multiple unsolicited acquisition offers, including one from Paramount Skydance led by David Ellison. The company, burdened by debt and financial losses since its 2022 merger, is reviewing options to unlock asset value, with its rich intellectual property library—such as Harry Potter and Looney Tunes—making it highly attractive to streaming-focused buyers. While the company still supports a planned business split, leadership is now considering a full or partial sale. The Paramount bid is seen as having a strong chance of approval due to political ties with the Trump administration, which has been supportive of similar deals. The announcement has led to a 8% surge in shares, signaling market confidence and setting the stage for a potential bidding war, amid broader industry consolidation driven by streaming shifts and declining traditional TV audiences.",
