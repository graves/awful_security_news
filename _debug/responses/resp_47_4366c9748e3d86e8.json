  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly crash on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet CARRIS’s operational specifications and lacked required certification for passenger use. The investigation also uncovered serious maintenance failures, including false documentation of completed tasks and a non-compliant maintenance plan. Eyewitnesses described the derailment as chaotic and violent. While the interim findings are preliminary, they highlight critical safety lapses in public transport operations and point to urgent reforms needed in infrastructure oversight and accountability.",
