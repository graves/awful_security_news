  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year jail term at La Sante prison in Paris, becoming the first former head of a European Union state to be imprisoned. He was found guilty of criminal conspiracy for accepting millions of euros from Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi to fund his 2007 election campaign, a claim he has consistently denied. The presiding judge, Nathalie Gavarino, described the offenses as of 'exceptional gravity' and ruled that the conviction would stand even if an appeal is filed. Sarkozy will be held in solitary confinement with limited contact, and his lawyers have immediately filed a release appeal, which the court will review in two months. This moment marks a historic turning point in French political history, as it is the first time a former French head of state has been imprisoned since Nazi collaborator Philippe Petain. Supporters and family members protested outside his home, while Sarkozy expressed his innocence and referenced the novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as a symbol of justice and redemption.",
