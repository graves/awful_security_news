  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a strong warning against citizens using AI chatbots—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok—to determine how to vote, citing that these systems provide highly distorted, biased, and polarized political recommendations. In tests involving 1,500 fictitious voter profiles, the AI models consistently favored fringe parties like the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) and the left-wing Green Left, while largely ignoring centrist parties such as Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The authority emphasizes that AI advice lacks transparency and verifiability, directly threatening the integrity of democratic elections. This comes amid political instability in the Netherlands, where the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, has gained significant traction in opinion polls despite being unable to secure a majority. The warning urges both voters and AI developers to avoid using chatbots as voting guides to preserve informed, balanced democratic participation.",
