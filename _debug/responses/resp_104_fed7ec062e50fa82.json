    "Tech CEOs from major companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are making bold claims about AI's ability to generate code, citing potential for 50–90% code automation.",
    "Despite high rhetoric, many software engineers remain skeptical, citing lack of long-term efficiency gains, code quality issues, and instances where AI tools produce 'messy' or non-functional code.",
    "AI tools are most effective for short-term, repetitive, or prototyping tasks where accuracy is less critical, such as creating quick illustrated prototypes.",
    "There is growing concern that AI usage is being mandated in workplaces regardless of need, leading to what researchers call 'workslop' — where AI is used without purpose, increasing workload and reducing collaboration.",
    "Studies show mixed results: a METR study found that experienced open-source engineers used AI and took 19% longer to complete tasks, while a Danish survey reported a modest 6.5% time saving.",
    "Experts like Simon Willison emphasize that AI cannot replace human problem-solving and that the role of software engineers remains centered on designing systems that solve real-world problems.",
    "AI-generated code often requires human review and correction, and even advanced tools like Anthropic's 'agents' can go into 'death spirals' or get stuck in testing loops.",
    "Concerns about job displacement of junior software engineers and the environmental cost of training large AI models are also raising alarms among engineers.",
    "Companies like Amazon and Meta have internal mandates pushing for AI adoption, with some instances of employees being fired for insufficient AI tool usage.",
    "Y Combinator, a startup incubator that once supported diverse tech innovations, now exclusively focuses on AI, reflecting broader industry shifts toward AI-centric development."

Despite optimism from executives, the reality on the ground suggests AI is not automating software engineering as dramatically as claimed, and human oversight remains essential.",
