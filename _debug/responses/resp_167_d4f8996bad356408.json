  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI voice scam targeted wealthy Italian businessmen in early 2025, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to clone the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and falsely claiming to be in need of urgent financial assistance for kidnapped journalists. The scam, which leveraged advanced AI voice cloning techniques to mimic real human speech, resulted in only one victim—Massimo Moratti—transferring money. Research by Queen Mary University of London demonstrated that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants frequently mistaking them for authentic and even rating them as more trustworthy. Global losses from deepfake scams have surged to over $547 million by June 2025, and AI-generated content is being exploited for fraud, misinformation, and sexual abuse, including the industrialized creation of child sexual abuse material. This has prompted legislative action, such as US President Donald Trump’s 2025 law criminalizing the publication of AI-generated intimate images without consent. The article highlights both the alarming real-world consequences of AI voice technology and its potential beneficial applications, such as restoring speech for people with speech disabilities.",
