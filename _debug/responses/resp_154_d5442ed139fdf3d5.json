  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has intensified its military campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, with a surgical drone and missile strike on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 on October 10, 2025, destroying critical power and heating systems. This marks a shift in tactics—from scattered attacks to systematic targeting of power and gas facilities—aimed at leaving civilians defenseless during an expected harsh winter. Russia has modified its drones and missiles to evade Western air defenses, reducing interception success from 37% to 6% between August and September. Corruption within Ukraine’s anti-drone systems has further weakened defenses, with officials fraudulently inflating costs. Despite efforts, Ukraine’s infrastructure remains underprepared, with only sandbags and ineffective interceptors used instead of deep underground protection. As a result, residents are stockpiling power banks, heaters, and natural gas to survive blackouts. The attacks signal a new phase of warfare that prioritizes civilian suffering over battlefield gains.",
