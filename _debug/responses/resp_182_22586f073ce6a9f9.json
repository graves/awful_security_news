  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study has identified seven ancient skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia as likely Roman soldiers from around 1,700 years ago, possibly victims of the 260 CE Battle of Mursa during the Crisis of the Third Century. The skeletons, discovered in 2011 at the site of ancient Mursa (modern-day Osijek), show signs of blunt force trauma, arrow-like puncture wounds, and pulmonary disease, indicating violent deaths and illness in their final days. DNA analysis reveals a mixed ancestry and that none were from the local area. The site was originally a water well, and mass burials were rare in the Roman Empire, suggesting a large-scale massacre. The findings offer important insights into Roman military conflicts, burial practices, and the human cost of empire-wide crises.",
