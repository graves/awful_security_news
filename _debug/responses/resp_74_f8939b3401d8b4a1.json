  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year prison sentence at La Santé Prison in Paris for criminal conspiracy related to using Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors. This marks the first time a former head of state in modern French history has been imprisoned. Sarkozy claims innocence and criticizes the judicial process as politically driven, while his legal team requests early release. He is housed in the VIP wing of the prison, historically reserved for high-risk political or criminal figures such as Manuel Noriega, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and Jacques Mesrine. The case raises questions about political ethics, international campaign finance, and the role of judicial accountability in democratic societies.",
