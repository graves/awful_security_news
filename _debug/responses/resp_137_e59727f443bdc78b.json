  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to reduce shipping emissions by introducing a $380 per metric tonne carbon tax, due to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened sanctions on countries supporting the measure. This decision, which delayed implementation by at least 12 months, undermines international efforts to cut shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. Despite strong support from China, the EU, and other nations, opposition from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and shifts in votes from Argentina and Singapore weakened momentum. The move reflects broader tensions between climate action and fossil fuel interests, particularly under Trumpâ€™s administration, and raises concerns among climate-vulnerable nations and shipping industry leaders about the long-term sustainability and feasibility of decarbonization in global maritime operations.",
