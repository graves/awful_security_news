  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a rising trade conflict between the United States and China, triggered by China's expansion of rare earth export controls in October 2025, which the US attributes to unfair trade practices. In response, US President Donald Trump threatened a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, effective November 1, and accused China of trade hostility. China counters that the US has engaged in discriminatory practices and overreached in national security justifications. The article traces a history of trade wars, including reciprocal tariffs from 2018 to 2024, and previous US restrictions on Chinese tech firms like Huawei and TikTok. Experts argue that both nations are weaponizing economic interdependence, with China adopting a more strategic and organized approach, while the US struggles with coherence. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea adds diplomatic tension, with analysts suggesting that export controls are a pre-meeting move to gain leverage. The conflict underscores the deepening geopolitical competition in technology and supply chains, affecting global markets and economic stability.",
