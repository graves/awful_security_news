  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically low despite a US-brokered ceasefire, with only 750 tonnes of food entering daily—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to just two open border crossings: Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara. The WFP operates 26 food distribution points, far less than the 145 it aims to establish across Gaza. Humanitarian aid reaches northern Gaza only via southern routes, and the Rafah crossing remains closed, barring access to the north. Hamas has handed over 13 of 28 pledged bodies, but the situation remains fragile, with many Palestinians storing food due to fear of renewed conflict. The WFP stresses that opening all crossings is vital to prevent famine and save lives, with the US-brokered ceasefire and its 20-point plan serving as the foundation for sustained aid delivery.",
