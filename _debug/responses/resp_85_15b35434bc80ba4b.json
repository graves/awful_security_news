  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, as part of a $200 million project to build a 90,000-square-foot, state ballroom designed to seat 650 people. The initiative, long touted by President Donald Trump as a 15-year ambition, will replace the space historically used by first ladies and will feature a luxurious, gilded aesthetic reminiscent of Trump’s private clubs. The ballroom will maintain the neoclassical heritage of the White House, while marking a significant shift in the building’s function and appearance. Trump emphasized that the project has no zoning restrictions and can proceed immediately due to presidential authority. The White House has defended the demolition by referencing past renovations during the Truman administration, claiming that modernization is a necessary and historical part of the White House’s evolution. Critics have raised concerns about the scale and impact of the changes, but officials have dismissed such criticism as 'pearl clutching'.",
