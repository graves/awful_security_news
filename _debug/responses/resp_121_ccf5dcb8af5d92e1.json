  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III and former Duke of York, has formally announced that he will relinquish all royal titles and honors, including the Duke of York and his positions in the Royal Victorian Order and the Most Noble Order of the Garter. This decision comes in the wake of renewed public scrutiny following the release of a memoir by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who alleges she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and had a sexual encounter with Andrew when she was 17. Although Andrew has long denied any wrongdoing, a 2019 BBC interview in which he dismissed her claims and made insensitive remarks significantly damaged his reputation, leading to his removal from public duties. A 2022 court settlement acknowledged Epstein as a sex trafficker and Giuffre as a victim, but Andrew still maintains he does not recall meeting her. The controversy has been further amplified by allegations involving his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, who faced backlash over a reported email describing Epstein as a 'supreme friend,' leading to charities severing ties with her. Additionally, Andrew has been criticized for his financial habits, with reports linking him to businessman Tengbo Yang, a suspected Chinese spy barred from the UK. This latest move reflects a significant shift in public perception and marks a symbolic distancing of the royal family from figures associated with misconduct and controversy.",
