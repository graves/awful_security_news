  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in 20 years, won the presidential runoff with 54.5% of the vote, signaling a dramatic end to decades of leftist rule under the MAS party. His victory marks a shift in foreign policy, with Paz pledging to rebuild diplomatic ties with the United States and attract foreign investment, welcomed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He also reached out to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, signaling a new alignment with Latin American democratic movements. Amid a severe economic crisis—marked by 23% inflation, fuel shortages, and a near-empty central bank—Paz rejected an IMF bailout and has committed to restructuring fuel subsidies through targeted cash transfers for the poor. His economic team, led by José Gabriel Espinoza, has approved a $3.5 billion loan and plans another $600 million to stabilize finances. Despite winning, Paz faces challenges from former leftist supporters who warn against neoliberal policies and from public protests over election integrity, especially after past controversies like Morales’ disputed 2019 re-election. The article underscores a pivotal moment in Bolivia’s history: a conservative shift that could reshape its economy, foreign relations, and internal political dynamics, all while navigating deep social divisions and historical grievances.",
