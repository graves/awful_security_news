  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Colombia and Ecuador, under President Donald Trump's administration. The strike, which targeted a vessel believed to carry narcotics and contain four known narcoterrorists, resulted in two deaths and the detention of survivors. One survivor, Jeison Obando Perez, arrived in Colombia with severe injuries and is undergoing medical care and legal proceedings; another was received by Ecuador for medical evaluation and legal action. The operation marks the first time the Trump administration has detained individuals from such a strike. The US argues it has broad presidential authority under Article II to conduct strikes against 'narco-terrorists,' though this remains legally and politically controversial due to the absence of congressional war authorization. The actions have sparked diplomatic tensions, especially in Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro accused the US of violating territorial waters and killing a civilian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, on September 15. The broader context includes the US deploying military assets to the Caribbean to pressure Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro and disrupt drug trafficking flows, raising concerns about legal authority, civilian casualties, and international sovereignty.",
