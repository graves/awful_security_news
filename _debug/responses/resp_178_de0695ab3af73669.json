  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prabowo Subianto's first year as Indonesia's president has been marked by public protests over rising living costs, corruption, and inequality, as well as a major failure in the government's flagship free school meals programme, which has led to widespread food poisoning among children. Despite a $28 billion annual investment aimed at reducing child malnutrition and stimulating the economy, poor logistics, inadequate food safety standards, and reliance on third-party contractors have undermined its effectiveness. The situation reflects deeper issues in governance, public spending, and oversight, while also exposing Indonesiaâ€™s vulnerability to external trade pressures, including 19% US tariffs and competition from Vietnam and Malaysia. The government continues to defend its policies, including an ambitious 8% growth target by 2029, but critics question its feasibility, economic data integrity, and public trust. Meanwhile, the sacking of finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and the appointment of a less experienced successor raise concerns about political stability and economic management, even as new initiatives like the Danantara sovereign wealth fund aim to drive growth in green industries and digital economy sectors.",
