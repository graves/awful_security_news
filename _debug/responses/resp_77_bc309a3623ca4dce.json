Giuffre, who was allegedly trafficked by Epstein in 2001, died by suicide in April 2025, and her family welcomed Andrew’s relinquishment of royal titles but called for a full stripping of his title by King Charles III. Though Andrew acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering in a 2022 settlement, he continues to deny wrongdoing. The British government, including Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, has condemned the use of a close protection officer for such a purpose, emphasizing ethical concerns.",
