The aircraft was not in distress during approach, and there was no request for assistance. The airport suspended operations on the north runway, though other runways remain open, minimizing disruption to daily flights. The flight was assigned an Emirates flight number but wet-leased from ACT Airlines. Despite Hong Kong International Airport’s historically strong safety record, this incident highlights rare but critical risks in aviation operations.",
