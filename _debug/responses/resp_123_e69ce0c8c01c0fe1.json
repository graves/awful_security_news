  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The fourth plenum of the Chinese Communist Party, set to begin on October 19, 2025, marks a critical moment in shaping China’s economic strategy for 2026–2030. With leadership under Xi Jinping, the meeting aims to finalize policies amid growing trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who has intensified export controls and tariffs. Key economic priorities include achieving 4.8–5% growth, promoting technological self-sufficiency—especially in artificial intelligence and semiconductors—and revitalizing consumer spending through targeted subsidies. However, domestic challenges such as a property sector crisis, low consumer confidence, youth unemployment, and an aging population complicate these goals. Experts suggest that while the current plan follows familiar patterns, bolder reforms may be needed to address structural imbalances. The full five-year plan will be formally unveiled at the National People’s Congress in March 2026.",
