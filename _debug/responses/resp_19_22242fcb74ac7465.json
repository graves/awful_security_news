  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia has intensified drone attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, with repeated strikes designed to terrorize civilians and prolong humanitarian suffering. These attacks have led to widespread blackouts and fatalities, including in Novhorod-Siverskyi. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded by urgently calling on European allies for increased military and financial support, including using frozen Russian assets to fund air defense systems like the Patriot battery. Despite expectations of US Tomahawk missile support, Ukraine remains short on air defenses. Zelensky is also wary of a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, Russia’s closest European ally, and has emphasized that Ukraine remains the only party genuinely committed to peace. Analysts, including Tatiana Stanovaya from the Carnegie Endowment, note a pattern where Russian military escalation follows US frustration with Russia, suggesting a cyclical geopolitical dynamic.",
