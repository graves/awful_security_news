Despite US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren sourcing garments from these factories, they are not legally responsible for labor conditions. Workers face systemic barriers to unionization, threats, and violence, including the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal. Factory owners block inspections, and labor inspections are frequently obstructed. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face financial devastation after layoffs, with no pensions or severance. The article highlights a 'gendered supply chain shock' where women are disproportionately affected. Although Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo has introduced reforms, enforcement remains weak, and the future of these workers is uncertain amid global supply chain shifts and new US tariffs.",
