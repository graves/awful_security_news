  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A £28 million timeshare fraud involving over 3,500 elderly British victims was uncovered through secret filming by BBC Scotland Investigates in 2016. The company Sell My Timeshare (SMT) used a bait-and-switch scheme, misleading owners into paying large upfront fees for non-existent property resale options and instead offering fake 'Monster Rewards' credits. The investigation, led by journalist Fergus Muirhead, revealed that victims—many aged 60 to 80—were subjected to high-pressure sales tactics and left with unusable contracts and significant financial losses. Mark Rowe, the company’s top executive, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for conspiracy to defraud, while his wife Nicola received a suspended two-year sentence for money laundering. Nine years after the initial broadcast, 14 individuals were convicted in a series of trials at Southwark Crown Court, and the CPS is now pursuing the recovery of stolen assets. The case represents one of the largest consumer frauds in UK history and underscores the critical role of investigative journalism in exposing corporate misconduct.",
