  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated the construction of a $250 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, despite not securing formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that regulates major renovations. The demolition of part of the historic East Wing—built in 1902—has sparked controversy, with concerns over federal oversight, historic preservation, and transparency. Trump claims the project is privately funded, with no cost to taxpayers, and asserts it has been a long-standing desire of presidents, citing a planned capacity of 999 people. The White House has not disclosed full financial contributions, and while Carrier Global Corp. has donated HVAC systems, the lack of regulatory compliance raises questions about accountability. The project, scheduled for completion before Trump’s term ends in January 2029, is the largest structural change to the White House since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, and it has disrupted the traditional operations of the first lady’s office.",
