  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former Amazon delivery driver, Leah Cross, has filed a lawsuit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that the agency unlawfully abandoned her sex discrimination case — claiming Amazon fails to provide adequate bathroom breaks for female drivers — in response to a Trump-era executive order that deprioritized 'disparate impact liability'. The EEOC, which previously enforced civil rights laws through this legal doctrine, now claims to have dropped cases involving gender, race, and transgender status due to the executive order. Cross, who worked as a driver from August to November 2022, says she was forced to carry a portable urination device due to lack of access, and the lawsuit demands the EEOC reinstate investigations under the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The case is part of a wider trend where federal agencies, including the EEOC, have halted or deprioritized discrimination claims, especially those involving gender and identity, under Trump’s administration. The lawsuit highlights a conflict between legal obligations and political policy, with critics arguing that such changes undermine civil rights enforcement and create a precedent for dismissing valid claims based on political preferences.",
