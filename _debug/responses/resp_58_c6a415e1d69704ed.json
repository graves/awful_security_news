  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a recent call from US President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces continue to make gains in Ukraine, particularly in the Kupiansk and Vovchansk areas, using record numbers of drones and guided aerial bombs. Ukrainian forces report that about 20–30% of incoming drones go unintercepted, and they are actively defending key towns like Kupiansk against Russian infiltrations. While Russia claims advances, Ukrainian military leaders argue that these gains are minor and achieved at a high cost, with over 250,000 Russian soldiers reportedly killed or wounded. Russia is reportedly shifting recruitment strategies due to declining incentives and potential use of reserve forces. Ukraine is countering with long-range attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, disrupting one-fifth of its refining capacity. Analysts note that both sides remain entrenched, with neither achieving strategic victory, and President Vladimir Putin showing no willingness to negotiate, even after more than 1,300 days of conflict.",
