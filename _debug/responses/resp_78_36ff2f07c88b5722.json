    "The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the United States, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, has been undermined by a dispute over the return of the bodies of 28 deceased hostages held in Gaza.",

    "Despite the ceasefire, Israel still occupies about 50% of Gaza, and Hamas has not fully disarmed, leaving major unresolved issues under the terms of the agreement.",
    "Netanyahu reiterated that the 'struggle is not over' and that Israel will 'achieve all the goals of this war,' emphasizing that Hamas knows the price of aggression and that the victory is not yet complete."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a ceasefire agreement brokered by the U.S., Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, Israel and Hamas have reached a partial resolution involving the release of 20 living hostages and over 1,700 Palestinian detainees, but the dispute over the return of the bodies of 28 deceased hostages remains unresolved. Hamas claims to have delivered only nine of the remains, while Israel alleges that Hamas holds at least six more bodies, possibly hidden or inaccessible. The U.S. maintains that Hamas is fulfilling its commitments and is supporting efforts to locate the remains, including through Turkish expertise. Israel has backed down from threats to restrict humanitarian aid, allowing over 700 trucks into Gaza despite the agreement’s limit of 600 per day. Meanwhile, Netanyahu reiterated that the 'struggle is not over,' warning that any aggression against Israel will face severe consequences, and emphasized the need to 'bring back all the hostages.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for full compliance with the ceasefire, asserting that the mission is not complete and demanding that Hamas fulfill its obligations. The ceasefire remains fragile due to unresolved issues such as Hamas’s disarmament and Israel’s continued military occupation of 50% of Gaza.",
