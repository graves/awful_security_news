  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City Democratic primary marks a landmark moment for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), signaling a significant shift in American political dynamics. With a surge in DSA membership—reaching 80,000 nationally and 11,000 in New York City—and widespread public support for socialist ideals, especially among Democrats, the DSA is emerging as a major force in grassroots organizing and progressive politics. Mamdani’s campaign, rooted in slogans like 'FREEZE THE RENT' and 'CHILDCARE FOR ALL', has energized working-class voters and challenged the traditional Democratic establishment, including figures like Hakeem Jeffries and Andrew Cuomo. While the DSA remains internally divided over issues like Palestinian solidarity and ideological purity—most notably in its de-endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—the movement is expanding beyond its ranks. Candidates like Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson are following Mamdani’s model, using DSA energy to drive local campaigns. A Gallup poll from September 2025 confirms a growing public skepticism of capitalism and increasing support for socialism, suggesting a fundamental realignment in Democratic Party values and voter expectations.",
