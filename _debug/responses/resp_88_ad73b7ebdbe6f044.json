  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in modern American culture, driven by political conservatism, media trends, and fashion. It traces the origin of cowboy mythologizing to the 1880s Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and the romanticization of cowboys in Western films and politics. The current prevalence—seen in fashion, TV, and political discourse—is linked to cultural conservatism, particularly under the Trump administration, where cowboy symbolism represents rugged individualism and patriotism. However, the article critiques this image as a selective, whitewashed version of reality, ignoring the historical roles of Mexican, Native American, and enslaved Black Americans. It highlights the contributions of Black cowboys through Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour and photographer Gabriela Hasbun’s work on 'The New Black West,' showing a growing recognition of diversity in cowboy culture. Despite the mythologized aesthetic, the article concludes that the cowboy trend is cyclical, culturally resonant, and evolving, reflecting both national identity and ongoing social reckonings.",
