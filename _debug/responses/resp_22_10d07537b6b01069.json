  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling allows the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, overturning a prior lower court decision. The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, is challenged by a dissenting judge who warns it undermines state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. The administration claims the deployments are necessary to protect federal personnel amid protests over immigration policies, while state officials and legal experts argue the actions are unconstitutional, militarize civil dissent, and violate state authority. The ruling comes amid broader national efforts by Trump to deploy troops in cities like Chicago, Memphis, and San Francisco, all met with legal resistance, public protests, and constitutional concerns. A request for an en banc review is pending, and the Supreme Court is being asked to intervene in the Chicago case. The article underscores a growing national debate over presidential power, military intervention in domestic politics, and civil liberties during protests.",
