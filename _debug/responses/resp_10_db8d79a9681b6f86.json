The WNBA has seen a 180% average increase in franchise value, with Caitlin Clark’s Indiana Fever growing by 273% to $335 million, highlighting financial expansion. However, the current CBA gives players only 9.3% of revenue, compared to 49% for NBA players, sparking protests from the WNBPA and players like Napheesa Collier, who criticized leadership. The dispute reflects broader issues of equity in professional sports pay and revenue sharing, with the league aiming to finalize a deal by October 31, though not guaranteed.",
