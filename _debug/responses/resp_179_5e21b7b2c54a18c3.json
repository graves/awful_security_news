  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has formally renounced his titles and honours, including the Duke of York title, following sustained public and royal pressure over his past ties to Jeffrey Epstein. While Buckingham Palace has banned him from major royal events like Christmas celebrations and the Order of the Garter, he may return in April 2026 for the Easter church service. Despite the symbolic and public loss of status, Andrew continues to live in Royal Lodge, which has a long lease until 2078, and maintains his family life with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson. His public statements show no remorse, and he continues to assert his sense of duty and honour, which has fueled criticism of his lack of accountability. The scandal remains unresolved, with ongoing public scrutiny intensified by the upcoming publication of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, allegations of Epstein involvement, and questions about the Palace’s prior knowledge. Although the Palace hopes this will end the scandal, the media and political pressure are expected to persist, especially regarding Epstein-related documents and Andrew’s business ties with China.",
