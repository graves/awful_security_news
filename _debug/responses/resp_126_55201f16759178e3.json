His lawyers contest the conviction and the decision to incarcerate him immediately, filing a request for release. Despite widespread public support, including chants from supporters outside his home, Sarkozy maintains he is innocent and accuses political actors of a conspiracy. The case has drawn significant political attention, with President Emmanuel Macron hosting Sarkozy and France’s top magistrate, Rémy Heitz, warning that political interference could undermine judicial independence.",
