  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistan citizen who was indicted in 2023 after marijuana and cocaine were found at his home. The Trump administration defended the law, arguing that habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, especially when impaired. However, lower courts have previously ruled that such prohibitions must have historical roots, and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals specifically rejected targeting habitual users. Hemani and others argue that the historical justification for the law is weak, especially given that nearly half of U.S. states now allow recreational marijuana. The case is also notable for its political dimension, including the prior conviction and pardon of Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, under the same law. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June 2025, and the ruling could have significant implications for gun rights and drug policy across the United States.",
