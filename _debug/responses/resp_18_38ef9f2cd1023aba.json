  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been scrapped, with the U.S. administration confirming no plans for such a meeting in the immediate future. This comes after Trump initially stated a summit could happen within two weeks, but diplomatic efforts, including a phone call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, failed to yield agreement or momentum. The Russian side has rejected proposals to freeze the war, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes Russia’s reduced diplomatic interest to the U.S. withholding long-range missile support. The administration now views Lavrov as a symbolic figure with limited real influence, and believes that high-level meetings between aides are not necessary to advance diplomacy. Future engagement may occur at an ASEAN-led gathering in Malaysia, signaling a shift from direct summit-level diplomacy to lower-level, indirect talks.",
