In July 2024, Penn revised the records and apologized to female athletes, while Thomas lost a legal battle with World Aquatics, which barred her from elite women’s competition. In a rare interview with WHYY, Thomas discussed her personal journey with gender dysphoria, her parents’ initial confusion and eventual support, and the emotional toll of public scrutiny. Despite setbacks, she maintains that swimming brings her peace and that being authentic—despite societal challenges—is worth the courage required. Her experience reflects broader societal tensions about gender identity, fairness in sports, and the importance of self-acceptance. Thomas concludes with a message to young people: 'It’s easier to fight the whole world than to fight yourself,' emphasizing resilience and the value of living authentically.",
