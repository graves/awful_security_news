  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 off-year elections, Democrats across several states—especially Virginia and New Jersey—are re-emphasizing abortion rights as a core campaign issue, despite a broader focus on affordability. Abigail Spanberger, Virginia’s Democratic gubernatorial candidate, directly criticized Republican opponent Winsome Earle-Sears over her past anti-abortion statements, and the campaign has invested heavily in abortion-related messaging. Personal narratives from candidates like Ghazala Hashmi and political ads from Jay Jones are used to humanize the issue and contrast Democratic and Republican positions. Virginia remains one of the few Southern states that has not restricted abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and Democrats plan to push for a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. While voter polls show abortion is not a top priority, trust in Democrats on reproductive rights is significantly higher. Meanwhile, Republican candidates are downplaying abortion, but past actions—including funding cuts to Planned Parenthood and support for judicial decisions limiting access—raise concerns. Advocates warn that without a renewed focus on abortion rights, Democrats risk repeating the political mistakes of 2024, when the issue was sidelined.",
