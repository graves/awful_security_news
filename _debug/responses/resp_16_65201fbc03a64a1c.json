    "A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica.",
    "The storm poses a significant threat of flash flooding and mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Haiti due to heavy rainfall—potentially over one foot in some areas.",
    "Melissa’s track remains uncertain, with two main scenarios: one involving a northward turn toward Hispaniola with potential landfall, and another moving westward toward Central America (Nicaragua or Honduras).",
    "There is a low but non-zero chance Melissa could impact the U.S. mainland, with the most likely effects being rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast; Florida could be affected if the storm remains weaker and takes a more northerly turn.",
    "This storm reflects broader trends of increasing hurricane intensification due to warmer sea surface temperatures linked to climate change, as seen in previous storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto.",
    "The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, 2025, though tropical systems can still form after that date."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm to form in the Caribbean Sea this Atlantic hurricane season, is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm is currently located 300 miles south of Haiti with sustained winds of 50 mph and poses a severe threat of flash flooding and mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Haiti due to potential rainfall exceeding one foot. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the East Coast could face rough surf, and Florida might be affected under certain track scenarios. Melissa’s development highlights broader climate trends of increasing tropical storm intensity due to warmer ocean waters, with recent storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto showing extreme rapid intensification. The storm’s track remains uncertain, with two primary scenarios: one moving north toward Hispaniola, and another moving west toward Central America. The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, 2025, though tropical systems can still form after that date.",
