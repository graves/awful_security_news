  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is launching a legal defense against federal charges of providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His legal team contends that Trump’s personal attacks on Comey and his appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan—after the 120-day limit for interim appointments expired—constitute an unconstitutional circumvention of Senate confirmation requirements. The defense claims Halligan’s appointment was illegal, citing precedent from a dismissed Trump indictment involving special counsel Jack Smith, and argues that the case is a selective, vindictive prosecution targeting someone who criticized the president. The case has drawn significant public and legal attention due to its implications for executive power, constitutional appointments, and protected speech.",
