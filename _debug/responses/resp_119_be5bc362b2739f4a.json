  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, multiple leading institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia—have publicly rejected the agreement. The Compact demands policies such as barring transgender students from using restrooms or playing sports aligned with their gender identity, freezing tuition for five years, limiting international student enrollment, and requiring standardized testing for admissions. MIT and other institutions argue that such policies conflict with core academic values, particularly scientific merit and inclusivity. The White House held a virtual meeting with several universities, including UArizona, UTAustin, Vanderbilt, and UVA, to discuss the Compact, with officials describing the conversation as positive. However, after discussions, Dartmouth and UVA reaffirmed their refusal, citing concerns about academic integrity, fairness, and the politicization of federal funding. The article highlights growing resistance from elite universities to politically driven mandates, especially those linked to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and underscores the tension between federal policy and academic freedom.",
