The Dodgers, fueled by the incredible two-way play of Shohei Ohtani and a strong pitching staff, have won multiple series in the postseason. Despite a shaky regular season and bullpen issues, the Dodgers have been unstoppable in the postseason, while the Blue Jays overcame early deficits and a strong Mariners push to reach the championship.
