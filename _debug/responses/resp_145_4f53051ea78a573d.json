    "A new study estimates that the world will experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 due to climate change, representing nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures.",
    "Prior to the Paris Climate Agreement, the world was on track for 114 extra superhot days per year due to 4°C warming; current commitments reduce this to 57, which is half the worst-case scenario.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days, indicating that climate impacts are already occurring and worsening.",
    "Small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face the largest increases in dangerous heat days — with Panama expected to gain 149 extra superhot days annually — despite contributing only 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "In contrast, top carbon-emitting countries such as the United States, China, and India — responsible for 42% of global CO2 emissions — will face only 23–30 extra superhot days, highlighting a significant disconnect between pollution and heat exposure.",
    "The unequal distribution of climate impacts may exacerbate global inequalities and contribute to geopolitical instability, as noted by climate scientists like Andrew Weaver.",
    "Experts emphasize that the impact will affect tens of thousands or millions of people annually, with thousands already dying in heatwaves each year.",
    "The study underscores the unfairness of climate change impacts, where the most vulnerable nations bear the brunt of extreme weather despite minimal emissions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that, despite progress under the Paris Climate Agreement, the Earth will still experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerous heat. This represents a significant reduction from the pre-2015 worst-case scenario of 114 superhot days, but still indicates a severe and growing climate threat. The study highlights a major climate injustice: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa — which emit only 1% of global greenhouse gases — will face massive spikes in dangerous heat, while top emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts stress that these heat events will impact tens of thousands or millions of people annually, with thousands dying in heatwaves each year. The findings underscore both the ongoing urgency of climate action and the deep global inequities in climate risk exposure.",
