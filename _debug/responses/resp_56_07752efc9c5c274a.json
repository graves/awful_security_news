  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "ICE arrested Radule Bojovic, a police officer from Montenegro, in Hanover Park, Illinois, accusing him of overstaying his tourist visa that expired in 2015, thereby living in the U.S. unlawfully for 10 years. Despite having undergone formal police training and passing background checks, Bojovic was hired based on verified work authorization. DHS officials, including Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, criticized the hiring of an illegal alien with a firearm, calling it a breach of public trust. Hanover Park Mayor Rodney Craig affirmed the hiring process was thorough and compliant with due diligence, but stated that village officials will monitor Bojovic’s immigration status and may return him to duty if legally authorized. The case draws attention to broader immigration enforcement patterns, especially in targeting public officials, as seen in a similar arrest of a school superintendent in Iowa earlier in 2025.",
