  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump has stated he did not want a 'wasted meeting' after plans for a face-to-face summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin were abandoned, due to Russia’s refusal to cease fighting along the current front line. The U.S. and European leaders support a ceasefire at the existing battle line as a first step toward peace, while Russia insists on long-term solutions including the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from eastern regions and recognition of Russian sovereignty over Donbas. A preparatory meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was deemed unnecessary after a 'productive' call, leading to the cancellation of the planned Budapest summit. Trump backed a ceasefire proposal to halt fighting at the current front line, but Russia, through spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Lavrov, maintains its position that such a freeze is only temporary and does not address root causes of the conflict. The potential supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine is said to have prompted Russia’s willingness to talk, suggesting that military escalation may be driving diplomatic engagement. This development underscores the deep ideological and strategic divide between the U.S./European stance on peace and Russia’s maximalist demands.",
