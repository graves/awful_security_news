    "The Guatemalan government under President Bernardo Arévalo has raised the minimum wage and pledged reform, but enforcement remains weak due to power imbalances and factory resistance.",
    "A pattern of subcontracting allows U.S. brands to benefit from low prices without accountability, and when a factory closes, workers often lose access to pensions and severance, with compensation sometimes only provided through humanitarian loans from third-party companies.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article exposes the severe labor abuses in Guatemala’s garment factories—known as maquilas—where tens of thousands of mostly female workers face exploitative conditions, including long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats, despite being employed to supply apparel for major U.S. brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. These factories are largely owned by Korean companies, which dominate investment and operate with minimal accountability. Workers, such as Rutilia Cano and Alexandra, have reported being laid off without pensions or severance, and union leaders face intimidation and violence. The Guatemalan government, under President Bernardo Arévalo, has made promises to improve labor standards, but enforcement remains weak due to factory resistance and political inaction. The article underscores a global pattern of supply chain outsourcing where U.S. brands benefit from low prices without responsibility, and calls attention to the gendered and economic vulnerabilities of women workers in the global garment industry.",
