  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS). The election follows a deepening economic crisis marked by inflation, fuel shortages, and declining natural gas exports, which eroded public trust in the MAS government. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), won 54.5% of the vote and will take office on November 8. While his party holds a plurality in Congress, it lacks a majority, forcing coalition-building. Paz’s platform emphasizes gradual reform, private sector growth, and fiscal decentralization, contrasting with Quiroga’s austerity-driven proposals. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted appeal among youth and working-class voters through anti-corruption messaging. Both candidates pledged stronger U.S. ties, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling the election a transformative opportunity. Paz plans to phase out universal fuel subsidies, targeting vulnerable groups and introducing market rates for industries. However, the incoming government faces challenges, including securing fuel supplies, stabilizing inflation, and avoiding labor protests from the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), which opposes any threat to social gains.",
