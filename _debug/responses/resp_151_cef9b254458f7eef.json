  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A general strike in Gabes, Tunisia, has brought the city to a standstill as tens of thousands of residents protest against the environmental pollution caused by the state-run CGT phosphate plant. Opened in 1972, the plant is blamed for releasing toxic gases, radioactive waste, and phosphogypsum into the air and sea, resulting in over 200 hospitalizations for respiratory illness and widespread health concerns. The protest, led by the powerful UGTT labor union, reflects growing public anger over decades of environmental neglect and a broken 2017 promise to shut down the facility. Despite government claims of urgent measures and the involvement of Chinese companies to manage emissions, the crisis has escalated into one of the most significant political tests for President Kais Saied since he assumed emergency powers in 2021, with activists and citizens demanding accountability and systemic change.",
