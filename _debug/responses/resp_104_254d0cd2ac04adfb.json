  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, has left the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent, citing deep internal dysfunction, disunity, and a lack of strategic response to the political threats of 2024, including public doubts about Biden’s health and the rise of Project 2025. In her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines', she reflects on the 2024 presidential debate, where she first noticed Biden's health concerns, and attributes the party’s electoral loss to disloyalty, public skepticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney, and systemic bias against Black women in leadership roles. Jean-Pierre emphasizes that Black women have been politically loyal and politically active, yet often overlooked, and praises the Biden-Harris administration for including their voices. She frames her shift to independence not as a political defection, but as a call for accountability, political reimagining, and action against silence — arguing that the Democratic Party failed to anticipate and counter the rise of anti-DEI and immigration policies, and that voters must no longer remain passive.",
