  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Christopher Moynihan, a 34-year-old former Capitol rioter pardoned by former President Donald Trump in 2021, has been arrested in New York for making a credible threat to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries during a scheduled speech. Moynihan allegedly planned the attack at the Economic Club of New York, writing in text messages that Jeffries must be eliminated 'for the future' and that he would kill him regardless of public opinion. He was previously sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2023 for breaching police lines during the January 6 Capitol riot, where he was among the first to enter the Senate chamber and took photos from a desk. The case underscores growing concerns about political violence in the U.S., especially following the pardoning of riot defendants. Hakeem Jeffries praised law enforcement for intercepting the threat and condemned the pardon as enabling dangerous individuals to act with impunity. Moynihan remains in custody in Poughkeepsie and has pleaded not guilty to terroristic threat charges.",
