    "Pickleball's popularity has led to a sharp rise in eye injuries, including lacerations, corneal abrasions, and inflamed irises, with an estimated increase of 405 cases per year from 2021 to 2024.",
    "70% of eye injury cases are in adults aged 50 or older, which is unexpected given that sports injuries are typically associated with younger players.",
    "The study attributes the rising injuries to the fast-paced nature of pickleball and the small court size, increasing risks from being hit by the ball, paddle, or falling.",
    "Standardized eye protection guidelines are recommended to reduce up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries, similar to protocols in squash.",
    "Players face challenges in choosing protective eyewear due to a wide price range ($10 to $160) and lack of clear standards.",
    "Recommended protective gear should be made of shatter-resistant polycarbonate and meet the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F3164 standard.",
    "One major reason for non-use of eye protection is lack of awareness about risks.",
    "Experts suggest that posting guidelines at courts, making gear user-friendly, and having professional players wear protective eyewear could promote better safety habits.",
    "The study's limitations include a small sample size and reliance on emergency department data from participating hospitals only."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A study published in JAMA Ophthalmology reveals a significant rise in pickleball-related eye injuries, with 405 additional cases annually from 2021 to 2024. Most injuries occur in adults 50 or older, contrary to expectations that younger players are more at risk. The injuries stem from fast-paced gameplay and physical contact with the ball or paddle. Researchers emphasize the need for standardized eye protection guidelines, recommending shatter-resistant polycarbonate eyewear that meets ASTM F3164 standards. Despite the effectiveness of such gear in reducing injuries by up to 90%, adoption remains low due to lack of awareness, cost, and confusion over product options. Experts suggest solutions like posting guidelines at courts, making gear more user-friendly, and having professional players wear protective eyewear to promote safer play. The study acknowledges limitations, including a small sample size and limited data collection from emergency departments.",
