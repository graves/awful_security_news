  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite not appearing on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a major political force in the 2025 gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Mikie Sherrill are directly engaging with Trump’s policies—such as the cancellation of the Gateway tunnel and the tariff plan—as central campaign issues. Sherrill uses these actions to argue that Trump’s executive decisions are harming New Jersey’s economy, while Ciattarelli leverages Trump’s support to appeal to his base, emphasizing that the race is about local governance, not national politics. In Virginia, the race is less competitive and Trump’s influence is more muted due to the government shutdown and lower political intensity. Democrats are concerned about voter realignment, especially in swing counties like Passaic County, where Trump gained ground in 2024, and are relying on a strategy of ‘voters’ remorse’ to rebuild support. The race is seen as a key early test of how Trump’s base will respond to non-presidential elections, with implications for future midterm races and party control.",
