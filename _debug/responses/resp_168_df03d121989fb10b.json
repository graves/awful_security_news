  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly funding illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating in protected areas of Pará. The report highlights critical gaps in Brazil’s livestock tracking system—specifically, the use of group-level transit permits (GTAs) that fail to track individual animals—allowing deforested cattle to be 'laundered' through the supply chain. Human Rights Watch documents illegal operations in protected areas such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where state agency Adepará has authorized cattle transport, enabling illegal ranching and violence against Indigenous communities. JBS acknowledged in 2025 that it cannot guarantee compliance with environmental laws due to supply chain opacity and has repeatedly failed to meet past commitments, including its 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement. While new policy initiatives in Pará and at the federal level aim to enforce traceability by 2026 and 2032 respectively, experts warn that such timelines are too slow to prevent ongoing environmental and human rights abuses. The report underscores a pressing need for mandatory, publicly accessible, and enforceable traceability systems to hold corporations accountable and halt deforestation linked to global meat consumption.",
