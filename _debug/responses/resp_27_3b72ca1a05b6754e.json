  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Shohei Ohtani delivered a legendary performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three home runs—including a leadoff blast and two in the same game—struck out 10 batters, and pitched six innings in a shutout, becoming the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game and the first to do so in the playoffs. He also became the first player in MLB history to hit three home runs and strike out at least one (10) in the same game. The performance, achieved after pitching in just 13 days, earned him NLCS MVP honors and solidified his place in baseball history. The Dodgers, now the first team to return to the World Series the year after winning it since the Phillies in the late 2000s, will face the American League champion—either the Seattle Mariners or Toronto Blue Jays—in the World Series, where they are expected to face a formidable lineup including Ohtani, Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Tyler Glasnow. The event has been widely celebrated as 'the Shohei Ohtani Game,' with teammates and analysts calling it one of the most extraordinary individual performances in MLB history.",
