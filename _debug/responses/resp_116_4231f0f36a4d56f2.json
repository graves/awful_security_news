  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel in the Caribbean have been repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia for detention and prosecution. The vessel, which was reportedly carrying mostly fentanyl and other illegal narcotics, was targeted as part of a broader campaign of military action against drug trafficking, with at least six such strikes occurring since early September. Trump justified the operation by declaring an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, drawing a legal precedent from the George W. Bush administration's War on Terror. The strike killed at least 29 people, including one additional fatality, and the repatriation avoids legal complications regarding the status of the survivors in U.S. justice systems.",
