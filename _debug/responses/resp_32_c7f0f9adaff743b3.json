The coalition highlights the dangers of misinformation, particularly from former President Donald Trump and changes in CDC vaccine recommendations, such as the withdrawal of support for the MMRV vaccine in children under 4. Despite the CDC and HHS asserting that vaccines remain vital and that trust is being restored, public confidence has dropped significantly, with only half of U.S. adults now trusting CDC information. Local health officials emphasize that vaccination is critical for protecting schools, communities, and families, and stress that public health decisions must be grounded in science, not political ideology. The article underscores the growing need for coordinated, science-based public health action across city and regional boundaries in the face of misinformation and policy instability.",
