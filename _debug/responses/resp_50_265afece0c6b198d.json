    "Sean Grayson, a 31-year-old Illinois sheriff’s deputy, is on trial for the first-degree murder of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman, after a confrontation over a pan of hot water in her Springfield home on July 6, 2024.",

    "Attorneys questioned jurors about their relationships with police, support for law enforcement, and whether they would find it acceptable for officers to use any level of force — none said they would."
