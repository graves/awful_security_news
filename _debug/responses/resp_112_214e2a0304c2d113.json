  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has asserted that most of its announced federal layoffs since October 1, 2025, are not blocked by a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California. While the court halted layoffs at agencies like HUD, the Education Department, and the Census Bureau due to the presence of union bargaining units, the administration argues that agencies such as HHS, which terminated collective bargaining agreements under Executive Order 14251, are not covered by the order. The legal battle centers on whether politically motivated reductions in force violate labor rights and whether the executive order ending collective bargaining applies to those impacted. The plaintiffs have urged the court to expand the scope of the restraining order to include additional unions, and the judge has agreed to do so. Meanwhile, the White House defends the layoffs as legally valid, calling them a consequence of the government shutdown and criticizing the judge as partisan, while OPM data shows that over 300,000 federal workers have left the government since January, with many taking buyouts due to fear of being fired.",
