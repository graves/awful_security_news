  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Diwali, one of India's most widely celebrated festivals, brings together Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains in vibrant celebrations of light, wealth, and family. While traditional firecrackers are a key part of the festivities, they significantly worsen air pollution—especially in northern India. In response, the Indian Supreme Court has lifted a 2020 ban on firecrackers in Delhi, allowing the sale and use of 'green crackers' that claim to reduce pollution by 20–30%. However, critics remain skeptical of their environmental effectiveness. Despite policy efforts, enforcement is often weak, and pollution remains a concern. The festival also emphasizes cultural traditions such as preparing sweets, creating rangoli designs, and worshipping Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. Beyond religion, Diwali fosters interfaith unity and provides a major economic boost through consumer spending across India.",
