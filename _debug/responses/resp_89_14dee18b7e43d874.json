  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S.-China trade relationship has deteriorated after a brief truce, with President Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs of up to 130% on Chinese exports and export controls on critical software. This follows China’s announcement of new restrictions on rare earth minerals — including five new elements — to prevent their use in military or sensitive applications. The move was seen by Trump as a hostile act, especially given his criticism of China’s 'monopoly' in rare earths. In response, China has vowed retaliation, including tariffs on U.S. products, after Washington previously restricted tech exports to Huawei and taxed Chinese ships docked at U.S. ports. A meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea offers a potential diplomatic channel to resolve the crisis, though tensions remain high and the situation could rapidly escalate.",
