  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a national, and Jeison Obando Pérez, a Colombian citizen, after they survived a US military strike on a semi-submersible in the Caribbean alleged to be smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics. The US claims the vessel was a drug-carrying submarine linked to Venezuela's Cartel of the Suns and the Tren de Aragua gang, targeting narco-terrorists. However, Ecuadorean and Colombian authorities have questioned the legality and targeting of the operation, with Ecuador citing no criminal charge against Tufiño and Colombia claiming the strike occurred in its territorial waters. Experts dispute the US narrative, noting that fentanyl primarily enters the US from Mexico, not the southern Caribbean. The US has conducted at least seven strikes since September 2025, resulting in at least 32 deaths. While the US maintains the operations are lawful and necessary to combat drug trafficking, critics argue they breach international law and violate sovereignty, with tensions escalating between the US and several regional governments.",
