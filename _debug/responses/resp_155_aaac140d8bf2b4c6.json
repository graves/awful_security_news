    "Trump threatened sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies on countries supporting the framework, signaling a strong U.S. opposition to international climate action.",
    "Countries such as China, the EU, Brazil, Britain, and Singapore had previously supported the plan, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global carbon-pricing system aimed at reducing shipping emissions, by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the measure. The framework, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions, was already approved in April by 63 IMO members, but the threat of U.S. economic retaliation led to a reversal in voting. Countries like China, the EU, and Singapore supported the plan, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina opposed or shifted support. The delay undermines global efforts to meet climate targets and reflects a broader geopolitical divide between climate action and fossil fuel interests. The decision has drawn criticism from climate advocates, industry leaders, and vulnerable nations like Vanuatu, who stress the urgency of addressing climate change in maritime transport.",
