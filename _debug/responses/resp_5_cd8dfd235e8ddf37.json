  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the enduring cultural impact of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), now celebrated on its 30th anniversary. The film, directed by Aditya Chopra and starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, tells the story of two young Indians from London who fall in love during a European trip and face opposition from Simran's conservative father. Despite its narrative rooted in tradition, the film captured a national moment of cultural awakening during India’s economic liberalization. Its success not only made it the highest-grossing film of 1995 but also launched a new genre in Indian cinema — romantic stories centered on cross-cultural identity, parental approval, and personal sacrifice. The film’s music, fashion design, and narrative structure continue to resonate with audiences, especially across the Indian diaspora. The Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai still screens DDLJ daily, with over 100 tickets sold each day, proving its lasting appeal. While modern critics note dated gender politics — such as Simran’s lack of personal agency — the film remains a romantic blueprint for generations, reflecting both India’s aspirations and the emotional struggles of its youth.",
