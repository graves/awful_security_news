  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil’s Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas in Pará. The investigation highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle raised on illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through animal transit permits (GTAs) that only record group-level data, not individual origins. This lack of traceability means JBS cannot verify that its beef or leather products are not linked to deforestation. The report documents illegal encroachments in Indigenous and protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where violence and land theft have displaced communities. Despite JBS’s 2026 commitment to require supplier declarations and Brazil’s new traceability plans (Pará’s 2026 decree and federal 2032 plan), experts argue the timeline is too slow and enforcement is lacking. The article underscores the urgent need for a federal, publicly accessible, individual-level traceability system to hold companies accountable and halt deforestation in the Amazon.",
