  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Millions of Indians celebrated Diwali in 2025, with a record-breaking lighting of over 2.6 million earthen lamps on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. The event, rooted in the Hindu belief that Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile, involved more than 33,000 volunteers and over 1.6 million lamps produced by local families. Despite the scale of celebration, severe air pollution — with PM2.5 levels reaching 347, 14 times WHO guidelines — raised environmental concerns. In response, India’s Supreme Court allowed limited use of green firecrackers, which emit up to 30% fewer pollutants, during specific hours. This reflects a growing tension between cultural tradition and environmental sustainability in modern India.",
