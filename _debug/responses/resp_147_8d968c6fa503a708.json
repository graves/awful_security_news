  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has faced a series of high-profile thefts, including the 1911 theft of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa by Vincenzo Peruggia and a 1990 theft involving a painting and jewellery. During World War II, the Nazis targeted French cultural assets, prompting director Jacques Jaujard to relocate thousands of artworks, including the Mona Lisa, to protect them. In 1966, jewellery was stolen en route from a U.S. display, and in 1990, a Renoir painting and jewellery were cut and removed. The recent 2025 heist, where eight Napoleonic jewellery pieces were stolen from the Galerie d’Apollon, is distinct because the high intrinsic value of the jewellery allows thieves to break down and resell components, making recovery nearly impossible. Art historian Noah Charney emphasizes that such thefts are harder to trace than painting thefts due to the physical value of the items. While the crown of Empress Eugenie was recovered after being dropped, the other stolen items remain at large. The article underscores the persistent challenges of protecting cultural heritage in the face of evolving criminal tactics and the inherent value of high-intrinsic-value items.",
