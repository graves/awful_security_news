While some local businesses report minimal impact, others face declining bookings and economic strain.

Advocacy groups warn that the absence of park rangers compromises emergency response, visitor safety, and environmental stewardship, urging park closures. The article highlights the complex balance between maintaining public access and preserving safety and sustainability in national parks during periods of federal inaction.",
