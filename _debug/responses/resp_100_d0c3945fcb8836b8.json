    "Israel has banned UNRWA from sending aid to Gaza, citing unsubstantiated allegations that it employs Hamas members, including those involved in the October 7, 2023, attack.",
    "Israel has implemented new rules requiring all international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) to re-register under stringent ideological criteria, including approval by a committee that includes representatives from the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.",
    "The criteria for de-registration include accusations of supporting 'terrorist groups' or 'inciting racism,' which aid groups allege are used broadly to target organizations with which Israel has ideological disagreements.",
    "At least one major U.S.-based NGO and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) are currently de-registered or in the appeal process, with many organizations facing a 60-day deadline to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank.",
    "Only two of seven Israeli border crossings with Gaza are currently open, and requests for aid entry are frequently rejected without explanation, despite Israel's commitment under the ceasefire to allow 600 aid trucks per day.",
    "The U.N. has stated that 600 aid trucks per day are the bare minimum to prevent famine, but only about 10% of trucks entering Gaza are from international aid organizations, with the majority being commercial imports from Israel.",
    "UNRWA, the largest humanitarian provider in Gaza, has warehouses in Egypt and Jordan filled with supplies that could feed the entire population for three months, but access remains blocked.",
    "The U.S. stopped funding UNRWA last year, contributing to a funding gap that other countries have partially filled, but not enough to cover full operations.",
    "Humanitarian organizations argue that the new registration process is not about improving aid delivery but about systematically removing humanitarian actors based on political or ideological grounds."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has introduced sweeping new regulations to de-register major international humanitarian organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological grounds such as support for 'terrorist groups' or 'inciting racism.' These restrictions, enforced by COGAT and approved through a committee including representatives from Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs, have effectively barred organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps from delivering aid. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, Israel continues to restrict access to only two of seven border crossings, with many aid trucks, including hundreds in Egypt and Jordan, stuck in limbo. The Israeli government has also banned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from sending aid, citing unsubstantiated claims that it employs Hamas members, despite no evidence. UNRWA has warehouses filled with supplies that could feed Gaza’s population for three months, but access remains blocked. Humanitarian officials argue that the de-registration process is not about safety or efficiency, but about politically motivated exclusion of organizations that challenge Israel’s narrative.",
