  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global call for improved early-warning systems for extreme weather events, warning that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities. With over 2 million deaths linked to weather, water, and climate hazards in the past 50 years—90% occurring in developing nations—the urgency is clear. Despite progress in early-warning adoption (from 52 to 108 countries), many still have only basic or insufficient systems, especially in fragile and conflict-affected areas. Real-world examples such as the evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, in May 2025 due to a predicted glacier collapse, show the life-saving potential of early warnings. The WMO stresses that early warnings enable early action, and that empowering communities through timely alerts is essential to protecting lives and infrastructure in an era of increasingly extreme weather driven by climate change.",
