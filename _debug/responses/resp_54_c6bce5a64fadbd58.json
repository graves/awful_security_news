  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 robbery of the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery, where thieves used industrial tools to steal Napoleonic crown jewels during daylight hours, marks a worrying shift in museum crime. Unlike traditional heists focused on cultural value, this robbery reflects a new trend targeting artifacts for their raw material value—such as diamonds and gold—capable of being melted down for profit. The heist echoes the 2019 Green Vault robbery in Dresden, suggesting a broader global trend of 'grab-and-go' thefts using powerful tools and exploiting museum accessibility. Experts like Remigiusz Plath and Laura Evans argue that museums, due to their open access and lack of physical barriers, are now vulnerable to such attacks. Evidence such as industrial tools and the damaged Empress Eugénie’s crown underscores the severity. French authorities and Interpol are investigating, with concerns that these crimes may be linked, possibly involving organized crime like the Remmo Clan. The incident raises serious concerns about the security of cultural heritage, with the French public expressing deep national trauma.",
