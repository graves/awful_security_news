  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge, Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies—specifically Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—for allegedly violating her order restricting the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests in Chicago. The judge, an Obama appointee, issued a sweeping order requiring body-worn cameras and specific limits on crowd control tactics, citing concerns that agents deployed tear gas without warning and violated transparency standards. Federal officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified that agents are wearing body cameras and that no tear gas was used without warning, though the judge remains unconvinced and has ordered the deposition of key figures like former ICE interim head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino. The controversy stems from Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led deployment that resulted in over 1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois between September 8 and October 3, triggering protests at the Broadview ICE facility. Protests have continued, with over 100 demonstrators gathering and 15 arrests reported in recent days. The judge insists on full transparency, stating that her order must be followed and that the government must provide verifiable answers to her concerns.",
