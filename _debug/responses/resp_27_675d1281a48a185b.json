  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During an ongoing government shutdown, national parks such as the Grand Canyon, New River Gorge, and Yosemite remain partially open, though with reduced staffing and limited ranger presence. While some local businesses report no immediate decline in tourism, others face financial strain. The absence of park employees has led to increased incidents of illegal activities, including drone use and base jumping, and has contributed to trash buildup in parks. Advocacy groups warn that the long-term impact of the shutdown—such as compromised safety, environmental degradation, and economic losses—could be severe, especially as the shutdown continues into the fall and holiday season. In Washington, D.C., the closure of the Smithsonian museums and National Zoo has driven visitors to private attractions like Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum, resulting in increased foot traffic and revenue for those sites. Meanwhile, state governments, like West Virginia’s, have committed to keeping parks open to protect tourism-driven economies. Despite federal assurances that critical safety functions remain operational, concerns over public safety, visitor behavior, and financial impacts on local communities persist.",
