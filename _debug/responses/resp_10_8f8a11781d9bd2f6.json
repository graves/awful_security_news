  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, resulting in widespread blackouts and civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes these actions to a deliberate strategy of terrorizing civilians through cold and deprivation, and highlights that Russian drones repeatedly circle damaged sites to prolong humanitarian crises. In response, Ukraine is urgently seeking additional military aid from Europe, including air defense systems and long-range missiles, while also advocating for the use of frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—to fund critical defense equipment. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have proposed significant financial support, though the Kremlin claims such asset seizures are illegal. The article also notes a pattern of Russian military escalation following shifts in U.S. diplomatic tone, especially under former President Donald Trump, and raises concerns about a potential peace summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, a close ally of Putin. Despite these challenges, Zelensky remains confident in Ukraine’s position as the only serious party committed to peace and emphasizes that even under pressure, Ukraine is not hopeless.",
