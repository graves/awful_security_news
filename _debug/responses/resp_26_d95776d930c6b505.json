Senate leaders, including Majority Leader John Thune and Senator Rick Scott, have stated they do not support the nomination, with at least one Republican senator indicating a vote against it. The nomination has been met with significant scrutiny due to Ingrassia’s past ties to White nationalist Nick Fuentes and his promotion of conspiracy theories and anti-Israel rhetoric. While Ingrassia’s legal team disputes the authenticity of the texts, claiming they are satirical or manipulated, the controversy has led to a clear political consensus among Republican senators that the nomination will not proceed. The Senate Homeland Security Committee has scheduled a confirmation hearing, but with bipartisan opposition, the nomination is effectively dead.",
