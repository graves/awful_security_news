The FDA and major medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, maintain that acetaminophen is safe and that no clear causal link exists between its use and neurodevelopmental disorders. A study involving over 2 million children found no significant association, and multiple analyses show only a possible correlation, not causation. The Informed Consent Action Network filed a petition to update warnings, but Kenvue argues the changes lack scientific support and would contradict decades of research. Regulatory agencies in the EU, UK, and Canada affirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy, reinforcing the global consensus against alarmist claims.",
