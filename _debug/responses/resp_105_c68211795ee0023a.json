    "She opposes same-sex marriage and separate surnames for married couples, aligning with traditional Japanese values and conservative views.",
    "Takaichi is a protege of Shinzo Abe and is expected to continue his legacy of strengthening Japan’s economy and military posture.",
    "Her government faces criticism over wartime history narratives, such as regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and xenophobic remarks, though she has toned down her rhetoric recently.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan's parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the country's first female prime minister on October 21, 2025, following the resignation of Shigeru Ishiba after a one-year term. Takaichi, a longtime LDP leader and protege of Shinzo Abe, assumed office after a coalition agreement with the rightwing Japan Innovation Party, which replaced the LDP's previous coalition partner, Komeito. Her government lacks a majority and must seek support from opposition parties to pass legislation, raising concerns about stability. Takaichi's policies emphasize economic revival, particularly addressing rising prices, and promote a nationalist, hawkish stance, including military expansion and constitutional revision. She supports imperial male-only succession, opposes same-sex marriage and separate surnames, and has faced criticism for her wartime history views, such as shrine visits. Despite recent efforts to tone down rhetoric, her leadership is viewed as a continuation of Abe's legacy and a shift toward more conservative, right-wing governance in Japan.",
