    "The boundary is being reinforced with fortifications, which may deepen divisions between Netanyahu’s domestic allies and his U.S. counterparts.",
    "Washington, through Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, has urged Netanyahu to 'show restraint' and avoid violations of the ceasefire.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump's peace plan, Israel has withdrawn to a 'yellow line' in Gaza, controlling about 53% of the territory, which Israeli media have labeled as effectively the new border. This move pleases Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies, who see it as a path to expanded settlements. However, it creates tension between domestic political demands and U.S. diplomatic pressure, as Washington urges restraint and compliance with the ceasefire. Israel responded to a Hamas violation with limited air strikes, emphasizing attacks occurred within the yellow line to maintain alignment with U.S. expectations. Netanyahu maintains that war will not end without Hamas's full disarming and Gaza's demilitarization, while commentators note that key military decisions are now being influenced by U.S. policy. The yellow line's permanence remains uncertain, with extremist factions hoping it becomes a de facto border, but most Israelis support ending the war and returning hostages and soldiers home.",
