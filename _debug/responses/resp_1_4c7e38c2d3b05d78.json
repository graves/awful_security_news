  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article by CNN investigates the exploitative labor conditions in Guatemala's maquila garment factories, which supply clothing to major US brands like Target, Ralph Lauren, and Carhartt. Despite contributing nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, the sector operates under severe human rights violations, including wage theft, excessive working hours, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Most workers are women, and they lack formal contracts with US brands, leaving them financially vulnerable and powerless when laid off. Korean-owned companies dominate the supply chain, often bypassing direct accountability. Workers face suppression of union activities, threats, and outright violence, with factory management blocking labor inspections and dismissing union members. Although President Bernardo Arévalo's administration has implemented reforms like a 6% minimum wage increase, enforcement remains weak. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra experience profound financial and psychological trauma, with many unable to secure new employment after long-term service. The article concludes with a warning about the growing instability in global supply chains due to US import tariffs and the gendered nature of exploitation in the garment industry.",
