  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private Hawker 800XP business jet, registered XA-JMR, crashed near Lansing, Michigan, during a post-maintenance test flight, killing all three on board. The aircraft had not flown since March 25, 2024, and was reportedly in a stall recovery attempt when air traffic control lost contact. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation, drawing parallels with a similar crash in February 2024 involving a Hawker jet, raising concerns about recurring safety issues in business jet operations, especially during test flights after prolonged inactivity. The incident involved two pilots and a maintenance representative from Duncan Aviation, who are now listed as victims. Audio and flight tracking data indicate a rapid descent of up to 24,000 feet per minute, suggesting a failure in stall recovery, possibly due to system malfunctions or pilot error under emergency conditions.",
