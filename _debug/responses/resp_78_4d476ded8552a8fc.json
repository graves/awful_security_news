Sliwa, however, has responded by defending his platform and calling out billionaire donors and establishment figures like Bill Ackman and Trump, asserting that he represents blue-collar working-class voters. Trump has mocked Sliwa’s cat-loving persona, adding to the political skepticism. Despite claims of coordination between Sliwa and Mamdani, the latter dismisses such allegations, emphasizing that both candidates are focused on representing the will of ordinary New Yorkers. The article illustrates a broader political struggle between grassroots, community-based candidates and well-funded, establishment figures in a pivotal mayoral election.",
