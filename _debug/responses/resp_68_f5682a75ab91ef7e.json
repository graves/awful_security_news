  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombians are deeply concerned as a diplomatic feud escalates between U.S. President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Trump has threatened to cut U.S. subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombia, accusing Petro of promoting drug production, while Petro responded by calling Trump 'rude and ignorant.' The conflict threatens Colombia's economy, as the U.S. is its largest trading partner—accounting for 30% of exports—making tariffs potentially devastating for key industries like coffee, flowers, and gold. Citizens from various backgrounds, including taxi drivers, housewives, and students, express fear over job losses, visa access, and the lack of real progress in combating drug trafficking. The feud also reflects deeper tensions over leadership, respect, and the unresolved issue of illicit crop cultivation in Colombia, with both leaders failing to address the root causes of the drug crisis, leaving ordinary people to bear the consequences.",
