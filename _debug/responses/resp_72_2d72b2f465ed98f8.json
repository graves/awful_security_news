  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is celebrated by over a billion Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists globally on October 20, 2025, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. The festival spans five days, each with unique traditions: Dhanteras (buying gold and silver), Choti Diwali (Krishna defeats Narakasura), Diwali (worship of Lakshmi and family gatherings), Padwa (husband-wife bond and Govardhan Hill legend), and Bhai Dooj (sibling love). Religious narratives vary by tradition—Hindus celebrate Rama and Sita’s return or Krishna’s victory; Sikhs mark the liberation of Guru Hargobind and 52 kings; Jains honor Lord Mahavira’s enlightenment; and some Buddhists note Emperor Ashoka’s embrace of Buddhism. Though rooted in religious significance, Diwali has evolved into a cultural festival embraced by people of all faiths, featuring home decorations, firecrackers, feasting, and the beginning of the new Hindu financial year. Cultural traditions include gambling games like teen patti, linked to a Shiva-Parvati legend, and economic activities such as opening new business accounts.",
