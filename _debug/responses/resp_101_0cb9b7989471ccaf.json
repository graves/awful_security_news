The White House held a virtual meeting with several institutions to discuss the proposal, but no schools ultimately agreed to sign. These rejections reflect growing resistance to politically driven academic policies and highlight the tension between federal education funding and institutional autonomy, especially in the context of ongoing controversies over diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and research funding cuts.",
