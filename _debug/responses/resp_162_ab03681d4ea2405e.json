  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun serving a five-year jail sentence for criminal conspiracy related to illegal campaign financing from Libya's former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2007. As the first former head of an EU state to be imprisoned, his case represents a historic moment in political accountability. Despite his denial of guilt and claims of innocence, the presiding judge, Nathalie Gavarino, described the offences as of 'exceptional gravity' and ordered imprisonment even with an appeal. Sarkozy is being held in solitary confinement at La Sante prison in Paris, with limited contact and visits. His lawyers have filed a release appeal, which the court will review within two months. The incident has sparked public outcry, with supporters gathering outside his home to protest, and has drawn comparisons to the imprisonment of Nazi collaborator Philippe Petain, underscoring its significance in French political history.",
