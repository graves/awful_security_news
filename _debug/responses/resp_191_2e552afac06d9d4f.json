  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the White House to discuss military support and peace negotiations ended in disappointment, as President Donald Trump shifted focus from confrontational rhetoric to a deal-oriented approach, emphasizing personal grievances and proposing a ceasefire that leaves Ukraine without critical support such as long-range Tomahawk missiles or binding security guarantees. The meeting was seen by Ukrainian officials and citizens as a missed opportunity, with Zelensky carefully navigating diplomatic formality while subtly asserting that Putin remains untrustworthy. Despite U.S. officials framing the conflict as a personal dispute between two leaders, Ukrainians maintain that the war is an act of aggression by Russia and that sustained resistance is necessary to ensure European security. Public sentiment in Kyiv reflects resilience and determination to continue fighting, emphasizing that Ukraine’s survival and sovereignty depend on its own military will, regardless of U.S. policy decisions.",
