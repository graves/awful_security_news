  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, issued a sweeping order restricting federal immigration enforcement tactics in Chicago, requiring all CBP agents to wear body-worn cameras and prohibiting the use of tear gas and less-lethal munitions without warning. The order was challenged by the Trump administration, which defended its actions during Operation Midway Blitz—a large-scale ICE deployment in Chicagoland from September 8 to October 3 that resulted in over 1,000 arrests. Federal officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified that tear gas was not used without warning, though the judge expressed serious concerns about compliance, citing media reports of such use. Initially, ICE interim head Russell Hott was required to testify but left the city; the judge has now ordered his deposition, along with CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino, to ensure full accountability. Protests at the Broadview ICE facility continued, with over 100 demonstrators and multiple arrests, highlighting public resistance to immigration enforcement. Judge Ellis remains adamant that her orders are being followed, stating she is deeply concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability in federal enforcement actions.",
