    "Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, stonemason, writer, and public activist, was found guilty of terrorism charges for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "The attack occurred during a public greeting in Handlova, Slovakia, where Cintula fired five shots at Fico from within a 1-meter distance, wounding him in the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot.",
    "The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica sentenced Cintula to 21 years in prison, citing his intent to target the prime minister specifically as evidence of terrorism.",
    "Cintula claimed he wanted to hurt Fico, not kill him, because he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and cultural freedom, describing the attack as a 'scream against fear paralyzing society'.",
    "Fico, who has been in power since 2006, attributes the attack to rising societal anger caused by opposition to his policies, particularly regarding media freedom and democratic standards.",
    "The opposition accuses Fico of undermining democratic norms, media freedom, and covering up corruption, fueling political polarization.",
    "The court referenced Cintula’s own statements to justify the terrorism designation, noting he targeted a political official rather than a random citizen.",
    "Cintula plans to appeal the verdict, claiming it is unjust, while Fico’s legal team labeled the defendant as a terrorist who set a precedent for violent political confrontation.",
    "Fico has forgiven Cintula despite ongoing health issues from the shooting, highlighting the personal and political tensions surrounding the incident."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for terrorism charges following an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024. The attack, which occurred during a public event in Handlova, left Fico seriously injured and sparked national debate over political polarization, media freedom, and democratic values. The court found Cintula guilty of terrorism because he specifically targeted the prime minister, citing his stated opposition to Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. While Cintula claims he only wanted to harm, not kill, and plans to appeal the verdict, Fico’s legal team labeled him a terrorist who set a precedent for violent political conflict. The case highlights deep societal divisions in Slovakia between the populist government of Fico and the opposition, which accuses him of eroding democratic standards.",
