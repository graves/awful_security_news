    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula shot Fico five times from a distance of less than 1 meter, causing serious injuries including to the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot.",
    "The court ruled that Cintula’s actions constituted terrorism, not just a simple attack on a public official, citing his motive of opposing Fico's policies on Ukraine, media freedom, and culture.",
    "The verdict reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming the opposition for inflaming social anger, while opposition parties accuse Fico of undermining democratic standards and media freedom.",
    "Cintula claimed he aimed to hurt Fico, not kill him, and stated the attack was a 'scream against fear that is paralyzing society.'",
    "Fico, who has remained in public life despite ongoing health issues, has publicly forgiven Cintula.",
    "The sentence was less than the maximum of life in prison, and Cintula has indicated he will appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust'.",
    "The case has become a symbol of political polarization and the dangers of violent extremism in democratic societies."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 in the town of Handlova. The attack, which injured Fico severely, was prosecuted as a terrorism case, with the court citing Cintula’s targeted motivation against Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. Despite Cintula’s claim that he intended only to hurt Fico and not kill him, the court deemed the act a terrorist offense due to the specific targeting of a political leader. The verdict reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming the opposition for inflaming political anger, while opposition parties accuse Fico of undermining democracy. Cintula has expressed outrage at the sentence and plans to appeal, calling it unjust. The case has become a symbol of political polarization and the risks of violent extremism in democratic societies.",
