  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, is investigating whether federal immigration enforcement agents under the Trump administration are complying with her order to restrict the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests. The judge, who previously required body-worn cameras for all agents, expressed serious concerns after reports indicated that agents used tear gas on demonstrators without prior warning. Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation in Chicagoland from September 8 to October 3, 2025, resulted in over 1,000 arrests and intensified protests. Officials including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers testified, asserting compliance with camera mandates and denials of unauthorized tear gas use, but the judge remains unconvinced. She has ordered depositions of Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino to obtain firsthand accounts of events. Protests continue at the Broadview ICE facility, with over 100 demonstrators gathering and 15 arrests reported in recent days, highlighting ongoing tensions between federal immigration enforcement and civil society.",
