  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile—a proven, long-range, precision-guided weapon with combat history in Iraq, Syria, and Iran—as a potential tool for Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory. Despite its destructive capabilities and strategic appeal, Ukraine currently cannot use it due to the lack of a ground-launch system (like the Typhon) and limited U.S. supply. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lobbied for Tomahawk delivery to target key Russian infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov, arguing it would strengthen Ukraine’s position in negotiations. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that the U.S. has few Tomahawks left and needs them for domestic security, limiting supply. Russia has responded with strong warnings, viewing the supply as a hostile act that threatens global security due to the missile’s nuclear capabilities. While Ukraine has pursued its own missile, the Flamingo, its development and production remain uncertain. Ultimately, the article underscores that while Tomahawks offer significant military potential, Ukraine's immediate needs remain focused on air defense against Russian drone and missile attacks, and the broader geopolitical tensions remain high.",
