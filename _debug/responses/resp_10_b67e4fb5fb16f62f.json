  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted in 1989 of murdering their parents in Beverly Hills, have been resentenced by Judge Michael Jesic to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole for the first time. The decision follows extensive testimony from family members and prison staff highlighting the brothers’ remorse, rehabilitation, and participation in prison programs. While the brothers have taken full responsibility for the crimes and cited years of abuse by their father as justification, prosecutors and current District Attorney Nathan Hochman argue that their claims are fabricated and that they pose a moderate risk of violence. The state parole board is scheduled to hold a hearing on June 13, with Governor Gavin Newsom retaining the authority to ultimately grant or deny parole, or to commute their sentences immediately. The brothers are also pursuing a habeas petition to seek a new trial, citing new evidence of abuse by their father. This development raises broader questions about justice, rehabilitation, and the role of parole in capital punishment and high-profile criminal cases.",
