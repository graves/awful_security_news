  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Multiple U.S. universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown, have rejected a White House proposal to join a funding compact that would require them to eliminate considerations of sex and ethnicity in admissions, cap international enrollment, and adopt specific ideological definitions of gender. The offer, sent to nine institutions on October 1, 2025, promises preferential federal funding and research grants in exchange for policy changes. Universities argue that such mandates threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based competition in research. The compact includes provisions like annual anonymous compliance polls and a five-year tuition freeze. While seven schools have formally declined, others — including the University of Texas at Austin, Arizona State, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis — remain undecided or have not responded publicly. The administration claims the compact promotes a more ideologically diverse and competitive higher education system, but universities view it as an overreach that undermines democratic values and scientific innovation.",
