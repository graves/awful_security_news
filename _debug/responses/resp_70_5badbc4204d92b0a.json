    "Seven universities have rejected a White House funding deal that ties expanded federal research funding to ideological reforms such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and enforcing specific gender definitions.",
    "The compact includes demands like mandatory annual anonymous polls on compliance, a 15% cap on international students, a five-year tuition freeze, and a focus on 'grade integrity' and faculty viewpoints.",
    "Universities argue that such agreements undermine academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding, which are essential to innovation and global competitiveness.",
    "The Trump administration's initiative reflects broader efforts to exert ideological control over universities, which are seen as cultural and intellectual centers in American society.",
    "Several schools, including MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, UVA, and Arizona State, have formally declined the proposal, citing concerns about free expression and institutional independence.",
    "The White House claims the compact would provide a competitive advantage in federal grants and partnerships, but universities counter that it could distort research competition and harm academic excellence.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Seven U.S. universities—including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth College, MIT, and Brown University—have rejected a White House proposal that offers expanded federal research funding in exchange for agreeing to ideological reforms. The compact demands changes such as eliminating race and sex from admissions, capping international enrollment, enforcing specific gender definitions, and conducting annual compliance polls. Universities argue that such policies threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based competition, essential for innovation and global leadership in science and education. The Trump administration sees the compact as a way to improve higher education by promoting ideological neutrality, but universities maintain that such control undermines the foundational values of academic inquiry. The White House has not yet secured a majority of signatories, with several institutions either declining or still reviewing the proposal, highlighting ongoing tensions between federal governance and academic independence.",
