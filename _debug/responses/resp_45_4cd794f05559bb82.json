  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is challenging proposed changes to the product’s safety label that would warn pregnant women about a potential link between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD in children. The FDA has not found clear evidence of such a link, and multiple large-scale studies—including one involving over 2 million children—have found no significant associations. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that acetaminophen use during pregnancy increases neurodevelopmental risks, scientific consensus, including from the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists and international health bodies like the EU, UK, and Health Canada, affirms the safety of acetaminophen. Kenvue argues that the proposed changes are unsupported by science, arbitrary, and contrary to long-standing FDA positions. The Informed Consent Action Network filed a citizen’s petition urging stronger warnings, but Kenvue and the FDA maintain that current labeling is accurate and evidence-based.",
