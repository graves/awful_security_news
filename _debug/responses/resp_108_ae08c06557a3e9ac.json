    "Reefline is a seven-mile-long artificial reef project near Miami Beach, designed as both an ecological restoration and an underwater art installation.",
    "The reef will be constructed using marine-grade concrete sculptures, including 22 cast cars arranged in an underwater traffic jam, which serve as coral-growing substrates.",
    "Coral species, such as gorgonians, are grown in a nursery by Colin Foord and will be transplanted onto the reef, with the goal of restoring a historic coral habitat that was lost in the 1970s.",
    "The project is partially funded by a $5 million city bond approved by Miami Beach voters, with an additional $6 million in private fundraising needed for the first phase.",
    "Artistic director Ximena Caminos, originally from Argentina, is leading the project as a cultural placemaker, blending art and ecology to create ecotourism and public environmental value.",
    "Leandro Ehrlich is one of the international artists contributing to the project, believing the corals will eventually overgrow and transform the sculptures into living ecosystems.",
    "The project includes an onshore marine learning center to educate the public about coral reef conservation and aims to create a visually striking, future symbol—such as 57 giant sculpted starfish—visible from the air.",
    "Reefline is described as public housing for fish, using art to provide sustainable homes for marine life and promoting ecotourism and environmental awareness."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a seven-mile-long artificial reef composed of concrete sculptures and planted with resilient corals, aiming to restore a historic coral habitat lost in the 1970s. Led by arts curator Ximena Caminos and coral specialist Colin Foord, the project blends environmental science and artistic design, with sculptures such as 22 cast cars serving as coral substrates. The initiative, funded partially by a city bond and seeking additional private funding, will take at least a decade to complete and includes both underwater ecosystems and an onshore learning center. Over time, corals are expected to overgrow the sculptures, transforming them into living reefs and creating a unique underwater ecotourism destination visible from the air. The project represents a bold fusion of art, ecology, and community engagement to revive a vital marine environment and inspire public awareness about coral reef conservation.",
