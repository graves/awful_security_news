  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is in a prolonged shutdown, now in its fourth week and projected to become one of the longest in history. Key agencies, including the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, are furloughing or facing staffing shortages. Essential programs like Head Start and WIC are at risk of funding cuts, while federal workers are missing paychecks. Republicans, led by senators such as John Barrasso and John Kennedy, are refusing to negotiate on health care subsidies, claiming Democrats are holding the government hostage. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that the economic and health consequences are becoming dire, especially as the next year’s ACA enrollment begins in November. President Donald Trump is hosting a meeting with Republican senators, reinforcing GOP unity and signaling his continued resistance to compromise. Economists warn the shutdown is hurting economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week, and without action, millions of Americans may face skyrocketing health care costs when subsidies expire on December 31, 2025.",
