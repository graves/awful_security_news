  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, and other executives including Evan Spiegel of Snap and Adam Mosseri of Instagram are ordered to testify in a landmark U.S. trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court, which consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts alleging that social media platforms designed addictive features—such as constant 'like' alerts—that harm youth mental health. Despite Meta and Snap arguing that federal law protects them from liability for user content, Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled that companies must face claims of negligence and personal injury due to poor design and lack of safeguards. The companies claim they made efforts to protect young users, like Instagram’s teen accounts with content filtering, but the plaintiffs argue that these were insufficient. The trial, expected in January 2025, represents one of the first major legal actions to hold social media companies accountable for the psychological impacts of their platforms, with TikTok and YouTube also named in the suit. Legal experts and advocacy groups emphasize that CEO testimony is critical to evaluate the companies’ knowledge of risks and failure to act.",
