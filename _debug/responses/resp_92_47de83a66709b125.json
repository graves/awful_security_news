  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in December 2023 after pleading guilty to fraud charges related to fabricated biographical details during his 2022 campaign, was released from prison on October 18, 2025, following a commutation of his seven-year sentence by President Donald Trump. The commutation came after Santos had been serving time at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, and was widely seen as a response to his prolonged solitary confinement and claims of mistreatment. Santos had previously requested a pardon, which he believed was blocked, and continued to plead for 'fairness' and a chance to rebuild. While Republican allies such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Matt Gaetz publicly supported the commutation, it drew criticism from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who argued that Trump should address urgent national issues like healthcare instead of focusing on Santos. The case underscores the tension between executive clemency and accountability in American democracy.",
