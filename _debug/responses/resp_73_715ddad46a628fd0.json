  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Grammy-winning songwriter, Brett James, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, in Franklin, North Carolina, while attempting a visual approach to runway 7. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that the plane, a Cirrus SR22T, entered a 'tightening spiral' due to a failure in communication with air traffic control—specifically, James did not switch to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) despite being instructed. The crash occurred after he announced a 360-degree turn at 6,800 feet, flew over the runway, and descended into a spiral. No mechanical faults were found in the aircraft. James was a highly influential songwriter, known for his work with major artists like Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney, including co-writing 'Out Last Night' and helping launch Carrie Underwood’s career.",
