Trump has accused Petro of being a drug trafficker and threatened to cut US subsidies and raise tariffs, which could severely impact Colombia’s economy—its largest trading partner accounting for 30% of exports. The threat would disrupt key industries such as coffee, oil, flowers, and gold, leading to job losses and business failures. Petro has previously challenged US actions against drug-smuggling boats, leading to a visa revocation and ongoing tensions. Citizens from various backgrounds express fear over economic and personal consequences, including visa access and national dignity. The conflict underscores a failure of both leaders to engage constructively, with ordinary people bearing the brunt of escalating political rhetoric and policy threats.",
