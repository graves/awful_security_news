  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan is facing a major political transition as the Diet prepares to vote for a new prime minister amid uncertainty. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), long the dominant force in Japanese politics, has lost its majority due to a corruption scandal involving over 600 million yen in diverted donations and public dissatisfaction over economic issues. Sanae Takaichi, a former protege of Shinzo Abe and leader of the LDP, is the leading candidate for prime minister, aiming to become Japan’s first female PM through aggressive fiscal expansion and stronger military policies. However, her path is blocked by the collapse of the 26-year LDP-Komeito alliance, which cited unresolved concerns over corporate donations. Takaichi may secure power through a coalition with the Japan Innovation Party, which shares conservative foreign policy views on China, Taiwan, and the imperial family. A key challenger is Yuichiro Tamaki of the Democratic Party for the People (DPFP), who could form a coalition with the center-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Experts warn that Takaichi’s government would lack a majority and would be politically fragile, facing challenges from both internal divisions and external geopolitical pressures, including unpredictable U.S. policy under Donald Trump and sensitive issues like the Yasukuni Shrine. The current political landscape suggests a shift toward greater party compromise and potential no-confidence votes, signaling a new era of multi-party negotiation in Japanese democracy.",
