  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An American Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines (Flight 6469) made an emergency landing in Nebraska after pilots lost contact with flight attendants and heard banging on the cockpit door. The FAA determined that a malfunction in the flight crew mic caused the communication failure, leading to confusion among passengers. Henry Gruver, a passenger traveling to Japan, described the sudden, unexplained banking of the plane and the alarming sound of knocking. Passengers were not informed of the issue until police boarded the aircraft. The flight eventually took off again five hours late, resulting in the family missing their connection to Japan. SkyWest apologized for the inconvenience, attributing the issue to a technical fault in the inter-phone system.",
