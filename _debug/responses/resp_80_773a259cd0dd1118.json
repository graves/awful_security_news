  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 NFL Week 7 Sunday game results were defined by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and high-profile quarterback benchings. The Denver Broncos became the first team since 2007 to overcome a 19-point deficit with a 33-32 win over the New York Giants, powered by second-year QB Bo Nix’s fourth-quarter surge. In another historic performance, New England Patriots' Drake Maye broke Tom Brady’s franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of passes, throw over 200 yards, and rush over 50 yards in a single game. Meanwhile, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets suffered devastating losses — with Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields benched after poor performances — signaling instability in both franchises. The Green Bay Packers also pulled off a late comeback against the Cardinals, fueled by defensive dominance from Micah Parsons. The article underscores the growing unpredictability of NFL outcomes and the increasing role of quarterback performance in shaping team success and roster decisions.",
