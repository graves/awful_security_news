  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure—particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy—aiming to inflict prolonged civilian suffering and disrupt daily life. These attacks, which have occurred on 15 separate days over the past month and include deadly strikes on towns like Novhorod-Siverskyi and Shostka, are part of a deliberate strategy to terrorize the population and undermine resilience. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urgently calling for greater military and economic support from European allies, including a potential €140 billion loan from the EU and the use of frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—to fund vital defense systems like Patriot air defense batteries. The Ukrainian government is also launching retaliatory strikes on Russian infrastructure, while analysts note a pattern of Russian escalation when U.S.-Russian tensions rise, especially after interactions with Donald Trump. Zelensky remains skeptical of any peace negotiations with Putin, particularly in Hungary, and emphasizes that Ukraine is the only serious party committed to peace. The article underscores a growing crisis in both military and diplomatic fronts as Ukraine seeks to survive a sustained, calculated war of attrition.",
