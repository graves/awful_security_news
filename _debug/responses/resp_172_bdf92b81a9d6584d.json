  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that even under current climate commitments, the planet will face an additional 57 superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures — due to climate change. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 superhot days projected under a pre-Paris 4C warming scenario. However, the study highlights a stark global disparity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face the largest increases in heat exposure, despite contributing less than 1% of global emissions, while major emitters like the United States, China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected, with thousands already dying in heatwaves each year. The findings underscore both the continued severity of climate risks and the deep injustice in how climate impacts are distributed globally, potentially fueling geopolitical instability.",
