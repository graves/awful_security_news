  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former Amazon delivery driver, Leah Cross, has filed a lawsuit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that the agency unlawfully abandoned her sex discrimination case—centered on Amazon's failure to provide adequate bathroom breaks for female drivers—following a Trump executive order that deprioritized the use of disparate impact liability in civil rights enforcement. The EEOC, which handles over 88,000 workplace discrimination complaints annually, has since dropped multiple cases, including one involving Sheetz and others related to transgender workers, citing the executive order. Cross, who worked as a driver from August to November 2022, claims that the company’s delivery schedules make it nearly impossible to access restrooms, leading her to use a Shewee device. The lawsuit argues that the EEOC is legally required under the 1991 Civil Rights Act to investigate such claims, and that politically motivated policy changes violate civil rights protections. Amazon has not commented directly on the case but maintains that its technology provides rest breaks and restroom access information. This case reflects a broader concern about the erosion of civil rights enforcement under executive orders that prioritize political ideology over legal protections.",
