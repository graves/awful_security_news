While public messaging emphasizes transparency, security, and American ownership, private communications with election officials in Georgia and Colorado suggest continuity in operations and staff. Many officials expressed concern over lack of prior notice and perceived partisan tone in the announcement, with some viewing the move as a strategic effort to serve conservative jurisdictions. Despite no changes in voting technology or equipment, the sale has raised questions among voters and election deniers about the integrity of the electoral process. Experts warn that the promotional language may deepen skepticism, and public trust remains fragile amid ongoing disinformation and political polarization.",
