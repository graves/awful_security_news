  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A landmark trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court has ordered Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to testify over claims that social media platforms have designed addictive features that harm young people’s mental health. The case, which consolidated hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, alleges that companies failed to implement adequate parental controls and that notifications like 'likes' keep users hooked. Despite a 1990s law shielding platforms from liability for user content, Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled that companies can still be held liable for negligence in app design, especially due to their knowledge of harms and failure to act. The testimony of company executives is deemed essential to evaluate these claims, and the trial—expected in January—is a significant development in holding social media firms accountable for their impact on youth mental health.",
