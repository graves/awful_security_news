The festival draws on multiple religious narratives—such as Rama and Sita’s return, Krishna’s victory, and the liberation of Guru Hargobind and 52 kings during Bandi Chhor Divas. For Sikhs, the event underscores themes of justice and human dignity; for Jains and Buddhists, it commemorates enlightenment and spiritual transformation. Celebrated with diyas, rangolis, fireworks, and feasting, Diwali is both a spiritual and cultural celebration, reflecting shared values of community, renewal, and hope across diverse traditions and regions.",
