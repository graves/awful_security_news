  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political polarization in the United States, over 500 cancer survivors, including individuals from diverse political backgrounds such as Mary Catherine Johnson (a Trump voter) and Lexy Mealing (a Democrat), united to lobby Congress during a citizen advocacy day in Washington, D.C. on September 16, 2025. The event, organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, highlighted the shared personal experience of cancer as a unifying force that transcended partisan politics. Volunteers from New York and across the country visited 484 congressional offices to advocate for increased cancer research funding, expanded access to cancer screening, and continued federal support for health insurance subsidiesâ€”especially for those with chronic illnesses. While some Republican lawmakers opposed subsidies, bipartisan support was evident for research and screening. The day culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, honoring 10,000 individuals affected by cancer. Personal stories and emotional resonance underscored the message that cancer does not care about political affiliation, and that shared human experience can foster empathy and collective action in a divided nation.",
