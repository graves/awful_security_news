  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses how new US tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, and wooden furniture—announced under President Donald Trump’s administration—are increasing construction and renovation costs, placing further pressure on an already struggling housing market. Homebuyers like Anthony Cabrera have seen their budgets balloon due to rising prices, while furniture companies such as RH and IKEA face financial strain and potential price hikes. Economists warn that these tariffs, combined with previous ones on steel and copper, create a compounding effect that could deter affordable housing development and raise consumer costs. Although not a collapse of the housing market, the cumulative impact is seen as damaging, especially for low-cost housing projects. The article highlights both the political rationale (protecting domestic manufacturing and national security) and the economic consequences, showing how trade policy directly affects consumers, builders, and everyday home products.",
