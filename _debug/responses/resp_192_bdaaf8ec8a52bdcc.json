  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen daylight heist on Monday, October 20, 2025, a gang of four thieves broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris using power tools, gaining access via a balcony window in the Gallery of Apollo. They stole eight 19th-century royal jewellery items—diadems, necklaces, earrings, and brooches—once belonging to French royalty, including Empress Eugénie’s crown, which was found damaged during the escape. The thieves were inside for only four minutes, exited on two scooters by 09:38, and were believed to be acting under organized criminal orders. The incident occurred despite the museum’s main alarms sounding, but a localised alarm was reportedly disabled. Authorities suspect the items will be broken up and sold, as they are not easily resold intact. The theft has triggered national outrage, with French leaders calling it an 'attack on our history'. The Louvre remains closed, with visitors receiving refunds. This event follows a recent spate of museum thefts in France and is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities of cultural heritage despite past security reforms.",
