  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has intensified its pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, using a combination of diplomatic isolation, economic sanctions, and military operations to counter what it describes as an illegitimate and drug-trafficking regime. Despite not explicitly calling for a military overthrow, the administration has authorized CIA operations in Venezuela and conducted military strikes on drug vessels, with officials acknowledging that these actions could serve as tools to remove Maduro from power. The policy began with Trump’s 2019 recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader, leading to a diplomatic rupture. Since then, the U.S. has increased its bounty on Maduro from $15 million to $50 million, and now, under the current administration, the threat of direct military intervention appears more active and visible, particularly in the context of ongoing drug trafficking concerns.",
