The election was driven by deepening economic crisis, including soaring inflation, declining gas exports, and fuel shortages, leading widespread voter disillusionment with the MAS government. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, secured 54.5% of the vote over conservative candidate Jorge ‘Tuto’ Quiroga’s 45.5%, though his party lacks a legislative majority, requiring coalition-building for governance. Paz’s platform promotes private sector-led growth, fiscal autonomy, and gradual reform, while preserving social programs. Both candidates pledged to strengthen ties with the United States, with Paz announcing a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal to secure fuel supply. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted his appeal among younger and working-class voters through anti-corruption activism. Despite the shift in power, challenges remain, including securing fuel imports, phasing out subsidies, and managing opposition from the main labor union, the COB. The election marks a significant political turning point for Bolivia, with implications for its economic policy, democratic evolution, and international relations.",
