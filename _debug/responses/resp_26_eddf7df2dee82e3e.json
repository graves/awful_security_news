  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals how garment factories in Guatemala—known as maquilas—serve as a critical, yet opaque, link in the global apparel supply chain, producing clothing for major U.S. brands like Carhartt, Target, and Ralph Lauren. Despite their economic importance—accounting for nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP—the factories operate under brutal conditions: workers, mostly women, face long hours, low wages (less than $500/month), and daily quotas of thousands of garments, often without contracts or legal protection. Korean-owned companies control most investments in the sector, and U.S. brands benefit through subcontracting without direct responsibility for labor abuses. Workers face threats, harassment, and even violence, including the murder of a union leader, and are often powerless to organize or seek justice. The Guatemalan government and labor inspectors struggle to enforce regulations due to factory resistance, and workers suffer severe financial and psychological harm when factories close. Though President Bernardo Arévalo introduced reforms, enforcement remains weak. The article underscores a global pattern of gendered labor exploitation and calls for transparency, accountability, and systemic change in international supply chains.",
