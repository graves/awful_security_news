  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, began at 07:11 GMT in Virginia’s main data center due to a technical error during a DynamoDB API update that disrupted the Domain Name System (DNS), preventing apps from connecting to servers. This cascaded failure affected 113 AWS services, including major apps like Snapchat, WhatsApp, Roblox, Fortnite, Venmo, and financial platforms such as Coinbase and banks. The outage also impacted media organizations including The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, as well as smart home devices like Ring and Alexa. Experts confirmed the incident was caused by human error, not a cyberattack, and AWS restored services by 10:11 GMT, though some users faced message backlogs. The event underscores the critical dependence of modern digital life—ranging from finance to entertainment and smart devices—on centralized cloud infrastructure, raising awareness about the risks of over-reliance on a single provider.",
