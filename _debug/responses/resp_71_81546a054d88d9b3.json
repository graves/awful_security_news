  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A fatal crash on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation on Calçada da Glória. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet safety specifications set by operator CARRIS, and that maintenance records were falsified, with tasks marked as completed without actual execution. Eyewitnesses described the crash as chaotic and terrifying, with one man named Bruno recounting the car appearing out of control. The report notes serious failures in cable integrity, maintenance, and braking systems, and while the findings are preliminary, they raise urgent concerns about safety compliance and oversight in public transport operations in Portugal.",
