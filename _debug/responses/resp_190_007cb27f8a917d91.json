  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New US tariffs on imported home materials—including kitchen cabinets, timber, lumber, and furniture—are driving up construction and renovation costs, creating significant financial pressure on homebuyers, builders, and retailers. These measures, part of a broader trade policy by former President Donald Trump, follow previous levies on steel and copper, which have already raised building material prices. While not a standalone collapse of the housing market, economists warn that the cumulative effect of these tariffs—combined with high mortgage rates and existing market weaknesses—could reduce affordability, especially for low-cost housing. Consumers and businesses are reacting with price increases, delayed projects, and reduced spending, with companies like RH and IKEA facing direct financial consequences. Experts, including Peter Harrell and Matthew Walsh, emphasize that cost uncertainty is the most immediate and damaging impact, with further tariffs expected in January 2025. This situation underscores the broader vulnerability of the US housing market to trade policy shifts.",
