  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A historic theft occurred at the Louvre Museum in Paris on October 20, 2025, when four thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery in a seven-minute heist, stealing nine high-value artifacts, including a sapphire diadem, an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise, and several pieces from Empress Eugénie’s personal collection. Among the stolen items is a reliquary brooch containing the historic Mazarin diamonds, and the pearl diadem crafted for Eugénie. One item, Eugénie’s crown, was recovered near the scene but was damaged. Art recovery expert Arthur Brand described the event as a 'national disaster' due to the immense cultural and historical value of the items, which are central to France’s royal and national identity. Experts believe the thieves will dismantle the jewelry to sell or melt down the gold and silver, raising concerns about permanent loss of irreplaceable heritage. The items were previously owned by noble families, passed through generations, and acquired by the Louvre through historical transactions, highlighting their deep roots in French history and international art trade.",
