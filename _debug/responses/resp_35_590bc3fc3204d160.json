  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a swift summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the White House now stating there are no plans for a meeting in the immediate future. This shift follows a previous announcement after a phone call where Trump suggested a summit within two weeks. The administration and officials now believe that high-level talks between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while productive, are insufficient to move forward due to Lavrov’s limited influence on policy decisions. The Kremlin has maintained that no date was ever set for the summit, so it cannot be postponed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has linked Russia’s reduced diplomatic interest to the U.S. decision not to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, suggesting that such capabilities are key to ending the war. Despite the setback, Trump and U.S. officials remain committed to achieving peace in Ukraine, and discussions about future meetings between Rubio and Lavrov may continue at side events of international gatherings like the ASEAN summit.",
