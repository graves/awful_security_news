  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, specifically focusing on the case of Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistan citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a firearm, marijuana, and cocaine. The prosecution claims Hemani’s habitual marijuana use justifies the ban, while the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that such a prohibition lacks historical precedent and is therefore unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. The Trump administration appealed, arguing that habitual drug users with firearms pose a danger to society, especially during encounters with police. The government also alleges connections between Hemani and Iran, including involvement with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and a celebration of Qasem Soleimani’s life. Hemani’s legal team counters that the law's historical foundation is weak, especially given that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana. The case is notable for its constitutional implications and political sensitivity, including the precedent set by Hunter Biden’s 2024 conviction and subsequent pardon under the same law. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in 2026 and issue a decision by the end of June, potentially reshaping the legal and political landscape of gun ownership and drug use in the United States.",
