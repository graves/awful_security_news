  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Dozens of South Korean nationals were repatriated from Cambodia and arrested for alleged involvement in online scam operations, particularly 'pig-butchering' schemes that exploit Western victims through fraudulent investment schemes. The repatriation followed a joint investigation prompted by concerns over citizen safety, with South Korea also announcing a travel ban to Cambodia. The operation is tied to a broader international crackdown on the Prince Group, a Cambodia-based crime network led by Chinese-Cambodian tycoon Chen Zhi, who advises Cambodian leaders and reportedly generated $30 million daily in scam profits. Chen Zhi is wanted for wire fraud and money laundering and faces up to 40 years in prison. The crackdown comes amid growing reports of severe abuse and torture in scam centres, including the death of a South Korean college student in Kampot Province. This incident highlights the scale and dangers of Cambodia’s cybercrime industry, which has expanded since the pandemic and is now linked to political elites and international financial networks.",
