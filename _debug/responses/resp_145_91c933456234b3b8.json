  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions and a global carbon tax on shipping emissions, citing opposition to what he called a 'Global Green New Scam Tax.' Despite earlier approval of the NZF in April, support from key nations like China, the EU, and the UK was weakened by geopolitical pressure. The framework, which would impose a $380 per metric tonne carbon tax on shipping emissions and reward emissions reductions, aims to cut net emissions by 20% by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. Countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted from support to opposition or delay. The decision has drawn criticism from climate advocates, including Vanuatu’s climate minister and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who view it as a missed opportunity to advance climate action in the shipping sector. The International Chamber of Shipping stressed the need for clarity to enable investment in decarbonization technologies.",
