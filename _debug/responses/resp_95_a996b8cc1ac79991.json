  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears while jogging in the Myoko woods in Japan during early October 2025. The attack left him with a broken arm and leg, requiring multiple surgeries including a hip graft and metal plates. The incident is part of a broader surge in bear attacks across Japan, with over 100 injuries and at least seven deaths reported this year — the highest since 2006. Experts attribute this increase to climate change disrupting bear food sources, forcing bears into urban and forested areas. The Japanese government has responded by announcing tougher measures to control bear populations. Halloran, though physically and psychologically affected, remains determined to return to running and nature, crediting the support of local runners and expressing gratitude for surviving when others have not.",
