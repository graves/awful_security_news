  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after a landmark study showed that introducing peanuts to babies as early as 4 months reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies by over 80%, new research confirms that this public health strategy has made measurable real-world impacts. Since 2015, the rate of peanut allergies in U.S. children under age 3 has declined by over 27%, and by more than 40% after expanded guidelines in 2017. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and based on electronic health records, shows that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since the practice began. The original LEAP trial by Gideon Lack at King’s College London provided the scientific basis for these changes. Despite initial resistance and slow adoption—only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists followed the guidance—public health advocates and experts now see growing evidence that early allergen exposure is effective, safe, and widely beneficial. Recommendations now encourage parents to introduce small amounts of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurt, and tree nut butters between 4 and 6 months of age, without screening, as a proven way to reduce allergy incidence.",
