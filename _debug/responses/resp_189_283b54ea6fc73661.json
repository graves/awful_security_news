  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is experiencing a major boardroom shake-up with seven members—including chairman Helge Lund and vice chairman Henrik Poulsen—departing due to a conflict with its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The foundation, which holds a three-quarter voting interest, pushed for a more extensive reconfiguration than the board proposed, leading to the removal of former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. The company's market value, once at its peak in 2024 as Europe's most-valuable firm, has declined due to competition from rivals like Eli Lilly and growing concerns over profit growth. The boardroom changes come amid broader strategic shifts, including a 9,000-employee layoff, cost-cutting measures, and reduced profit forecasts, as the company adapts to shifting market dynamics and off-label demand for weight-loss drugs.",
