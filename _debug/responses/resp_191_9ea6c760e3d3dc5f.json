  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump’s peace plan, Israel has withdrawn to a 'yellow line' marking control over about 53% of Gaza, forming the first stage of a phased military withdrawal. This temporary boundary, described by one Israeli newspaper as the 'new border,' has become a focal point of political tension, as it aligns with the ambitions of Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners who hope it will become permanent. Meanwhile, US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are pressuring Netanyahu to maintain a ceasefire and show restraint after Hamas violations. Israel’s response—limited airstrikes and emphasizing attacks within the yellow line—demonstrates a careful balancing act to meet both domestic demands and US expectations. Netanyahu maintains that war will only end with Hamas’s full disarmament and demilitarization of Gaza, but the growing influence of US diplomacy and the risk of political fallout suggest that the yellow line may not only be a military boundary but a symbolic and strategic turning point in the broader conflict, with implications for settlement expansion and the future of the Gaza Strip.",
