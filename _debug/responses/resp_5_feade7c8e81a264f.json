  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An American Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines, Flight 6469, made an emergency landing in Nebraska after pilots lost contact with flight attendants and heard knocking on the cockpit door. The flight departed from Omaha’s Eppley Airfield at 6:41 p.m. local time, bound for Los Angeles, but turned around and landed just 18 minutes later. The Federal Aviation Administration determined that a malfunction in the inter-phone system caused the communication failure, and the knocking was likely due to the crew knocking on the door as a result of the system failure. The aircraft, an Embraer ERJ 175 regional jet, was surrounded by firetrucks after landing, though no security incident was reported. The incident highlights critical vulnerabilities in flight crew-attendant communication and raises broader concerns about aviation safety, especially in regional jets.",
