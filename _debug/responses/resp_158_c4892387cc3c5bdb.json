  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major AWS outage that began at 07:11 GMT due to an error in a software update to DynamoDB’s API triggered a cascading failure, affecting 113 services and disrupting critical platforms such as Snapchat, WhatsApp, Roblox, banking apps, airlines, and media outlets. The root cause was a DNS failure that prevented applications from connecting to server addresses. The outage, which lasted until 10:11 GMT, underscored the profound dependence of modern digital life—spanning finance, entertainment, communication, and smart home devices—on cloud infrastructure. Experts attribute the incident to human error rather than cyberattacks, emphasizing that while such outages are common, AWS’s market dominance and rapid recovery processes minimize long-term consequences. The event serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of internet-based services and the risks inherent in centralized cloud computing.",
