Despite Zelensky’s concerns and European officials’ reports of tension, Trump later shifted his position and advocated for a ceasefire along current battle lines, which he said was a realistic and necessary step given the war’s devastation. This reflects a notable shift in Trump’s approach to the conflict, contrasting with earlier claims that Ukraine could reclaim all lost territory. The meeting underscored growing diplomatic friction, especially as Trump emphasized concerns about escalation and winter casualties, while Ukrainian officials maintained the dialogue had clear constructive outcomes. The episode also occurred amid Trump’s broader foreign policy focus on ending conflicts, including his recent truce with Hamas in Gaza.",
