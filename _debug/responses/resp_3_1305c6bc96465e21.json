Republicans argue that the map is a justified response to decades of Democratic gerrymandering, while Democrats accuse them of complying with Trump’s demands and undermining democratic principles. The map now moves to the North Carolina House for approval and may face legal challenges, as state law does not allow Governor Josh Stein to veto it. The outcome of this redistricting could significantly influence the 2026 House elections and shape the political trajectory during the final two years of Donald Trump’s presidency.",
