  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned from Gaza by Hamas, with the other being Israeli citizen Ronen Engel. The return of these bodies, along with 10 others, has reignited tensions under the ceasefire agreement, as Israel demands full compliance and Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains. The process has sparked protests in Israel, with public outrage over delays, and the Rafah crossing remains closed as a point of contention. While the US warns of an imminent Hamas ceasefire violation, Hamas accuses Israel of breaching the agreement through strikes on civilians. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, insists that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed, emphasizing that the return of bodies is non-negotiable. Meanwhile, Gaza’s Civil Defense reports civilian casualties from Israeli military actions, underscoring the ongoing humanitarian crisis despite the ceasefire.",
