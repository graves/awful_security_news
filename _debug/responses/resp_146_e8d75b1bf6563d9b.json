    "The impact of climate change is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa are projected to see the largest increases in superhot days (e.g., Panama with 149 extra days), despite contributing only 1% of global carbon emissions.",
    "In contrast, top carbon emitters like the United States, China, and India—responsible for 42% of global CO₂—will see only 23–30 additional superhot days, highlighting a stark injustice in climate exposure.",
    "Experts warn that this unequal heat burden could exacerbate global inequalities and contribute to geopolitical instability, especially as vulnerable nations face disproportionate climate risks."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that climate change will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100—defined as days warmer than 90% of comparable days between 1991 and 2020—despite the Paris Climate Agreement reducing projected warming from 4°C to 2.6°C. This represents a significant but reduced climate risk compared to the worst-case scenario of 114 superhot days. Since 2015, the world has already seen an average of 11 additional superhot days. The study reveals a stark global inequality: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat exposure—Panama with 149 extra days—while top emitters such as the U.S., China, and India, responsible for 42% of global CO₂, face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that this disparity could deepen global inequalities and spark geopolitical tensions, emphasizing the urgent need for climate justice and equitable adaptation strategies.",
