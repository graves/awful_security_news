    "The 'yellow line' in Gaza represents a temporary military withdrawal by Israel, leaving it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip under Donald Trump's peace plan.",
    "The yellow line is considered by some Israeli media as effectively the new border, which appeals to Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners.",
    "Fortifications along the yellow line aim to demarcate territory but may deepen divisions between Netanyahu’s domestic allies and his U.S. counterparts.",
    "The U.S. government, particularly through Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, urges Netanyahu to show restraint and avoid escalation, especially after Hamas allegedly violated ceasefire terms.",
    "Israel responded to a Hamas attack inside the yellow line with limited air strikes and reaffirmed the truce, signaling compliance with U.S. expectations.",
    "Netanyahu insists on full Hamas disarmament and Gaza demilitarization as conditions for ending the war, while Israeli commentators suggest that actual military decisions are now influenced by U.S. policy.",
    "Hardline settlers and ministers hope the second stage of the deal fails, allowing the yellow line to become a permanent de facto border and enabling new settlements or even annexation of Gaza.",
    "Despite widespread public desire for an end to the war and the return of hostages and soldiers, Netanyahu maintains flexibility, keeping options open through a staged, conditional peace process.",
    "The yellow line reflects a compromise that satisfies U.S. diplomatic goals and provides Netanyahu with political room to maneuver, but risks fracturing alignment between domestic and foreign allies."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The yellow line in Gaza, a temporary Israeli military withdrawal that leaves Israel in control of about 53% of the territory, is a key element of Donald Trump's peace plan. While it has been welcomed by Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners as a strategic gain, it has created tensions between domestic hardline demands and U.S. pressure for restraint. U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have urged Netanyahu to avoid escalation, especially after Hamas allegedly violated ceasefire terms. Israel responded with limited strikes, emphasizing that attacks occurred inside the yellow line to comply with U.S. expectations. Netanyahu maintains that Hamas must be fully disarmed and Gaza demilitarized before the war ends, but Israeli commentators suggest that U.S. influence is increasingly shaping military decisions. The yellow line may become a permanent de facto border if negotiations fail, fueling hopes among extremist settlers for new settlements or annexation. This creates a political dilemma for Netanyahu, who seeks to balance domestic support with U.S. diplomacy in a fragile, multi-stage peace process.",
