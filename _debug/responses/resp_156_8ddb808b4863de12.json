  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has suffered a new heist in which eight Napoleonic-era jewelry pieces were stolen in a four-minute break-in using a truck-mounted ladder and an angle grinder. This marks a shift from previous high-profile thefts, such as the 1911 Mona Lisa heist, which were primarily of paintings. The recent theft is distinct because jewelry has high intrinsic value — it can be broken down, recut, and resold without being linked to its original form — making recovery extremely difficult. The heist occurred at 9:30am on October 21, 2025, during the museum's opening, and the crown of Empress Eugenie was later recovered after being dropped. The article highlights a long history of Louvre thefts, from the 1911 Mona Lisa theft to the 1940 Nazi-era evacuation efforts, and underscores the evolving nature of art theft, now targeting items with high material value rather than cultural symbolism. Experts warn that without a substantial reward for the return of the jewelry in their original form, recovery is unlikely, and the stolen items may be irreversibly lost.",
