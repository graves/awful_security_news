  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the rising threat of drones in Europe, particularly from civilian and non-military sources, and how countries are developing affordable and effective anti-drone systems. While military-grade jamming equipment from companies like MyDefence has seen a shift from defense to civilian use—especially among critical infrastructure operators—the challenge lies in reliably detecting small, hard-to-identify drones. Experts highlight that drones are becoming cheaper and more accessible, forcing defenders to adopt low-cost, scalable solutions. Technologies such as acoustic sensors, advanced radar, and electronic jamming are being developed, with innovations from Sweden's Nordic Air Defence offering affordable, 3D-printed interceptors. Safety concerns in civilian settings, such as drone crashes damaging property, are pushing for safer alternatives like hacking or net-based tangles. A key long-term solution proposed is a drone traffic management system using electronic license plates and flight registration to distinguish legal from illegal drones. Incidents in Poland, Romania, Germany, and Denmark underscore that drone threats are no longer confined to conflict zones but are a widespread, growing security issue across Europe.",
