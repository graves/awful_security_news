  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article outlines the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, centered on China’s expansion of export controls on rare earth minerals in response to US trade restrictions and targeting of Chinese firms. US President Donald Trump responded with a threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, further heightening tensions. The dispute stems from a history of tit-for-tat tariffs, including Trump’s 25% and 145% tariffs in previous years and Biden’s export controls on semiconductors and advanced chips. Both nations have broadened the definition of national security to include economic and technological activities, leading to accusations of mutual weaponization. The situation is set to be resolved or further escalated at an upcoming meeting in South Korea during the APEC summit. Experts note that while the US has greater economic leverage, China is more strategically organized, and the conflict reflects a deeper geopolitical rivalry where economic tools are used for national security and strategic advantage.",
