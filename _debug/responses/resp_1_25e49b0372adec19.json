The story also includes the Roman Passage of Commodus, where Emperor Commodus allegedly survived an assassination attempt, now set to open to the public. Additionally, the London Tunnels, once used as a WWII shelter and by the Special Operations Executive, are undergoing a $149 million renovation to become a premier dark tourism destination by 2028. Other sites—such as the abandoned Turkish ghost town Kayaköy and ancient Babylon in Iraq—illustrate how history, conflict, and decay shape the modern visitor experience. The article underscores how these once-secret or forgotten spaces are now being reinterpreted for public interest, blending history, mystery, and tourism.",
