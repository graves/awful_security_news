  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of deepfake voice scams targeting wealthy Italian businessmen has emerged, with fraudsters using AI to imitate the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and requesting large financial transfers. The scams were amplified by the timing, occurring just after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala. Research from Queen Mary University of London indicates that AI-generated voices are now nearly indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants often rating AI voices as more trustworthy. The scams have led to financial losses exceeding $547 million globally between January and June 2025, and have prompted legal actions from individuals like Massimo Moratti. Governments, including the US and Australia, are responding with new laws banning AI-generated intimate content. While AI voice technology has beneficial applications, such as restoring speech for people with disabilities, its misuse for fraud, identity theft, and the creation of illegal sexual content poses serious societal and ethical threats.",
