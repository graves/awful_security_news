  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Wall Street ended a volatile week on Friday with gains across major indices, driven by improved bank earnings and a shift in U.S.-China trade rhetoric. While concerns persisted over the quality of loans—especially following the bankruptcy of First Brands Group and rising defaults at regional banks like Zions and Western Alliance—investor sentiment improved. Strong quarterly profits from banks such as Truist, Fifth Third, and Huntington helped stabilize the sector. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping alleviated fears of escalating trade tensions. Meanwhile, market indicators like Treasury yields and gold prices reflected a return to stability, although global markets, including Germany’s DAX and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, declined in response to the earlier turmoil. Experts like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and economist Brian Jacobsen highlighted the risk of systemic lending problems, though current data suggests the situation may not be as dire as feared.",
