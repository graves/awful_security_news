  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s unexpected rise in the New York City mayoral race reflects a deep generational shift within the Democratic Party, as younger voters increasingly reject the establishment represented by long-serving figures like Andrew Cuomo. Despite lacking traditional political experience, Mamdani has gained strong support through progressive policy proposals—such as rent control and free bus service—and a dynamic, youth-focused social media campaign. His campaign resonates with young voters, who view him as authentic and forward-thinking, in contrast to Cuomo’s legacy of controversy and perceived elitism. Although Cuomo has criticized Mamdani’s criticism of Israel and his lack of experience, Mamdani has secured key endorsements from Jewish leaders and has built momentum across age demographics, with over half of his support coming from those under 50. If elected, Mamdani would become the first Muslim mayor of New York City, symbolizing a significant cultural and political transformation in a city historically defined by Jewish political power.",
