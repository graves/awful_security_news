  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "London police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, in 2011, asked a bodyguard to investigate Virginia Giuffre’s criminal record to smear her reputation, amid ongoing scrutiny of his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. The investigation follows a major media report and the revelation that Andrew had maintained contact with Epstein after 2010, including a 2011 email stating they were 'in this together.' Giuffre, a victim of Epstein’s trafficking, died by suicide in April 2025, adding emotional weight to the case. Although Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 acknowledging her suffering, he continues to deny wrongdoing. The British government, through Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, condemned the use of a close protection officer in a smear campaign. The House of Windsor has distanced itself from Andrew since 2019, and Giuffre’s family has called on King Charles III to strip him of his title as a form of accountability.",
