  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article outlines the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, centered on a recent threat by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth metals. This follows a long history of tit-for-tat tariff escalations, including previous 100% and 145% tariffs, and a 90-day truce. China justified its rare earth restrictions as a national security measure, claiming U.S. policies unfairly target Chinese firms. The U.S. has long restricted Chinese access to critical technologies, including semiconductors and advanced chips, with measures dating back to 2022 and expanded under the Biden administration. Experts note that both nations are weaponizing economic interdependence, with China adopting a broader national security framework earlier than the U.S. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is under threat due to the escalating conflict, and analysts suggest that neither side is willing to back down, with market responses likely determining the conflict's trajectory.",
