  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona's attorney general, Kris Mayes, has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democratic congresswoman Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution mandates the immediate swearing-in of duly elected members and that Johnson’s delay—based on the precedent of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi—violates constitutional principles and serves as a political maneuver to block a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and strengthen his position in budget negotiations. Johnson claims he will administer the oath when the House returns from recess, dismissing the lawsuit as a publicity stunt. Grijalva, who has not spoken to Johnson since her election, is attempting to schedule a meeting to resolve the conflict. The suit seeks a court order permitting a qualified official to administer the oath if Johnson refuses.",
