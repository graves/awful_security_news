  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans Affairs mental health providers and patients report that long-term one-on-one therapy sessions are being abruptly cut off under a new policy implemented since January 2025 under VA Secretary Doug Collins. Patients like Michael and Jake Pannell describe being emotionally abandoned, with therapy ending prematurely even for chronic conditions such as PTSD. Providers face disciplinary action for extending care, and some have resigned due to frustration. The VA denies there are limits on therapy sessions, asserting a collaborative care model, but critics argue the policy undermines clinical judgment and veteran recovery. Experts, including the American Psychological Association, warn that such rigid limits are inappropriate for many mental health conditions and could re-traumatize patients. The issue raises broader concerns about access, continuity of care, and the quality of mental health services for veterans.",
