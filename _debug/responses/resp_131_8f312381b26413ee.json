  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is indirectly contributing to illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas in Pará. The investigation found that JBS lacks a system to trace the origin of its cattle, allowing illegally deforested animals to be 'laundered' through a system of animal transit permits (GTAs) that only record group data, not individual animals. This opacity enables cattle from illegal ranches—particularly in protected zones like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa—to enter the supply chain undetected. Despite prior commitments, such as the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement, JBS has failed to implement reliable traceability. The situation is exacerbated by weak enforcement, fraudulent land registrations, violence against Indigenous communities, and a lack of public access to GTA data. While Pará's governor and the federal Ministry of Agriculture have introduced traceability mandates by 2026 and 2032 respectively, advocates argue these timelines are too slow and that stronger, mandatory government-led reforms are urgently needed to stop deforestation and ensure corporate accountability.",
