  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election in October 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS) party. The victory comes amid a deepening economic crisis characterized by soaring inflation, declining natural gas exports, and fuel shortages. Paz’s platform emphasizes gradual reform, private sector-led growth, and regional fiscal autonomy, contrasting with Quiroga’s proposed austerity and IMF-backed bailouts. Although Paz’s Christian Democratic Party (PDC) won a plurality in Congress, it lacks a majority, forcing coalition-building. Both candidates pledged to improve diplomatic relations with the United States, with Paz unveiling a $1.5 billion economic deal to secure fuel supplies. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted appeal among younger and working-class voters. However, the incoming government faces significant challenges, including securing fuel, maintaining social programs, and avoiding protests from the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), which warns against threatening economic gains. Analysts view this election as a pivotal turning point in Bolivian democracy.",
