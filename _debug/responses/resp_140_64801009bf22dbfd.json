  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas such as Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through a system of transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual animal records. This makes it impossible to verify the legality of cattle origins, meaning JBS cannot guarantee its products are deforestation-free. The issue is exacerbated by Pará's rising deforestation—up 421% in 2024—and the state’s animal health agency, Adepará, authorizing cattle transport into protected zones. Despite past promises like the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement, JBS has failed to meet its transparency deadlines. Experts and advocacy groups argue that voluntary commitments are insufficient and call for mandatory, government-led traceability systems with public data access. While Brazil has introduced traceability plans by 2026 (state) and 2032 (federal), experts warn these timelines are too slow to stop illegal ranching. The report is especially significant as it is released ahead of COP30, drawing global attention to corporate responsibility in climate and environmental degradation.",
