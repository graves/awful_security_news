  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is reviewing the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, which was made through delegation by the Attorney General without Senate confirmation. The Department of Justice argues that such delegation is a recognized and lawful practice under federal law, citing precedent and administrative continuity. However, legal counsel Abbe Lowell contends that delegating all powers of a U.S. Attorney—such as oversight, personnel, and public roles—is unprecedented and unlawful, asserting that such authority must be granted through Senate confirmation. The case raises broader questions about presidential power, congressional obstruction, and the integrity of federal appointments, with similar challenges now underway in Nevada and California. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, has blamed congressional obstruction for blocking nominations, and the case is being closely watched as it may set a precedent for how future U.S. attorneys are appointed.",
