  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills, marking a significant and ongoing disruption. This follows the previous longest government shutdown in history—lasting 35 days from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019—which cost an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and resulted in approximately 300,000 federal employees being furloughed. The article highlights that while government shutdowns have decreased in frequency since the 1980s, political gridlock, particularly in Congress with narrow majorities and a lack of votes to overcome a Senate filibuster, has made resolving funding disputes increasingly difficult. Speaker Mike Johnson leads a Republican-controlled House with one of the narrowest majorities, contributing to the current stalemate. The situation underscores broader concerns about partisan division and the long-term effects of legislative deadlock on public services and the economy.",
