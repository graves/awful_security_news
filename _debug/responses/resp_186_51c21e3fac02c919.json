Previous state-level bans on firecrackers are frequently flouted, undermining environmental efforts. The article highlights the balance between cultural preservation and environmental sustainability, emphasizing that Diwali's global appeal extends beyond religion to include economic and social dimensions, such as increased consumer spending and inter-community participation.",
