  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary report into a fatal funicular crash in Lisbon on 3 September 2025 reveals a series of critical safety failures, including the use of a defective underground cable that was never certified for passenger transport and had not been tested before installation. The cable, acquired in 2022 by Carris, the operator of Lisbon’s public transport, failed under load, causing the 140-year-old Glória funicular to derail and crash into a building, killing 16 people and injuring 20. The report highlights significant lapses in oversight, maintenance, and testing, with the emergency brake system also failing to function. Carris has dismissed its head of maintenance, and all cable cars in Lisbon are currently out of service pending safety checks. The investigation is ongoing, with the full report expected in 11 months, and key recommendations include implementing a new safety management system in line with European best practice and closing a legal loophole allowing funiculars to be exempt from supervision.",
