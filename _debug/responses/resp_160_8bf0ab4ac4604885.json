  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement allowing the transfer of asylum seekers to Belize, as part of the Trump administration’s strategy to reduce asylum applications and increase deportations. The deal, which emphasizes Belize’s commitment to international law and humanitarian principles, includes safeguards such as nationality restrictions, transfer caps, and national vetoes. However, critics—including Belize’s opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton and human rights experts—argue that Belize lacks the capacity and resources to safely process asylum seekers and could be used as a 'dumping ground'. The agreement is still pending Senate approval and raises broader ethical and legal concerns about the safety of asylum seekers, compliance with international refugee law, and the potential for abuse in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan, and El Salvador’s CECOT prison. This development reflects a wider US trend of using third-party countries to manage immigration, despite legal and humanitarian challenges.",
