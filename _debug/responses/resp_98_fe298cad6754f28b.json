  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two weeks after 23-year-old Kada Scott went missing in Philadelphia, human remains of an unidentified female were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school. Police believe the remains may belong to Scott, and suspect Keon King, a 21-year-old man with prior kidnapping charges, is central to the case. King was identified through phone tracking and is charged with Scott’s kidnapping, as well as a prior domestic incident. A specific anonymous tip led investigators to the grave, and a gold 1999 Toyota Camry linked to King was found after another public tip. The case is part of a larger pattern of behavior under investigation, with authorities examining the nature of Scott and King’s relationship and whether others were involved. The medical examiner is determining the identity of the remains, and the city is supporting the family. The case underscores the importance of public tips and inter-agency cooperation in solving high-profile missing persons cases.",
