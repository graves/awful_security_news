  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the U.S. Marine Corps conducted a live-fire demonstration using a 155mm artillery shell fired from an M777 Howitzer over the I-5 interstate highway. The first shell exploded prematurely at a high altitude, sending fragments that struck and damaged a California Highway Patrol vehicle. The incident sparked controversy, with Governor Gavin Newsom criticizing the safety of the exercise and calling it dangerous, while officials from the White House defended it as an established safe practice. The U.S. has significantly increased production of these shells since 2022—tripling output to 40,000 rounds per month—partly to support Ukraine’s war with Russia. A 2024 Reuters investigation revealed past manufacturing issues, including cracked shells and a shift in explosive composition, raising broader questions about the safety and reliability of the artillery batch used. The shell's premature detonation, which occurred during a routine demonstration attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is considered abnormal and has prompted a review of the shell batch and the decision-making process behind firing over a major highway.",
