  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced poet Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, 2024, classifying the act as a 'terror attack' due to its political motivation. Cintula, from Levice, claimed he was driven by 'moral despair' and sought to protest Fico’s government policies, particularly the suspension of military aid to Ukraine. The incident has intensified political polarization in Slovakia, with Fico accused of authoritarianism, including crackdowns on media and NGOs, and alignment with Russia, while opposing EU policies and Ukraine’s NATO aspirations. A constitutional amendment limiting same-sex rights reflects broader conservative shifts. The case remains politically charged, with Cintula’s lawyer indicating an appeal, and Fico maintaining that the attacker was a 'messenger of political hatred'.",
