  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the remains of two hostages—Ronen Engel and Sonthaya Oakkharasri—killed during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack, marking a step in the ongoing effort to recover deceased victims. Hamas has released 13 remains, with 12 identified as hostages, but one not belonging to a hostage. Israel continues to demand the return of all 28 deceased hostages’ bodies as a condition for reopening the Rafah border crossing, which remains closed since May 2024. Hamas has initiated second-phase ceasefire negotiations, asserting it will not join a postwar governing authority and instead proposes a Community Support Committee to manage daily affairs. The U.S.-mediated ceasefire plan includes disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and establishment of an international administration. Tensions persist, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations, and Hamas rejecting U.S. claims of an imminent attack on Gaza civilians, accusing Israel of providing safe haven to armed groups. The Gaza Health Ministry reports over 68,000 Palestinian deaths, with only 25 of the 150 returned bodies identified; the bodies are largely decomposed and unrecognizable. The conflict remains unresolved, with thousands still missing and humanitarian access severely restricted.",
