  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In response to growing political misinformation and declining public trust in federal public health guidance, the Big Cities Health Coalition — representing public health leaders from major U.S. cities — has issued a strong public statement urging vaccination to prevent outbreaks of measles, polio, and respiratory illnesses. The coalition criticizes the CDC and federal officials, including former President Donald Trump, for making false claims about vaccines and altering childhood immunization schedules in ways that may limit access. A measles outbreak in South Carolina involving over 100 unvaccinated students underscores the urgency of the issue, while declining public trust in the CDC — down to only 50% — highlights a broader crisis in science-based public health messaging. The article emphasizes the need for local governments to collaborate across jurisdictional boundaries and for public health decisions to be grounded in data and science, not political ideology.",
