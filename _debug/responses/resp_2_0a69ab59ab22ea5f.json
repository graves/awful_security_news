  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., has paused job offers to foreign applicants requiring H-1B visas following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a $100,000 fee on these high-skilled work visas. The policy change reflects growing corporate sensitivity to immigration regulations, especially as skilled professionals from India—historically the largest group of H-1B applicants—are most affected. While the Trump administration claims the fee targets abuse of the H-1B program, economists and businesses argue it undermines competitiveness and talent acquisition, with significant implications for innovation and job creation in sectors like tech and e-commerce. This shift illustrates how national immigration policy can directly influence corporate hiring and labor markets, affecting both workers and global business competitiveness.",
