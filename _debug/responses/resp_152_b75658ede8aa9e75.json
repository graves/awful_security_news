  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Bolivians are voting in a presidential run-off election that ends nearly two decades of socialist rule under the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party. The vote pits conservative former interim President Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga against centrist economist Rodrigo Paz, both of whom promise economic reforms to address the nation’s severe crisis—marked by inflation over 20%, fuel shortages, and public financial strain. The election signals a shift toward market-oriented policies and improved relations with the United States, despite challenges like neither candidate winning a congressional majority and the continued influence of former President Evo Morales, who faces legal issues and has called for a boycott. Analysts warn that without meaningful reforms, social unrest may follow. With nearly eight million eligible voters and mandatory participation, the outcome could define Bolivia’s future political and economic trajectory.",
