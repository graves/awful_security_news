  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Multiple prominent U.S. universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, and Dartmouth, have rejected a White House funding proposal that offers preferential federal grants and access to White House events in exchange for significant ideological reforms. These reforms include removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment at 15%, freezing tuition for five years, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes. University leaders argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding—core pillars of higher education. The compact, initially drafted in December 2025 and sent to nine institutions on October 1, includes a deadline of November 21, 2025, for initial signatories. While some schools like the University of Texas at Austin have expressed openness, the overwhelming response from elite institutions reflects deep resistance to federal overreach in academic governance. The White House claims the agreement would promote a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and enhance national educational outcomes, but critics warn it could distort competition and undermine innovation. The controversy underscores a broader political struggle over the role of government in shaping university culture and intellectual independence.",
