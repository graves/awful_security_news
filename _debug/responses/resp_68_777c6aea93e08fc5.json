Among the items taken were a sapphire diadem, an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise, and several pieces associated with Empress Eugénie, including a reliquary brooch and a diamond bow brooch. The theft was described by art expert Arthur Brand as a 'national disaster' due to the profound loss of France’s cultural heritage. One item, Empress Eugénie’s crown, was recovered near the scene but was damaged. Experts warn the thieves may have dismantled the stolen items to sell or melt the gold and silver. The jewelry has deep historical roots, with origins dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries, and some pieces were once owned by royal families or passed through elite families before being acquired by the Louvre. The incident has sparked global concern over the security of cultural treasures and the potential long-term loss of France’s identity through the theft of national symbols.",
