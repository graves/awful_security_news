  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and high-profile quarterback benchings. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the New York Giants 33-32, becoming the first team since 2007 to do so after leading by 18 points or more after three quarters. Second-year quarterback Bo Nix delivered a standout performance, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two scores, culminating in a game-winning field goal. Meanwhile, Drake Maye of the New England Patriots broke Tom Brady’s franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate in a 31-13 win over the Tennessee Titans, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of passes, throw over 200 yards, and rush for over 50 yards in a single game. On the other hand, Tua Tagovailoa of the Miami Dolphins and Justin Fields of the New York Jets were both benched due to poor performances, with Tagovailoa replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers and Fields replaced by Tyrod Taylor. The week highlighted the unpredictability and volatility of the NFL season, with teams rising and falling dramatically in a matter of minutes, showcasing both resilience and fragility in modern football.",
