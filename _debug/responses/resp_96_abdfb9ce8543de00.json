Her attorney, Christopher Parente, disputes this, claiming body camera footage shows a federal agent who swerved into her.

The vehicle involved in the incident was moved approximately 1,000 miles to Maine by federal authorities, sparking controversy over evidence integrity. A federal hearing revealed this move without coordination with Martinez’s attorney, prompting U.S. District Court Judge Georgia Alexakis to order the vehicle’s return to Chicago using a flatbed truck.
