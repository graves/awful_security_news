  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel, including judges appointed by Reagan, Bush, and Obama, is evaluating the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. attorney for New Jersey. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, was appointed through a chain of administrative delegations after her interim term expired, bypassing the usual Senate confirmation process. The DOJ argues that such delegation is a recognized and lawful administrative practice, citing precedent where officials continue functioning without confirmation. However, legal advocates, including Abbe Lowell, contend that full U.S. attorney authority—including oversight, personnel decisions, and public representation—cannot be delegated and that the process constitutes a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The case has broader implications, with similar challenges in Nevada and California, and ties into political disputes involving James Comey and Lindsey Halligan. Habba attributes the appointment to congressional obstruction and asserts that the executive branch must operate independently of political gridlock.",
