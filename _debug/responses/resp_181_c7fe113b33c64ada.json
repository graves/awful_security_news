  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, at least seven people were killed and over 26 injured in a series of Russian drone and missile attacks on Kharkiv and Kyiv, including a strike on a kindergarten that killed two children. The attacks, which occurred just hours after US President Donald Trump canceled a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, signal a shift toward intensified military actions. Ukrainian forces responded by launching a successful strike using UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles against a Russian chemical plant in Bryansk that produces ammunition components. President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes the lack of diplomatic progress to the failure of the US to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles, suggesting that Russia has reduced its interest in negotiations. The Kremlin has rejected ceasefire calls, and the attacks have caused widespread damage, power outages, and civilian casualties, highlighting the ongoing humanitarian toll and deepening geopolitical tensions.",
