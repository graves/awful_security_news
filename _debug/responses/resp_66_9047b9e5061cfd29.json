  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A CNN investigation into Guatemala's garment factories reveals widespread labor exploitation, including wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats of violence, particularly against female workers. Most factories are run by Korean companies that dominate the sector and operate under opaque supply chains, with US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren sourcing products without direct responsibility for working conditions. Workers face extreme physical and emotional tolls, including long hours, lack of pensions, and job instability. Union activity is met with retaliation, including firings, threats, and violence—such as the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal. Despite progressive reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo, enforcement remains weak due to management obstruction and political inertia. The article highlights a critical gap between corporate supply chains and labor rights, exposing how systemic power imbalances and foreign investment perpetuate injustice in the global apparel industry.",
