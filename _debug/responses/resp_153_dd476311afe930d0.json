Hanegbi, who served since 2023, publicly admitted shared responsibility for the failures leading to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation, which the government has not yet established. In response, Netanyahu has appointed Gil Reich, the deputy head of the National Security Council, as acting head, signaling a shift in leadership and strategy. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who argue that the dismissal reflects political evasion of accountability rather than effective governance.",
