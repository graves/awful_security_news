Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possibly homicide. DNA tests confirmed Scott’s identity, and evidence such as cell phone locations and a stolen black Hyundai Accent seen near the scene link King to her disappearance. Authorities believe others may have been involved, and investigations are ongoing. King previously faced charges in another case that were dropped due to lack of witness appearance. Scott’s parents described her as a source of kindness and light, and the case has drawn significant public attention.",
