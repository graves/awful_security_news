  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits his sixth home run of the 2025 postseason, helping the Toronto Blue Jays defeat the Seattle Mariners 6-2 to force a decisive Game 7 in the American League Championship Series. The Mariners' season-high three errors—two in the second inning—proved costly, with fielding lapses by Julio Rodríguez and Eugenio Suárez allowing early runs. Toronto’s lead expanded to 5-0 after Guerrero’s solo shot in the fifth, and a wild pitch from Matt Brash in the seventh sealed the game. The Blue Jays, who have not won a pennant since 1985, are now set to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. Meanwhile, Mariners pitcher Trey Yesavage delivers a strong performance, throwing 31 splitters and limiting damage despite earlier struggles, highlighting a turning point in the series.",
