  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic candidates have outperformed Republican counterparts in all but one of the five most competitive Senate races during the third quarter of 2025, with strong fundraising leads in Georgia, North Carolina, Maine, and Michigan. In Georgia, Jon Ossoff raised $12 million, significantly surpassing Republican challengers and holding over $21 million in reserves. In North Carolina, Roy Cooper raised $10.9 million, outpacing Michael Whatley despite national backing. Maine’s race has been disrupted by the entry of Governor Janet Mills, who raised $1 million in 24 hours, challenging incumbent Susan Collins. In New Hampshire, Chris Pappas outperformed Scott Brown in fundraising, and in Michigan, Democrats led with Haley Stevens raising $1.9 million against Republican Mike Rogers’ $2.2 million. These fundraising advantages suggest Democrats are better positioned to flip Republican-held seats in 2026 midterms, especially in swing states where progressive voters are shifting.",
