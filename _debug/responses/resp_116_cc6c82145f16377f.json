  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political polarization in 2025, over 500 cancer survivors from across the U.S., including individuals from diverse political backgrounds like Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and John Manna, united to lobby Congress in Washington, D.C. Organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the event took place during a federal government shutdown and focused on increasing cancer research funding, expanding cancer screening access, and preserving health insurance subsidies. Personal stories of survival and loss helped volunteers overcome political differences, demonstrating that shared experiences with cancer can foster bipartisan unity. While some Republican lawmakers resisted extending subsidies, most supported increased research and screening. The campaign culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall honoring thousands of individuals affected by cancer, reinforcing the message that 'cancer doesn't care' about political affiliation.",
