    "The Kremlin initiated a nearly two-and-a-half-hour phone call with President Donald Trump to counter escalating U.S. threats to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which could target major Russian cities.",
    "Putin described the call as 'positive and productive' and emphasized that Tomahawks would harm the U.S.-Russia relationship, which he knows Trump values.",
    "Putin praised Trump as a peacemaker in the Middle East, particularly citing his role in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza and releasing Israeli hostages.",
    "A second face-to-face presidential summit was agreed upon in Budapest, Hungary, as a venue for discussing the possibility of ending the war in Ukraine.",
