    "Hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters clashed with police in southwest Dublin on October 21, 2025, after allegations of a sexual assault on a 10-year-old girl at the Citywest Hotel, which houses asylum seekers.",
    "The alleged perpetrator, a 26-year-old man who requested a Romanian interpreter, is believed to be an asylum seeker, though his ethnicity has not been confirmed by police.",
    "The girl reportedly absconded during a city trip and was under state care at the time of the incident.",
    "Protesters launched fireworks, carried signs reading 'Irish lives matter', and chanted 'Get them out!', leading to a police van being set on fire.",
    "Ireland’s Minister for Justice, Jim O’Callaghan, condemned the protests as a 'weaponisation of a crime' and pledged a 'forceful response'.",

    "This incident echoes the November 2023 riots in central Dublin, where a suspect from Algeria triggered far-right violence, including vehicle arson and attacks on police.",
    "Similar anti-immigration unrest occurred in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, in June of the same year, when two Romanian boys were arrested on suspicion of a sexual assault, leading to masked rioters attacking police and setting fires.",
    "Ireland, despite lacking far-right MPs, has witnessed increasing anti-immigration sentiment, especially in response to asylum seeker-related incidents, showing a broader national trend of xenophobia."

These events underscore a rising tide of anti-immigration sentiment in Ireland, despite the absence of far-right political representation, and highlight concerns over public safety, asylum policies, and social cohesion.",
