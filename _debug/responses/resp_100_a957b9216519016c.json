The Compact required schools to ban transgender students from restrooms and sports, freeze tuition, limit international enrollment, and mandate standardized tests, all under the premise of political alignment. While the White House held virtual meetings with several schools, including UVA, Texas at Austin, and Dartmouth, no binding agreement was reached. Institutions cited concerns over academic freedom, merit-based research, and the integrity of higher education, with many stating that political compacts undermine scientific progress and institutional trust. The administration’s broader history of canceling federal research grants over issues like DEI and transgender policies has further fueled resistance, signaling a deep divide between political agendas and academic values.",
