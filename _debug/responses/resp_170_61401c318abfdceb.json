  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the Diwali festival in October 2025, fireworks set off in New Delhi significantly worsened air quality, with the city’s AQI reaching 442 — the highest recorded globally — due to elevated PM2.5 levels over 59 times the WHO’s annual guideline. While India’s Supreme Court allowed limited use of eco-friendly 'green crackers' for three hours on Sunday and Monday, widespread violations led to continued pollution. The Central Pollution Control Board rated the air as 'very poor' at 350. The Ministry of Earth Sciences forecasts that poor air quality will persist through the week. Regional pollution is exacerbated by agricultural fires in Indian Punjab, which contribute to smog affecting neighboring Lahore, Pakistan, where air quality also reached a high of 234. This event underscores the growing regional environmental crisis in South Asia, where seasonal and cultural activities intensify air pollution and impact public health across borders.",
