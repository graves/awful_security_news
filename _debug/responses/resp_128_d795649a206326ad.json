Despite the plan's intent to reduce prices, experts like Kansas State University economist Glynn Tonsor argue that Argentine beef currently accounts for only 2% of U.S. imports and that doubling imports would have minimal impact on grocery prices. Ranchers, including leaders from the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, are concerned that the policy contradicts Trump’s stated goal of boosting domestic production and supports rancher profitability. They also fear the policy introduces uncertainty that could discourage investment in cattle farming. Meanwhile, Argentine producers like Augusto Wallace view increased exports as beneficial, though experts warn that Argentina could face rising domestic prices. The administration, through Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Senator John Hoeven, remains committed to balancing consumer affordability with rancher support, and ranchers are urging Trump to reconsider the plan. Consumers have not shifted to cheaper proteins, with ground beef prices reaching a record $6.32 per pound.",
