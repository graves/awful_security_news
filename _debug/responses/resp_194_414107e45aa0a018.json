  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump and his envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is under intense strain following deadly Israeli strikes across Gaza that killed at least 45 Palestinians, including civilians and children. The violence erupted after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah, which Hamas denies responsibility for due to severed communications. Israel blames Hamas for direct attacks, citing anti-tank missile use and gunfire. The ceasefire, initially seen as a breakthrough, is criticized for vague provisions, particularly regarding Hamas fighters in Israeli-controlled zones beyond the Yellow Line. Israeli officials, including Defence Minister Israel Katz, have issued strict orders for Hamas fighters to leave these areas, while Hamas continues to push for an interim Palestinian-led governance committee. US envoys and Hamas negotiators are now meeting in Cairo to discuss the next phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan, including an international stabilisation force, Hamas disarmament, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The fragile agreement remains at risk, with both sides expressing deep concern over violations, human suffering, and unresolved political and security issues.",
