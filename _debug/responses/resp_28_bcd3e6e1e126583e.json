  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A government shutdown has persisted for 20 days in October 2025, with no resolution in sight due to deep partisan divide over the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies. Republicans are blocking negotiations, citing fraud and waste in the ACA, while Democrats are using the shutdown to demand extension of subsidies to prevent soaring health care costs. President Donald Trump is absent from negotiations and has not engaged with Democrats, despite the escalating impacts—hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed, critical services like air traffic control and nuclear oversight disrupted, and millions facing financial hardship. Republican leaders like John Thune and Mike Johnson are pushing for short-term funding, but Democrats have repeatedly blocked such measures. Internal Republican divisions, including opposition from Senators like Tommy Tuberville, show a lack of consensus on solutions. Meanwhile, public protests against Trump, such as the 'No Kings' demonstrations, indicate growing public discontent. The situation remains politically stale, with neither side showing sufficient willingness to compromise, and the crisis is expected to worsen before Thanksgiving.",
