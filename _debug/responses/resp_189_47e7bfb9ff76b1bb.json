  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a large-scale Marine Corps celebration marking its 250th birthday in southern California, a live artillery demonstration resulted in a 155-millimeter shell detonating prematurely over Interstate 5, sending shrapnel that struck two vehicles in the protective detail of Vice President JD Vance. The California Highway Patrol confirmed no injuries, but the incident raised serious safety concerns, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to close a section of the highway due to extreme life risk. Newsom criticized Vance and the Trump administration for endangering citizens, accusing them of putting lives at risk for political showmanship. Vance defended the event, citing his own Marine Corps service and criticizing government shutdowns and diversity initiatives, particularly those promoted by Democrats like Chuck Schumer. The First Marine Expeditionary Force stated the demonstration had undergone safety checks and was suspended after the incident, though no injuries occurred. Shrapnel was found, including a piece that dented a patrol car, and officials described the sound as like pebbles falling. The event, the largest in a decade, included fighter jets, Navy vessels, helicopters, and live fire, highlighting the tension between military tradition, public safety, and political rhetoric.",
