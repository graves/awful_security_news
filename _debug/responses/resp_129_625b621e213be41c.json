  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale, one of the rarest and most endangered whale species, has shown a positive recovery trend with an estimated population now at 384 individuals, up from 376 in the prior year. This growth follows a 25% population decline from 2010 to 2020 and reflects sustained recovery over the past four years. Scientists credit new conservation efforts, especially in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence, and improved reproductive patterns—such as increased calving rates and shorter breeding intervals—as key to this progress. However, threats like ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement remain significant, and environmental groups warn that weakening existing marine protections could reverse gains. Despite a modest number of calves this year, the entry of new females into the breeding pool offers hope for long-term survival.",
