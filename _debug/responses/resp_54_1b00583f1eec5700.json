  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is actively investigating the federal response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation that led to over 1,000 migrant arrests. In a hearing, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for agents interacting with demonstrators, citing concerns about unannounced use of tear gas and pepper balls. CBP agents are required to wear cameras, but ICE Special Response Teams have not received them due to lack of funding and approval processes. Testimony revealed that ICE agents are trained in crowd control and media handling, yet a pastor, Rev. David Black, reported being struck multiple times without warning while praying outside a detention facility. The federal leadership has been described as unstable, with frequent personnel turnover, including the departure of Russell Hott, who is now being deposed. The Trump administration denies reports of unapproved force use, claiming the judge relies on biased media. Judge Ellis will continue questioning senior officials to assess compliance with her order and transparency in enforcement practices.",
