  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, comprising public health leaders from major U.S. cities across both political lines, has issued a public statement urging increased vaccination to combat rising outbreaks of measles and respiratory illnesses, citing political misinformation from federal officials—including President Donald Trump’s false claims—as a major barrier. The coalition criticizes recent CDC advisory changes that recommend against the MMRV vaccine for children under 4 and calls for science-based, data-driven public health decisions. A measles outbreak in South Carolina affecting over 100 unvaccinated students underscores the urgency of the issue. Declining public trust in the CDC—down to just 50% in a KFF poll—reflects a crisis of confidence in federal public health messaging. Local officials, such as Dr. Phil Huang from Dallas and Dr. Raynard Washington from Mecklenburg County, emphasize the need for collaborative, science-led public health efforts across jurisdictions, especially given the porous nature of U.S. borders and the growing complexity of public health threats.",
