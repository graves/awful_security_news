  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iran has declared that the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — a landmark nuclear deal with world powers — has officially terminated after exactly 10 years. Despite this announcement, the deal is effectively dead due to the UK, Germany, and France triggering the 'snapback' mechanism in August 2024, which re-imposed UN sanctions and ended the agreement's operational life. Iran has since suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following military strikes in June 2024, which killed civilians and damaged nuclear sites. The US, which withdrew from the deal in 2018 under President Donald Trump, remains engaged in diplomatic talks, but Iran insists on guarantees against military action. Experts say the deal is now 'lifeless' and the current diplomatic deadlock reflects deep mistrust between Iran and Western powers, with no prospects for immediate revival.",
