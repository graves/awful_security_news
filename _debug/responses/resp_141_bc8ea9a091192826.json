  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge — such as recognizing unusual animal behavior, heavy rainfall, or distinct sounds — to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite significant government investment in early warning systems (EWS), including the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems are often non-operational, poorly integrated, and lack community trust. Shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain have saved lives through traditional warning signals, such as gunfire or fire, passed down through generations. The lack of trust is attributed to failed equipment, lack of local consultation, and no follow-up by officials. Pakistan, which is among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries, has seen nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022, with rising temperatures and glacier retreat making the region increasingly dangerous. Experts like the UNDP and World Bank highlight systemic global challenges, including weak institutions and communication barriers, which compound the failure of technology-based solutions. As a result, Indigenous knowledge remains a vital, trusted, and effective tool for climate resilience in the absence of reliable technology.",
