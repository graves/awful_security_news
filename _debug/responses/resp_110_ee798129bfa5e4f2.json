    "AI tools are most effective for rapid prototyping and repetitive tasks where accuracy is less critical, but fail in complex, high-level problem solving that requires human creativity and judgment.",
    "Studies show mixed results: a METR study found AI use increased task completion time by 19% among experienced open-source engineers, while a Danish survey reported a modest 6.5% time savings, which experts consider modest.",
    "There is growing concern that AI adoption may lead to job displacement for junior software engineers and foster 'workslop' culture—where AI is used indiscriminately without justification, increasing team workload and reducing collaboration.",
    "Despite company claims, AI use is not universally mandated, and many engineers express low trust in AI outputs, with only about half 'somewhat' trusting AI responses.",
    "The shift in focus of tech incubators like Y Combinator toward AI-only startups highlights a broader industry trend where AI has become a dominant narrative, even as its real-world efficacy remains debated."
