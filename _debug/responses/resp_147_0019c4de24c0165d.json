  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global carbon-pricing system for shipping emissions, by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan. The NZF, which would have imposed a $380 penalty per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions, was originally approved in April 2025. Despite broad international support from countries like China, the EU, Brazil, and Britain, Trump’s political pressure—especially through his Truth Social platform—caused a shift in voting behavior, with countries including Argentina and Singapore opting to delay implementation. The decision marks a setback for global climate goals, with industry leaders and climate-vulnerable nations like Vanuatu criticizing the move as a failure to act on urgent emissions reductions. The IMO, a UN body responsible for maritime safety and pollution control, now faces criticism for failing to advance the shipping sector’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050.",
