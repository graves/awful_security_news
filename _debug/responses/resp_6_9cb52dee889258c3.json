  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions—specifically in the Donbas region—to end the war, despite Ukraine's strong opposition. The meeting, described by European officials as tense and marked by raised voices, reflected a shift in Trump’s approach from earlier claims that Ukraine could reclaim all lost territory to demanding a ceasefire along current battle lines. Trump argued that the conflict had become too destructive and that both sides needed to make compromises, citing the realities of the war and winter conditions. While Zelensky expressed pessimism and concern, he also acknowledged the meeting's potential to advance peace. Ukrainian officials downplayed the tension, calling it constructive and noting mutual agreement on a ceasefire at existing frontlines. Trump denied asking for full surrender of Donbas, stating 78% of Ukraine's land is already under Russian control. The episode follows a recent call between Trump and Putin, during which Putin proposed similar territorial exchanges, suggesting a coordinated diplomatic push. This meeting underscores the growing complexity and volatility in peace negotiations, especially as Trump prioritizes conflict resolution across multiple fronts.",
