  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas in Pará. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: its failure to track indirect suppliers and the lack of individual animal records in Brazil’s GTAs (animal transit permits) system. Cattle raised illegally in protected zones like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa are allegedly moved through a 'laundering' system, concealing their origins before reaching JBS’s facilities. Despite JBS’s 2009 promise to identify all indirect suppliers, it has not fulfilled that commitment. The article emphasizes that without stronger government regulation—such as publicly accessible, individual-level cattle traceability—corporate accountability will remain weak. Pará has seen a dramatic rise in deforestation and land conflicts, with Indigenous communities facing violence and displacement. Experts and advocacy groups call for urgent, enforceable reforms, warning that current timelines for national traceability systems (by 2026 and 2032) are insufficient to halt deforestation.",
