  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating U.S.-China trade conflict, with President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. This action follows a long history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export restrictions, including Trump’s previous 25–145% tariff escalations and Biden’s targeted semiconductor and tech export controls. China justifies its measures as a defense of national security and a reaction to U.S. targeting of Chinese firms in defense and technology sectors. Experts argue that these actions are strategic, with China’s rare earth restrictions serving as 'pre-meeting choreography' to gain leverage ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea. While both sides accuse each other of double standards and unfair practices, the conflict reflects a broader trend of weaponizing economic interdependence and national security in global competition. The situation underscores deepening technological and geopolitical rivalry, with real economic costs affecting both nations, especially China, which relies heavily on exports and global market access.",
