  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration released two survivors from a failed military strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, despite asserting they were 'narco-terrorists' threatening U.S. lives. This decision undermines the administration's claims of a war-like campaign, as it contradicts the idea that these individuals pose an imminent threat and should be detained. The lack of public evidence for the drug trafficking claims, combined with expert skepticism and criticism from international leaders like Colombian President Gustavo Petro, raises serious legal and ethical questions. The administration appears to avoid accountability by releasing the men, sidestepping the need for legal prosecution or detention in U.S. courts. This move has sparked bipartisan concern, with lawmakers such as Senator Todd Young questioning the legality and oversight of the operations. The situation highlights broader issues of due process, congressional oversight, and the use of military force without a declared war or public evidence.",
