  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Tel Aviv soccer derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was canceled due to violent fan unrest and public disorder at Bloomfield Stadium, resulting in injuries to 12 civilians and three police officers, with nine arrests and 16 people detained. Police cited 'endangerment of human life' as the reason for cancellation, after fans reportedly threw pyrotechnics and smoke grenades. Hapoel criticized the police response, accusing them of preparing for a war rather than a sporting event. The incident follows a prior ban on Maccabi fans attending a Europa League game in England due to security concerns, which drew criticism from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who emphasized the need for inclusive and safe fan experiences. The UK government has since reached out to Israeli authorities to understand the Tel Aviv violence, highlighting broader tensions between public safety and fan rights in international sports.",
