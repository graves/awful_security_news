  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to challenge a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a May 9 oversight visit to a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. The incident involved her and other Democratic lawmakers attempting to inspect the facility, during which ICE agents reportedly blocked access and removed Mayor Ras Baraka, who was later arrested for trespassing. McIver’s defense claims her actions were part of legitimate legislative oversight and protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, arguing the prosecution is politically motivated and retaliatory, especially in light of President Donald Trump’s criticism and the lack of charges against other Democratic lawmakers. Prosecutors plan to rely on surveillance and body-worn camera footage to prove physical contact. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government statements suggesting McIver trespassed or that the incident was linked to Antifa activity are prejudicial and ordered the removal of such content from DHS platforms. The case has sparked broader debates about political bias, selective enforcement, and the role of federal agencies during congressional oversight.",
