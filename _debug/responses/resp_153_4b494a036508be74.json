  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), under the UN, has issued a global call to action for improved early-warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of all countries lack sufficient capacity, with devastating consequences—particularly in developing nations where disaster-related deaths are six times higher without such systems. Over 2 million people have died from weather, water, and climate hazards in the past 50 years, mostly in developing countries. While progress has been made, with 108 countries now using early-warning systems (up from 52), half still have only basic or less than basic systems. The article highlights recent disasters in 2025—including floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US—as evidence of the escalating crisis. A key case study is the May 2025 glacier collapse in Switzerland, which prompted the evacuation of the village of Blatten, demonstrating how real-time monitoring enables life-saving actions. The WMO stresses that early warning systems are not just about alerts, but about empowering communities to take preventive action, especially in fragile, conflict-affected, and climate-vulnerable regions.",
