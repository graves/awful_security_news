  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Repair work has begun at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, after a four-week outage caused by severed off-site power lines. The IAEA, led by Director General Rafael Grossi, has facilitated the process by establishing two ceasefire zones — one in Russian-controlled territory for the Dniprovska 750-kV line and another in Ukrainian-controlled territory for the Ferosplavna-1 330-kV backup line — to allow safe restoration of external power. This is critical to prevent a complete blackout, which could lead to fuel melting and radiation release. The Russian-appointed management and Rosatom have confirmed cooperation with the IAEA, while Ukraine's foreign minister accused Russia of deliberately severing the power line. The Russian Defence Ministry is overseeing safety during repairs, and both sides have engaged in diplomatic talks to ensure transparency and safety. This situation highlights the global risk posed by nuclear facilities in active conflict zones.",
