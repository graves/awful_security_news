  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. Cintula shot Fico five times at close range, wounding him seriously. The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica found that the attack constituted terrorism, not just a crime against a public official, based on the deliberate targeting of the prime minister. Cintula claimed he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, seeing the attack as a 'scream against fear.' The verdict highlights deep political and societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming opposition parties for creating social unrest, while the opposition accuses him of undermining democratic norms. Despite the conviction, Cintula has stated he will appeal the decision, calling it 'unjust.' Fico, who has continued in office and publicly expressed forgiveness, remains a central figure in the country’s ongoing political and social discourse.",
