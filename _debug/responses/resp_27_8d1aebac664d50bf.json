    "Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, stonemason, and public activist, was found guilty of terrorism for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public greeting in Handlova, Slovakia.",
    "The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that the attack was not a mere act of murder or assault but a politically motivated terrorism charge, citing Cintula’s stated intent to oppose Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture.",
    "Cintula admitted to shooting Fico five times, wounding him in the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot; Fico has since recovered and returned to public duties, though he continues to face health challenges.",
    "The case exposed deep political divisions in Slovakia between Prime Minister Robert Fico’s populist, pro-nationalist policies and the liberal, pro-EU opposition, which blames Fico for undermining democracy and media freedom.",
    "Cintula claimed the attack was a 'scream against fear' and expressed opposition to Fico’s policies, stating he wanted to stop the prime minister from continuing actions he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture.",
    "The court rejected the defense’s argument that the attack on a public official did not constitute terrorism, emphasizing the targeted nature of the attack against the prime minister.",
    "Cintula has stated he will appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust,' while Fico's legal team described Cintula as a terrorist who sought to set a dangerous precedent of resolving political conflict through violence.",
    "The verdict highlights tensions between political power, democratic norms, and the use of violence in political discourse."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public appearance in Handlova. Cintula, who admitted shooting at Fico five times, claimed he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, describing the act as a 'scream against fear.' The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that the attack constituted terrorism due to its targeted nature and political motivation, rejecting arguments that such an act on a public official is not terrorism. The verdict has intensified political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming the opposition for societal unrest and opposition figures accusing him of undermining democracy. Fico, who has returned to public life despite ongoing health issues, has forgiven Cintula, while Cintula plans to appeal the decision, calling it unjust.",
