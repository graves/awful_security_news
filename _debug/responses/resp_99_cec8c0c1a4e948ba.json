  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective weapon with a long combat history, has been the subject of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s repeated appeals for delivery to enable attacks deep inside Russia. Despite its destructive power and precision, access is limited due to U.S. strategic constraints — President Trump has stated that the U.S. needs Tomahawks for its own defense. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launch system (like the Typhon) to use them effectively, and its own Flamingo missile remains unproven. The Kremlin has raised alarm, fearing that supplying Tomahawks would constitute a hostile act threatening global security. While a few dozen Tomahawks could damage key Russian infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, Ukraine’s primary military need remains robust air defense systems due to escalating Russian drone and missile attacks. Zelensky’s push for a $90 billion arms deal with U.S. manufacturers underscores the strategic importance of long-range strike capabilities in the ongoing war.",
