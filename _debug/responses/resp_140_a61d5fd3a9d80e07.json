    "China tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and seven previously restricted ones (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium).",
    "The restrictions apply to both raw rare-earth metals and specialized equipment used to refine them, requiring foreign companies to obtain special Beijing approvals for exports involving products with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",
    "China cites national security concerns, citing evidence of foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications, which it claims threatens its security and global stability.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for U.S. defence systems (e.g., F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, radar) and civilian technologies (e.g., electric vehicles, AI, smartphones, medical imaging), making the controls strategically significant.",
    "China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals (60% mined, 90% processed), giving it substantial supply chain leverage over global markets.",
    "The U.S. was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products in 2023 (importing $22.8 million), with 70% of its rare-earth imports from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "The move is interpreted as a 'signalling' tactic ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting at APEC, demonstrating China’s willingness to weaponize its supply dominance in negotiations.",
    "The restrictions may deepen U.S. vulnerabilities in defence and technology supply chains, especially as the U.S. struggles to expand its domestic production capabilities.",
    "China has stated that emergency medical needs, disaster relief, or public health emergencies will be exempt from these controls.",
    "Analysts from CSIS and the University of Montana suggest that while China's actions are strategically damaging to U.S. interests, they also carry economic risks by disrupting interdependent supply chains."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—adding five new ones (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) to earlier restrictions—effective December 1, 2025. The measures, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, require foreign companies to obtain special approvals for exports involving rare-earth products with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth content, citing national security concerns over foreign entities using these materials for military applications. Given China’s dominance in rare-earth production (60% mined, 90% processed), the move significantly impacts the U.S., which imported $22.8 million worth of Chinese rare-earth products in 2023 and relies on 70% of its rare-earth supply from China. These controls are seen as a strategic signal ahead of a high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, reinforcing China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations and deepening U.S. vulnerabilities in defence and civilian technologies such as electric vehicles, AI, and fighter jets. The U.S. defence industry, including systems like the F-35, submarines, and missiles, is especially at risk. While emergency medical and disaster relief cases are exempt, analysts interpret the move as a calculated tactic to strengthen China’s diplomatic position and highlight the interdependence of global supply chains.",
