The video, posted on Truth Social, was made using music from the 1986 film 'Top Gun,' which features Loggins’ song. Loggins asserts he was not asked for permission and calls for the video to be removed, emphasizing the need for unity amid political polarization. This incident follows a history of similar music controversies, including objections from artists like Adele and Bruce Springsteen to Trump’s use of their music in political settings. Trump has previously used AI-generated videos with music, such as Blue Oyster Cult’s 'Don’t Fear the Reaper,' to comment on political figures, highlighting a broader trend of political satire using copyrighted material. The White House responded with a 'Top Gun' still, further illustrating the intersection of music, technology, and political discourse.",
