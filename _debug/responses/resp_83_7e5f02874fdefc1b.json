  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In response to growing misinformation and declining vaccination rates, the Big Cities Health Coalition — a group of public health leaders from major U.S. cities — has issued a strong public statement urging vaccination. They criticize federal officials, including former President Donald Trump and CDC advisory panels, for making false claims and altering vaccine schedules in ways that limit access. With a measles outbreak affecting over 100 unvaccinated students in South Carolina and declining public trust in the CDC — down to just 50% among U.S. adults — city health officials emphasize science-based, data-driven messaging to protect communities. They stress the importance of collaboration across jurisdictions, as public health is not confined by administrative boundaries. This public stand reflects a broader crisis of trust in federal public health institutions and underscores the need for consistent, transparent, and evidence-based guidance.",
