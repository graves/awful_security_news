  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China’s Communist Party is holding its fourth plenum, a key political gathering led by Xi Jinping, to chart the country’s economic future through 2030. Amid rising US trade and tech tensions, and a domestic slowdown—marked by a 4.8% GDP growth in Q3—the plenum focuses on strengthening economic security and technological innovation in AI, quantum computing, and green energy. This comes after a sweeping anti-corruption purge that ousted top military officials, including He Weidong, the highest-ranking casualty to date. The meeting may include major personnel reshuffles, signaling a consolidation of power under Xi, who has maintained control through unprecedented longevity in office and a tightly managed political system. Despite economic challenges like overcapacity, deflation, and weak consumer demand, analysts expect minimal deviation from Xi’s current strategy, with only targeted adjustments such as addressing domestic competition and stimulating consumption.",
