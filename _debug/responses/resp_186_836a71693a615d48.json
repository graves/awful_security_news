  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced the end of US aid and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' who encourages widespread drug production. This comes after Petro accused the US of committing 'murder' when US forces attacked a fishing boat in Colombian waters in September 2025, killing fisherman Alejandro Carranza, who was reportedly fishing and not involved in drug trafficking. The US claims the vessel carried fentanyl and other narcotics, though no evidence has been provided. UN human rights experts have criticized the strikes as extrajudicial executions. The move follows a US declaration in September that Colombia had failed drug trafficking commitments, though a temporary waiver allowed aid to continue. The broader context includes a surge in US military operations in the Caribbean Sea, including six strikes in recent weeks, killing at least 27 people. These actions have intensified diplomatic tensions with Latin America, especially as Trump also authorized CIA covert operations in Venezuela and accused President Nicolás Maduro of making Venezuela an American colony.",
