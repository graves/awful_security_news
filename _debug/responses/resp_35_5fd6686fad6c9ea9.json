  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance downplayed concerns over the Israel-Hamas ceasefire during a visit to Israel, expressing optimism about its durability while refusing to set a timeline for the return of hostages or Hamas’ disarmament. This visit comes amid growing internal US concern that the ceasefire may collapse after Hamas allegedly attacked Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed dozens in Gaza. US officials, including Trump administration figures, are worried about the deal’s fragility, especially in the short term, and see Vance’s presence as a show of force to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed. Trump himself questioned whether Hamas leaders orchestrated the attack, suggesting instead a 'rebellion' within the group, and threatened to 'eradicate' Hamas if necessary. Israeli officials are pushing for US-led demilitarization of Hamas before reconstruction talks begin. The next 30 days are seen as critical for the ceasefire to hold and for the peace process to advance toward the next phase of the 20-point peace plan.",
