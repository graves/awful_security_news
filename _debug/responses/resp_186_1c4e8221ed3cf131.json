  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the significance of Israel's 'yellow line' in Gaza, which marks the first stage of a three-phase military withdrawal under Donald Trump's peace plan, leaving Israel in control of about 53% of the strip. The line is seen by some as a potential de facto border, especially if negotiations fail, and is politically significant as it satisfies far-right coalition partners who hope for settlement expansion. While US officials like JD Vance, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner are urging Netanyahu to maintain restraint and avoid breaking the ceasefire, Netanyahu maintains that war will continue until Hamas is fully disarmed. The second stage of the peace plan, which involves Hamas disarmament and power transfer, remains uncertain, creating tension between domestic hardline demands and US diplomatic pressure. Israeli commentators suggest that military decisions are increasingly influenced by Washington, and Netanyahu's strategy of staged agreements allows him to preserve political flexibility amid conflicting expectations.",
