The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed a malfunction in the inter-phone system as the root cause, with no security incident or injuries reported. The aircraft, an Embraer ERJ 175 regional jet, was later observed parked away from the terminal with two firetrucks present, indicating precautionary measures. The incident underscores potential risks in aircraft communication systems and highlights the importance of real-time crew coordination in commercial aviation.",
