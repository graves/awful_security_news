  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump’s response to the 'No Kings' protests—by posting AI-generated memes mocking him as a king—demonstrates a growing belief in unchecked presidential power. The protests, which drew millions of Americans across 50 states, reflect widespread public concern that Trump’s actions are eroding democratic norms. His recent pardon of George Santos, demands for criminal charges against political rivals, and military actions abroad without congressional approval further signal a shift toward authoritarianism. Critics, including Senators, legal experts, and civil rights leaders, argue that such actions violate constitutional principles and undermine the rule of law. Meanwhile, Trump dismisses the protests as 'jokes' and expresses contempt for dissent, while protesters emphasize their commitment to democratic values and peaceful resistance. The article concludes that Trump’s behavior is not only provocative but substantively proving the protesters’ core claim: that the U.S. is at risk of a return to autocratic governance.",
