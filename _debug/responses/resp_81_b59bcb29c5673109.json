  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two voter turnout organizations founded by Stacey Abrams — the New Georgia Project and its affiliated Action Fund — have announced their closure, raising concerns about the sustainability of Democratic voter organizing in Georgia. Established in 2013 to register and mobilize nonwhite and young voters, the groups achieved notable success in 2018 and 2020, helping Democrats win key races including the U.S. Senate. However, they faced significant challenges, including a record $300,000 fine from the Georgia Ethics Commission in 2025 for illegal campaign activities, leadership disputes, declining donations, and staff layoffs. Despite early successes, the organizations failed to maintain momentum, with Democratic voter turnout and political gains in 2024 being outweighed by stronger Republican turnout. The closure coincides with key Democratic ambitions, such as Senator Jon Ossoff’s 2026 reelection bid and the first Democratic gubernatorial campaign since 1998, signaling a pivotal moment in the long-term viability of progressive voter mobilization in the Deep South.",
