  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Doubts are emerging over a potential swift Trump-Putin summit in Budapest to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine, as Moscow downplays any imminent timeline and emphasizes that preparations require time. Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, state that there is no agreement on dates or conditions, and that Russia’s hardline demands—such as territorial concessions and Ukraine's neutrality—remain unchanged since the Alaska summit. A planned preparatory meeting between Lavrov and U.S. counterpart Marco Rubio has been postponed, revealing possible disagreements over ceasefire terms. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders accuse Russia of stalling and continuing attacks, insisting that only Ukraine is committed to peace. While Trump proposes freezing battle lines as a starting point, Putin has rejected such proposals, maintaining a position rooted in maximalist demands. The delay raises concerns about the viability of a quick resolution to the conflict.",
