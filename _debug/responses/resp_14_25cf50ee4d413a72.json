    "A daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris resulted in the theft of high-value royal jewelry, estimated at 88 million euros ($102 million).",
    "The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery via a window and took items such as a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, including a diadem with 24 Ceylon sapphires and over 1,000 diamonds, and an emerald necklace and earrings from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise.",
    "The heist took just four minutes, with the robbers leaving on two scooters along the Seine and using tools like an angle grinder and blowtorch.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris saw thieves using a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery, stealing high-value royal jewelry including a diadem and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise. The heist, which took only four minutes, was carried out by two armed men wearing yellow vests who left on scooters by the Seine. The stolen items are estimated to be worth $102 million, and eight of the nine items remain missing. Experts believe the jewelry may have been dismantled or sold on the black market for money laundering, making recovery unlikely. French officials, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have acknowledged serious security failures. The incident is being linked to organized crime and is compared to historical thefts like the 1911 Mona Lisa robbery and the 1998 Camille Corot theft. Investigators have recovered a scooter and a helmet and are analyzing the truck used in the heist, though progress is slow. The broader implications include a loss of cultural heritage and a significant blow to national pride in France.",
