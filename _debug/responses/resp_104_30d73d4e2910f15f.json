    "The term 'enshittification' was coined by Cory Doctorow and has become widely recognized in internet culture and policy debates.",
    "Doctorow identifies a three-stage process through which internet platforms degrade: user acquisition, business prioritization, and profit extraction.",
    "Stage 1: Platforms attract users with free or low-cost offers and strong network effects, such as Facebook’s early non-invasive feed or Amazon’s deals.",
    "Stage 2: Platforms shift focus to business customers, using user data to target ads and subsidizing business operations (e.g., Amazon paying full price for goods to sell below cost).",
    "Stage 3: Platforms begin extracting revenue through junk fees, algorithm manipulation, and poor search results (e.g., Amazon charging 45–51 cents per dollar earned by sellers; Facebook boosting content without user consent).",
    "Amazon and Facebook deny Doctorow’s claims, asserting their services have improved and that fees are not predatory or junk fees.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to lack of competition and weak consumer regulations, especially the consumer welfare standard.",
    "Proposed solutions include stronger antitrust enforcement, the 'right-to-exit' policy (e.g., allowing Kindle users to take books with them), and improved interoperability (e.g., allowing third-party apps and services to work across platforms).",
    "The theory is gaining traction globally, with growing public and political support for reversing platform enshittification."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow presents a theory of 'enshittification' — a degradation of internet platforms — arguing that over time, platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber shift from user-friendly, innovative beginnings to profit-driven, exploitative models. The process occurs in three stages: (1) user acquisition with strong network effects; (2) prioritization of business customers at user expense; and (3) profit extraction through junk fees, algorithm manipulation, and poor search quality. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak consumer regulations, especially the consumer welfare standard. He proposes policy solutions such as the right-to-exit and interoperability to restore user trust and competition. Though Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, the theory has gained cultural and political traction, especially in discussions about antitrust and digital monopolies.",
