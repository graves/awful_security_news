  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a move that drew national attention, President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a former U.S. Representative from New York, who was convicted in 2024 of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft after being expelled from Congress in 2023. Santos had lied about his education, employment, and background, leading to accusations of widespread fraud and deception. Despite being removed from office without a criminal conviction, he began serving a prison term in July 2024. Trump announced the commutation on October 18, 2025, releasing Santos from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey. The decision was framed as a political statement, with Trump comparing Santos' actions to Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s past misstatement about military service, arguing that Santos' crimes were not as severe. This commutation is part of a broader pattern of executive pardons and commutations by Trump, including over 1,500 individuals linked to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who was pardoned in both his first and second terms.",
