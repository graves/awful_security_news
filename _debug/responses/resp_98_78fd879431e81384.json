  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A trade dispute between the United States and China over the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia — whose parent company Wingtech Technologies was listed under US trade restrictions — has triggered a Chinese export ban on Nexperia China operations. This has raised fears of global auto plant shutdowns due to the critical role Nexperia plays in producing chips for essential car functions such as fuel delivery and braking. With Nexperia supplying about 40% of automotive transistors and diodes, the disruption threatens supply chains globally, with automakers warning that replacement parts are hard to source and recovery could take months. The situation is compounded by existing tariffs and soaring car prices, with average US new car prices now exceeding $50,000. Automaker trade groups are urging immediate diplomatic action to resolve the crisis and prevent cascading disruptions across the global auto industry.",
