Ukrainian officials, including Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko and regional governors, reported the damage and declared emergency alerts.

A surprise phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin further complicated diplomatic prospects, with both leaders initially agreeing to talks that were later canceled.",
