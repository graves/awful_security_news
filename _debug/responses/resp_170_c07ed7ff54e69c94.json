  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough that has enabled new treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full announcement schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, covering physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics. The prizes, established by Alfred Nobel’s will, are awarded by specialized institutions and emphasize long-term, globally beneficial contributions. While scientific prizes like the 2024 awards in physics and chemistry reflect transformative advances in AI and protein research, the Peace Prize remains politically charged, with public debate centered on Donald Trump’s claims of deserving the prize for ending wars—despite expert skepticism due to the prize’s focus on durable peace and institutional efforts. Experts also warn that political interference, such as under the Trump administration, threatens academic freedom, a core value of the Nobel tradition. This year’s prizes highlight both the enduring importance of scientific discovery and the complex interplay of politics, ethics, and global events in shaping public perception of the awards.",
