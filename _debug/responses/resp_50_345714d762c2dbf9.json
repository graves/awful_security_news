  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under a fragile ceasefire. With 18 hostages still missing, Israel accuses Hamas of withholding bodies and using them as leverage, despite claims that all accessible remains have been handed over. The ceasefire faces strain from Israeli military actions, such as the killing of a Palestinian family crossing the yellow line, and the failure to open key humanitarian crossings like Rafah, which remains closed pending Hamas’s compliance. Humanitarian aid is severely limited due to only two open crossings and deteriorating conditions. Meanwhile, Phase Two negotiations in Egypt are focusing on Gaza’s demilitarization, governance, and the formation of an international force, with a Trump-backed 20-point plan proposing a non-political Palestinian administration and a multinational stabilization force. Hamas remains ambiguous on disarmament, and international participation in the ISF is still being negotiated, with some countries demanding a UN mandate.",
