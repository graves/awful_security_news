  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a significant improvement in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, the real prize for Ukraine — a lasting peace — remains out of reach. President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky includes both promises of a ceasefire at current battle lines and ambiguous threats of supplying Tomahawk missiles, a move that could escalate tensions though it is largely symbolic due to logistical and financial constraints. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have maintained key positions like Pokrovsk, Kupiansk, and Kostyantynivka despite Russian offensives, signaling resilience. The article emphasizes that Putin is facing growing internal and economic pressures, including energy shortages and military stalemates, making prolonged conflict unsustainable. Zelensky has pivoted from advocating for NATO membership to showcasing Ukraine's advanced drone technology as a new diplomatic and military asset. Trump’s admission that he has been 'played' by Putin reflects a shift toward realism in U.S. diplomacy, and the upcoming Budapest summit may become a pivotal moment where Putin seeks more time, while international pressures — including from India — further strain Russia’s global support.",
