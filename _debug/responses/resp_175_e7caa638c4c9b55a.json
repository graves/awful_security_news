    "Meta and Snap argue that the 1990s Communications Decency Act shields them from liability for user-generated content, but the court ruled that negligence and harm caused by app design remain actionable.",
    "The judge emphasized that CEO testimony is critical to assess the companies' knowledge of risks and failure to act, stating that such testimony reveals 'knowledge of harms and failure to take available steps to avoid such harms'.",
    "Legal representatives argue that the companies deliberately maintained harmful features, fearing business losses, which may indicate a lack of prioritizing user safety.",
    "This case is significant as it represents a major legal challenge to social media platforms' business models and design choices, with implications for how technology companies are held accountable for user well-being."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mark Zuckerberg, along with Evan Spiegel and Adam Mosseri, is required to testify in a landmark U.S. trial over the impact of social media on young people’s mental health. The case, consolidated in 2022 and expected to begin in January 2025, accuses Meta Platforms, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube of designing addictive apps with features like 'likes' that keep youth engaged despite awareness of mental health risks. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, led by Judge Carolyn Kuhl, ruled that CEO testimony is essential to assess knowledge of harm and failure to act, rejecting the companies' argument that they are protected by 1990s federal laws. The plaintiffs, including parents and school districts, argue that companies prioritized profits over user safety, and the ruling underscores growing legal and public pressure on social media platforms to take responsibility for their design and safety features.",
