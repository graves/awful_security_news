The commutation came following Santos' public appeal for 'fairness' and criticism of the system, and was supported by Republican lawmakers including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Anna Paulina Luna. However, the decision drew criticism from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who argued that Trump should have prioritized national issues like healthcare over individual clemency. The case highlights tensions between presidential clemency, political loyalty, and the principle of accountability in the justice system.",
