  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early peanut introduction in infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies by over 80%, new research shows that real-world implementation of these guidelines has led to a significant decline in childhood peanut allergies in the U.S. Between 2015 and 2017, the rate of peanut allergies in children aged 0 to 3 dropped by more than 27% and over 40%, respectively. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and based on analysis of electronic health records, confirms that the public health effort is making measurable impact, with about 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies since 2015. Despite initial resistance and slow adoption by medical professionals—only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists followed the 2017 guidelines—widespread adoption and evidence of success have reinforced the recommendation to introduce peanuts and other major allergens between four and six months of age, without prior screening. Advocacy groups like FARE and professionals such as dietitian Tiffany Leon are promoting early exposure as a safe, evidence-based strategy to reduce food allergy prevalence nationwide.",
