  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after over a week of violent cross-border fighting that killed dozens and injured hundreds, marking the deadliest crisis between the two nations in several years. The conflict intensified following a suicide bombing in Pakistan’s Mir Ali region, prompting a cross-border airstrike by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, which reportedly killed at least 10 civilians, including three local cricketers. Afghan officials and the Taliban condemned Pakistan’s actions as a violation of sovereignty and a deliberate attempt to prolong hostilities. The ceasefire was mediated by Qatar and Turkey, with both nations agreeing to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and hold follow-up talks. The crisis underscores deep-rooted tensions over the disputed Durand Line, cross-border militant activity, and regional stability. The tragedy has also led to the Afghan national cricket board boycotting an upcoming series in Pakistan, with the ICC expressing sorrow over the loss of young athletes.",
