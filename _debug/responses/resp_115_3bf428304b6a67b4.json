  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study reveals that black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify both their social behavior and nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants self-isolate, and healthy ants, especially nurses, increase their distance from foragers — a form of proactive social distancing. Additionally, the ants construct more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with spaced entrances and longer travel routes, which reduces disease transmission. These structural changes, combined with social behavior, enhance colony resilience. The research, conducted by Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie and published in Science, demonstrates the first known case of a non-human social species actively altering its environment to respond to a disease threat. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest that these natural strategies could inspire future designs of human public spaces to better prevent disease spread through architectural immunity.",
