  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge — including observation of natural signs, animal behavior, and traditional warning signals like gunfire — is proving essential in saving lives during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially as government early warning systems fail due to malfunctions, lack of maintenance, and community distrust. Despite significant investments, such as the $37 million GLOF-II project, residents in areas like Skardu and Ghizer continue to rely on local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain to detect and respond to disasters. These individuals use time-tested, culturally embedded practices to save villages, demonstrating both the effectiveness and resilience of traditional knowledge. With Pakistan facing rising temperatures and a growing number of climate-related disasters, the article underscores a critical need to integrate Indigenous knowledge into formal disaster management frameworks to build trust, enhance resilience, and ensure effective climate adaptation.",
