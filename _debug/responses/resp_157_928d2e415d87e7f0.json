  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that daily food supplies to Gaza remain critically low at 750 metric tonnes—well below the 2,000-tonne target—due to only two border crossings being open. The crossings at Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara allow limited aid entry, mostly to the south and center of Gaza. Despite expanding food distribution points to 26, the WFP still falls short of its goal of 145 points. The US-brokered ceasefire under Donald Trump is seen as essential for enabling aid access, particularly in northern Gaza, where aid is only reaching via the south. Hamas has committed to returning 13 of 28 captives' bodies, with two more to be delivered, which may facilitate future openings of crossings. The WFP notes that food deliveries are sufficient for only half a million people for two weeks, and many Gazans are storing food due to fears of renewed conflict, highlighting a severe and worsening humanitarian crisis.",
