  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, through its space agency SUPARCO. This marks a major milestone in Pakistan’s space programme, enabling advanced Earth observation for applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. The satellite can detect subtle material changes on the ground, allowing for precise crop quality assessment and geohazard identification. The launch reflects a deepening strategic partnership between Pakistan and China, with the technology expected to support key development initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). While H1 is expected to be fully operational within about two months, two other satellites—EO-1 and KS-1—have already been deployed and are fully operational. This achievement underscores Pakistan’s growing ambition in space technology and its commitment to using space-based data for national development and resilience.",
