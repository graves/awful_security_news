  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, former U.S. President Donald Trump denied Ukraine access to long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which Zelensky had sought to target Russian energy infrastructure. Trump instead urged both Ukraine and Russia to immediately cease hostilities and accept current battle lines, calling for peace through the existing front lines. Zelensky proposed a trade of Ukrainian drones for American Tomahawks, highlighting Ukraine’s drone capabilities and military needs. Trump previously supported land swaps but later stated that Ukraine could recover all occupied territory. He also expressed skepticism about the strategic value of Tomahawk missiles, warning that they could damage U.S.-Russia relations. Putin reportedly opposed the use of Tomahawks, arguing they would not affect the battlefield but would strain diplomatic ties. European leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine following the meeting. The article underscores the complex diplomatic and strategic dynamics surrounding the war, with key figures advocating for ceasefire, military trade, and territorial resolution.",
