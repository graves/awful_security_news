  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a survivor of a US military strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean allegedly used for drug smuggling, after the Ecuadorean Attorney General’s office found no criminal evidence against him. The US, under President Donald Trump, claims the vessel was carrying fentanyl and was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for narcotics transport, though experts question the legality and origin of the drugs. The operation, which began in September 2025, has resulted in at least 32 deaths across seven strikes and has drawn international criticism, including from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US of violating Colombian territorial waters. The US has accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of running the Cartel of the Suns, a drug trafficking group, and has intensified pressure on Venezuela through covert operations. The two survivors—Tufiño and Jeison Obando Pérez—are the first known to survive such attacks, with the Colombian survivor suffering a serious injury. The operation involves a massive US military deployment, including around 10,000 troops and numerous aircraft and ships, and has sparked regional debate over sovereignty, legality, and the humanitarian impact of military interventions.",
