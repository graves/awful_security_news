  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Justice Department prosecutors are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s right to represent James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Fitzgerald denies the claims, asserting that the memos shared with his attorneys were unclassified at the time and that the government later upclassified them. The dispute raises serious ethical and legal questions about conflict of interest, especially given that Fitzgerald may have been a witness to events involving Comey’s interactions with President Trump. Legal experts highlight that a person cannot be both a witness and a defense attorney in the same case, adding weight to the controversy. Both sides point to the timing and content of the memoranda, with the government citing 'quarantined evidence' and Fitzgerald emphasizing the original unclassified status of the documents.",
