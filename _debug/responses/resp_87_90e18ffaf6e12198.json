  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping is convening the fourth plenum to present and approve China’s next five-year economic strategy, running from 2026 to 2030, with a focus on technological innovation in AI, quantum computing, biotechnology, and new energy. This comes amid growing friction with the United States, domestic economic slowdown (with Q3 2025 growth at 4.8%), and deepening internal political purges—most notably the removal of General He Weidong and Miao Hua from the Central Military Commission. The event is also politically significant as it occurs just before a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leaders, heightening global geopolitical tensions. Despite economic headwinds, analysts expect Xi to maintain a stable, centralized direction, with only minor adjustments such as addressing overcapacity and boosting domestic consumption. The plenum also signals a major reshuffling of key party and military positions, reinforcing Xi’s absolute control over China’s political and military apparatus.",
