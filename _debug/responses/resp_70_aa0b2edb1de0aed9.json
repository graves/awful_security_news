  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An American Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines, Flight 6469, made an emergency landing in Nebraska after pilots lost contact with flight attendants and heard banging on the cockpit door. The flight, an Embraer ERJ 175, departed from Omaha’s Eppley Airfield at 6:41 p.m. and turned around just 18 minutes later due to a malfunction in the inter-phone system. Passengers, including Henry Gruver and his family, were unaware of the issue until police boarded the plane. The FAA and SkyWest identified the problem as a failure in the flight crew's microphone system, which prevented communication between the cockpit and cabin staff. After landing, the aircraft was evacuated, and the flight eventually took off again five hours late, resulting in the Gruver family missing their connection to Japan and waiting overnight at the airport. SkyWest and American Airlines have not contacted the passengers since the incident.",
