  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During an ongoing government shutdown, many national parks in the U.S. remain open despite the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees, raising significant concerns about safety, environmental damage, and the impact on local economies. Visitors like Nudrat Mahajabin continue to access parks such as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite, often without rangers or entrance fees, leading to increased illegal activities like drone use and base jumping. While some local businesses report no immediate loss, others—especially small ones in West Virginia and D.C.—face declining bookings or financial strain. In West Virginia, state funds and political leadership under Governor Patrick Morrisey have kept key parks open for events like Bridge Day, highlighting tourism’s economic importance. Meanwhile, private museums in Washington, D.C., see a surge in visitors due to closures of the Smithsonian and National Zoo. Advocacy groups warn that the absence of staff weakens emergency response, increases vandalism, and risks park ecosystems, with volunteer cleanup efforts already underway in places like Rocky Mountain National Park. The article underscores both the resilience of tourism and the urgent need for policy decisions that balance public access with safety and environmental sustainability.",
