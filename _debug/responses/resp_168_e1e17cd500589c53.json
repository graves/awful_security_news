  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, marking a major milestone in its space programme. Developed by SUPARCO, the H1 satellite uses hyperspectral imaging to detect subtle material changes on Earth’s surface, enabling improved monitoring of agriculture, water resources, urban development, and disaster risks. The satellite is expected to enhance national capacity in precision agriculture, climate resilience, and environmental management, with potential applications in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Although full operational status is expected in about two months, it is part of a broader trend of Pakistan launching three satellites in 2025, including two fully operational ones (EO-1 and KS-1). The launch reflects Pakistan’s growing technological ambition and its deep strategic partnership with China in peaceful space exploration.",
