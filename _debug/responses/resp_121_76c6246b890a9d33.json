Cards Against Humanity claimed SpaceX placed gravel and debris on the land for at least six months, and admitted during discovery that trespassing occurred. The company sought $15 million in damages for loss of vegetation and natural state, but opted for settlement to avoid costly litigation. As part of the resolution, SpaceX removed construction equipment, and Cards Against Humanity plans to restore the land through landscaping. The case underscores tensions between commercial space development and private property rights, especially in border regions.",
