  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the Trump administration intensifies its military and intelligence operations in Venezuela, including deploying B-52 bombers, authorizing CIA covert actions, and launching strikes on drug boats, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro responds with large-scale military mobilization, claiming over 8 million militia members and denouncing U.S. efforts as a conspiracy to overthrow his regime. The article highlights the growing geopolitical tension in the Caribbean, fueled by the U.S. argument that drug trafficking and migrant flows pose an imminent threat, justifying military action. Despite no direct targeting of Maduro, the threat of war looms, with Venezuelans expressing fear and anxiety, and internal U.S. military officials raising legal and ethical concerns. The situation underscores a dangerous escalation in foreign policy, with both sides engaging in militarized rhetoric and actions, while civilians live in uncertainty and the broader region faces potential destabilization.",
