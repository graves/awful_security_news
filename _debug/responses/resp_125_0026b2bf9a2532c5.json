  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing, traditionally home to the first lady's offices, to construct a $250 million ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite not securing approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. The project, which is set to be completed by January 2029, is being privately funded and claimed to accommodate up to 999 people, far exceeding earlier estimates. Trump asserts that the ballroom is long overdue and necessary due to the limited size of the East Room, while also claiming it will not interfere with the mansion’s structure. The demolition and construction have sparked concerns over regulatory compliance, historical damage, and transparency, as no donor information has been disclosed and the commission's offices are closed due to a government shutdown. Carrier Global Corp. has donated an HVAC system, and the White House has confirmed temporary relocation of East Wing offices.",
