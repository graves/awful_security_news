  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A surge in cowboy imagery across fashion, media, and politics in 2025 reflects a deep-rooted cultural mythologizing of the American West. While popularized by 19th-century Buffalo Bill shows and cemented by Hollywood figures like Gene Autry and John Wayne, the current trend is heavily tied to political conservatism, particularly under the Trump administration, which leverages cowboy symbolism to promote individualism and patriotism. Media platforms such as Vogue, 'Yellowstone,' and Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour have amplified the image, often in ways that omit the historical diversity and hardship of real cowboys — who were primarily Mexican, Native American, or Black. Despite this, recent efforts by Black photographers like Gabriela Hasbun and cultural figures like Beyoncé have brought greater visibility to Black cowboys and rodeo culture. However, these advances are often followed by a process of 'whitewashing,' where mainstream narratives revert to romanticized, homogenized versions of the cowboy. The article underscores that while the cowboy is a powerful cultural symbol, its current popularity is not a reflection of reality but a cyclical, politicized, and commercialized myth.",
