  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated its military campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, particularly targeting key power stations like Thermal Station 5 in Kyiv, using a new wave of modified drones and missiles that evade Western air defenses. The October 10 strike, involving 465 drones and 32 missiles, caused widespread outages and destruction, leaving millions without power or water and exposing Ukraine’s vulnerability during an expected harsh winter. Despite years of attacks since 2022, Ukraine’s infrastructure remains under threat due to both advanced Russian tactics and internal failures, including corruption in defense spending. Civilians are responding by stockpiling fuel, power banks, and alternative heating sources, while analysts warn that the combination of weather, destruction, and inadequate recovery capacity could lead to a devastating winter crisis.",
