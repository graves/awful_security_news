  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, in October 2025, saw thieves in yellow vests scale a truck-mounted ladder and use an angle grinder to enter the Apollo Gallery, where they stole nine Napoleonic jewels in just four minutes. This incident marks a shift in museum crime, where thieves now target artifacts for their raw materials—such as gold, diamonds, and metals—rather than for their cultural or artistic value. The heist is seen as a case of 'cultural terrorism' with military precision, echoing the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden. Experts, including Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath, warn that this trend reflects a growing threat to global cultural heritage due to the use of industrial tools and the weakening of museum security. Evidence such as discarded tools, a damaged crown of Empress Eugénie, and a walkie-talkie was found at the scene. French authorities suspect a connection between the Louvre heist and earlier thefts in Paris and Limoges, possibly tied to organized crime groups like the Remmo Clan. Interpol has added the stolen items to its database, and French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin condemned the security failures. The incident highlights a broader pattern of increasing aggression and industrialization in museum theft, raising serious concerns about the long-term preservation of cultural history.",
