  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to challenge a three-count indictment alleging she physically interfered with ICE officers during a May 2025 oversight visit at a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. The incident involved efforts by McIver and other Democratic lawmakers to inspect the facility, which were interrupted when ICE officials blocked access and later arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for trespassing—charges later dropped. Prosecutors claim McIver slammed and grabbed agents, while her attorneys argue her actions were part of legitimate legislative oversight protected by the Speech or Debate Clause. The case is being framed as politically motivated, with McIver's team alleging selective prosecution and retaliation against her progressive views, especially in contrast to President Donald Trump’s pardons of Capitol riot participants. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that DHS social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or linking the incident to Antifa activity are prejudicial and ordered them removed. Other Democratic lawmakers present at the incident were not charged, raising concerns about bias. The trial is scheduled for November 10, 2025, and McIver’s legal team continues to emphasize that the prosecution is part of a broader political agenda targeting 'wokeness.'",
