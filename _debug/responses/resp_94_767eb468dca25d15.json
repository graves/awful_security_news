  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned from Gaza to Israel, following a ceasefire that entered its second week. The return of the two bodies—Oakkharasri and Ronen Engel—has been met with both cautious optimism and growing public frustration, as Israel continues military operations and Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains. The situation remains strained due to the delayed return of the remaining hostages, the closure of the Rafah crossing, and allegations from both sides of violations of ceasefire terms. The US has warned of a potential Hamas ceasefire violation, while Israeli officials stress that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is demilitarized. Protests have erupted in Israel, and international actors are urging compliance with the agreement, highlighting the deep human, political, and humanitarian stakes of the ongoing hostage crisis.",
