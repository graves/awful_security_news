  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following Diwali celebrations, New Delhi experienced the world’s most polluted air, with PM2.5 levels more than 40 times the WHO safety threshold. This spike is attributed to widespread use of firecrackers, including non-compliant and non-green types, despite a 2020 ban and a 2025 Supreme Court permit for limited green firecracker use. The pollution is compounded by seasonal stubble burning by farmers in surrounding regions, and long-standing government efforts like traffic restrictions and smog towers have failed due to poor enforcement. Residents report severe health impacts, including respiratory distress and eye irritation, highlighting a deep-rooted environmental crisis in India that extends beyond New Delhi to other major cities like Kolkata and Mumbai.",
