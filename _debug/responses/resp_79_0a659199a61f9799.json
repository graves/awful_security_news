  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has not ruled out sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine during his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite Putin's opposition and concerns over escalation. While Trump has not committed to providing the weapons during his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the administration has prepared plans to deploy them if deemed necessary. Zelensky views the missiles as a strategic tool to pressure Russia into negotiations, while Putin argues they would damage the U.S.-Russia relationship and threaten major Russian cities. The prospect of a meeting in Budapest, brokered by Putin, suggests a temporary diplomatic pause, though Trump continues to maintain the threat as leverage in broader diplomatic efforts to end the war.",
