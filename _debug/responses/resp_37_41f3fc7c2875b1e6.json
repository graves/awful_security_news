  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two cases of clade I mpox have been reported in California — one in Long Beach and one in Los Angeles County — potentially marking the first local transmission of this virus in the U.S. Health officials say the risk to the general public remains low, as no close contacts have been confirmed to be infected and no widespread transmission has been proven. Both patients were hospitalized and are now recovering at home. Experts express concern that the virus could be spreading locally, especially given the weakened public health infrastructure due to a federal government shutdown and CDC staffing cuts. This outbreak is significant because it involves a different strain of mpox (clade I), which is more broadly transmissible and affects a wider demographic than the 2022 clade II outbreak. While the World Health Organization previously declared a public health emergency for clade I in Africa, it has since been downgraded. Local health officials have taken steps to monitor the situation and offer vaccines to close contacts, but ongoing investigations are essential to rule out community transmission.",
