  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iran has declared that all provisions of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — including nuclear restrictions — are terminated as the agreement expires after 10 years, with the termination effectively rendered meaningless due to the UK, Germany, and France triggering the 'snapback' mechanism that re-imposed UN sanctions. The US withdrew from the deal in 2018, leading to the revival of Iran’s nuclear programme, and following a 12-day war in June 2024, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA, citing the agency’s lack of condemnation of US-Israeli strikes. While Iran maintains openness to diplomacy under conditions of US non-military engagement, it no longer sees value in negotiating with Europe, which initiated the snapback. The IAEA has expressed serious concern over its inability to verify Iran’s nuclear stockpiles, and nuclear talks remain deadlocked, with experts concluding that the deal has effectively ended in practice.",
