The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter, becoming the first team to do so after leading by 18 points or more after three quarters, thanks to a standout performance by second-year quarterback Bo Nix. The Green Bay Packers also pulled off a late comeback against the Arizona Cardinals, aided by defensive dominance from Micah Parsons. Meanwhile, New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye broke Tom Brady’s franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate in a 31-13 win over the Tennessee Titans, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of his passes, throw over 200 yards, and rush over 50 yards in a single game. On the downside, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets suffered significant losses, with Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields respectively being benched due to poor performances, highlighting ongoing quarterback instability and roster challenges. The season continues to be marked by volatility, with 26 lead changes in the final two minutes of regulation—the most in NFL history over the first seven weeks.",
