The satellite, developed by SUPARCO, uses advanced hyperspectral technology to detect subtle material changes on Earth, enabling improved monitoring of agriculture, water resources, and disaster risks. The launch is part of a broader effort to strengthen national capabilities in precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure development—particularly within the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). While the satellite requires about two months of calibration before full operation, it reflects Pakistan’s growing space ambitions and deepening strategic partnership with China. Two other satellites (EO-1 and KS-1) are already operational, indicating a rapidly expanding national space program.",
