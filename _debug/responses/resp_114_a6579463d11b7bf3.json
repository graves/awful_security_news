  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Every year, an estimated billion birds in the United States die from collisions with glass windows, primarily during migration season. Birds are unable to perceive glass as a barrier, mistaking it for open sky or trees—especially with transparent or reflective surfaces. This problem is most severe in large urban buildings with extensive glass, such as Chicago’s McCormick Place Convention Center, where a mass collision in 2023 led to national attention and the formation of the Bird Collision Prevention Alliance (BCPA), a coalition of over 100 organizations including federal agencies and research groups. The alliance focuses on science-based solutions, such as installing window films with dot patterns that reduce collisions by up to 95%, as demonstrated in Chicago. In cities like Dallas, buildings identified as major killers—like the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center—are being retrofitted or redesigned with bird-friendly features. Community efforts, such as those led by Lights Out DC in Washington, D.C., involve volunteers monitoring collisions and advocating for changes like turning off lights and treating windows. While political challenges, such as weakened federal protections under the Trump administration, exist, the focus remains on scalable, practical solutions. The article underscores that both large-scale urban planning and individual actions—like treating home windows—can collectively make a significant impact in saving migratory birds.",
