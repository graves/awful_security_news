  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite President Donald Trump's claim of a major international victory with the Gaza ceasefire deal, public sentiment in the U.S. shows little enthusiasm. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC reveals that while Trump’s approval on the Gaza issue rose slightly, disapproval remained high, and his overall approval rating reached a low point in his second term. More significantly, public disapproval of Trump's economic policies—especially inflation and the cost of living—has reached a new low, with widespread pessimism about the economy and job security. Americans appear to prioritize domestic economic issues over foreign policy, with only 4% considering international events the top national concern. This suggests that even a high-profile diplomatic success fails to bolster Trump’s political standing, as economic fears continue to dominate public perception.",
