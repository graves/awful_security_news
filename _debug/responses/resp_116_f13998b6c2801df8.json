  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the midst of a federal government shutdown and deep political polarization, over 500 volunteers from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, including individuals from diverse political backgrounds such as Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and John Manna, united in Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress for increased cancer research funding, expanded cancer screening access, and continued health insurance subsidies. Despite differing political affiliations—Johnson voted for Donald Trump three times, Mealing is a Democrat, and Manna is a Reagan Republican—the group emphasized that 'cancer doesn't care,' highlighting a shared personal bond that transcended partisan divides. The event, held on September 16, 2025, saw volunteers visit 484 congressional offices, successfully gaining bipartisan support for research and screening, though insurance subsidies remained a point of contention. The day culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall honoring those impacted by cancer, reinforcing the power of empathy and shared experience in bridging political divides.",
