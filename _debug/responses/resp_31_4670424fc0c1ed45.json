    "Prosecutors allege that James Comey used his lead defense attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, to disseminate classified information in 2017, which could create a conflict of interest and potentially disqualify Fitzgerald from representing Comey.",
    "Patrick Fitzgerald denies the allegations, citing a Justice Department inspector general report that found no evidence of classified material being released by Comey or his attorneys.",
    "The memos written by Comey in 2017 were initially unclassified and shared with his attorneys; Fitzgerald asserts that they were not classified at the time of transmission.",
    "The U.S. Department of Justice claims that the memos were later 'upclassified,' implying they may have contained sensitive information, but Comey's team argues that upclassification does not negate their original unclassified status.",
    "Legal experts, including Elie Honig, note that a lawyer cannot be both a witness and a defense counsel in the same case, raising ethical concerns if Fitzgerald was part of a leak chain.",
    "The dispute centers on the ethical and legal integrity of Fitzgerald's representation, with both sides asserting claims about the nature and classification of the memos."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging Patrick Fitzgerald, James Comey’s lead defense attorney, over allegations that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Prosecutors claim that the memos Comey wrote about his interactions with President Trump were later classified, implying a breach of confidentiality, while Fitzgerald counters that the memos were unclassified at the time they were shared and that the government’s claim is based on a misreading of classification status. The dispute raises serious ethical questions about Fitzgerald's ability to serve as counsel, given the potential conflict of interest, and is seen by legal experts as a critical issue in the broader context of accountability and transparency in political investigations.",
