  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has shelved plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, following a productive call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that rendered a preparatory meeting unnecessary. While Trump advocated for a ceasefire at the current front line to end the war in Ukraine, Russia insists on complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Donbas and the demilitarisation of Ukraine—positions that Kyiv and European allies reject. The only issue that appears to have prompted Russia’s diplomatic engagement is the potential US supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which could lead to deep strikes into Russian territory. This shift in dynamics reflects ongoing strategic disagreements over the conflict’s resolution and suggests that without addressing core territorial demands, peace talks remain stalled.",
