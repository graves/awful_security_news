The return of these bodies has intensified pressure on both sides, with Hamas claiming it has handed over all accessible remains and accusing Israel of violations, while Israel asserts that Hamas holds knowledge of missing bodies and may be using them as leverage.

The US State Department warns of an imminent Hamas ceasefire violation, and protests have erupted in Israel over the slow return of bodies.
