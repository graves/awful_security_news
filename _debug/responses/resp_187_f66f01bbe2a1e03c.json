  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the question of whether Hamas will relinquish control of Gaza after two years of war, during which it lost key leaders and faced severe internal and external pressure. While the Trump 20-point peace plan proposes a transitional governance structure and disarmament, the article questions its feasibility given the ongoing violence, Hamas’s use of brutal tactics against rivals, and the group’s deep-rooted military infrastructure. Despite the deaths of prominent leaders like Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, Hamas remains active through fragmented cells and new recruits. Experts debate whether Hamas will rebrand as a political entity or continue as a militant force, with some believing it may transition like the ANC in South Africa, while others predict continued conflict and dominance. The article highlights the role of regional actors—Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, and Iran—in supporting or pressuring Hamas, and underscores the humanitarian crisis, tunnel network, and ideological challenges that make any peaceful transition uncertain.",
