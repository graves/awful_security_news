  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary was sentenced to two to four years in prison for sexually assaulting Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College in 2013. The case remained unresolved for over a decade due to institutional inaction, including the destruction of the rape kit and prosecutorial reluctance to file charges. After Cleary was extradited from France in 2024 on a vagrancy charge, the case was revived when Keeler, the victim, renewed her efforts after seeing a Facebook message from Cleary in 2019. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, considered Cleary’s guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness when handing down a sentence below state guidelines. Keeler described the case as a long-standing emotional wound, stating that the justice system had failed her for years. The case highlights broader issues in campus sexual assault prosecution, including evidence destruction, lack of support, and difficulties in tracking perpetrators across international borders.",
