  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has ended its 50+ year partnership with China by sending three giant pandas—Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji—back to China, marking a significant shift in U.S.-China diplomatic relations. This program, initiated in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit and popularized by First Lady Pat Nixon, was used as a symbol of 'panda diplomacy' to strengthen bilateral ties. China owns the pandas and their offspring, and U.S. zoos have paid for conservation efforts, with Atlanta contributing over $16 million. As relations deteriorate and public sentiment in China grows critical of U.S. treatment of pandas, the program is ending. With the return of pandas from Scotland and Australia, only Xin Xin in Mexico City remains in the Americas. While the National Zoo remains hopeful about future panda returns, the decline in U.S. and Western panda programs reflects broader diplomatic tensions and a reevaluation of China’s use of pandas as diplomatic tools.",
