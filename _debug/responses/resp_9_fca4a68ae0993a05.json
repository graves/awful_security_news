  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi experienced a severe spike in air pollution, with PM2.5 levels exceeding the WHO’s annual guideline by over 40 times. This surge is attributed to both traditional and non-compliant firecrackers — including banned and unregulated 'green' ones — used during festivities. The pollution is compounded by year-round agricultural stubble burning in surrounding areas. Despite prior bans and government initiatives such as smog towers and traffic restrictions, enforcement remains weak, and public health impacts are significant. Residents report persistent health issues, such as throat and eye irritation, highlighting the ongoing crisis. The issue extends beyond Delhi, with Kolkata and Mumbai also ranking among the world’s most polluted cities. This illustrates a broader national environmental challenge where economic growth and cultural traditions conflict with public health and pollution control efforts.",
