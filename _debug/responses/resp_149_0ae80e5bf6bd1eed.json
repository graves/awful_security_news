  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of drone attacks, attributed to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), targeted Khartoum international airport and other areas in Sudan’s capital just one day before its long-awaited reopening. The attacks, which included more than eight blasts and the use of 'suicide drones', have severely disrupted efforts to resume domestic flights and undermined confidence in the country’s recovery. Despite the Sudanese army reclaiming control of Khartoum earlier in 2025, the RSF continues to launch attacks on military installations and civilian infrastructure, including Omdurman. These strikes reflect broader instability, with the RSF attempting to seize el-Fasher in Darfur—a move that could trigger ethnic violence and further displacement. The wider conflict has already killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million people, creating the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. The Sudan Civil Aviation Authority has announced a gradual return of flights, but the threat to key infrastructure remains a major concern for national stability and humanitarian recovery.",
