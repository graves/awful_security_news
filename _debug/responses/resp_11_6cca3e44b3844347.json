    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its extreme cold, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes of the species Culiseta annulata.",
    "The discovery was made in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who noticed and collected a fly at dusk on October 16, 2025.",
    "The mosquitoes were identified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, who confirmed them as Culiseta annulata, a species native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates.",
    "This is the first recorded instance of mosquitoes occurring naturally in Iceland, as opposed to a single isolated case from an airplane in the past.",
    "Possible introduction mechanisms include ships or cargo containers, though the exact pathway remains unclear.",
    "Scientists are uncertain whether climate change directly caused the discovery, but warming temperatures may increase the likelihood of future mosquito establishment in Iceland.",
    "Mosquitoes are expanding their range globally due to climate change, and this discovery may reflect broader ecological shifts linked to warming.",
    "Experts emphasize that while climate change may contribute, it is not definitively proven as the cause, and more research is needed on mosquito range shifts in cold regions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long protected by its extreme cold from mosquitoes, has confirmed the first wild occurrence of the species Culiseta annulata in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, after being discovered by Björn Hjaltason in October 2025. The mosquitoes were identified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marking a significant ecological shift. Although the exact method of arrival remains unclear—possibly via ships or cargo—the species is known to thrive in cold climates. While climate change may have increased the potential for such species to establish in Iceland, experts remain cautious, noting that prior mosquito sightings in northern Scandinavia suggest natural range shifts may already be underway. This discovery underscores broader global trends of mosquito range expansion due to warming temperatures, offering a key case study for understanding climate-driven ecological change.",
