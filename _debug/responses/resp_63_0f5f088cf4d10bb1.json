    "A mysterious diffuse glow detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at the center of the Milky Way has sparked debate over whether it is caused by pulsars or dark matter.",
    "New supercomputer simulations show that dark matter — specifically WIMPs — could produce a bulge-shaped glow due to its compressed, egg-shaped distribution in the galactic center, matching the observed shape of the gamma-ray emission.",
    "Although the dark matter theory previously struggled due to shape mismatches with a spherical model, recent simulations show a squashed, non-spherical dark matter distribution that aligns with the observed glow pattern.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate by 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to determine whether the glow originates from dark matter annihilation or pulsars.",
    "Scientists like Joseph Silk, Tracy Slatyer, Chamkaur Ghag, and Nico Cappelluti highlight that dark matter — particularly WIMPs — remains a compelling and elegant explanation, even without direct detection, and that this research sustains hope in the long-term hunt for dark matter.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists are investigating a mysterious diffuse glow detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at the center of the Milky Way, which has long been explained either by pulsars or by dark matter. While earlier models suggested a spherical dark matter distribution didn’t match the observed bulge-like shape, new supercomputer simulations show that dark matter could have a squashed, egg-shaped structure that aligns with the glow's shape. This adds significant weight to the dark matter theory, particularly involving WIMPs — hypothetical particles that annihilate and emit gamma rays. The study, led by Joseph Silk and published in Physical Review Letters, suggests a 50% chance the glow is due to dark matter. However, the ultimate confirmation will come from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to begin operations in 2027, which will provide higher-resolution data. This discovery could mark a breakthrough in understanding dark matter — a fundamental component of the universe that has remained elusive for decades.",
