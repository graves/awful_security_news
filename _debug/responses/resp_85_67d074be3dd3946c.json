The article highlights Trump’s use of executive power—such as pardoning George Santos and authorizing military actions abroad—as evidence of an expanding imperial presidency, raising constitutional and democratic concerns. Despite Trump’s dismissive claims that the protests were 'a joke,' demonstrators across 50 states affirmed their commitment to democratic values and free speech. Critics, including legal experts and Republican senators, argue that such actions violate constitutional norms and undermine democratic checks. The protests, with over 7 million participants, signal a growing public resistance to authoritarian tendencies and may foreshadow broader resistance in the coming months.",
