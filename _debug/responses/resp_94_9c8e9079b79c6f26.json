This performance made Ohtani the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game and the first to hit a leadoff home run in such a setting. The feat occurred after pitching just 13 days earlier, marking a rare physical achievement. Ohtani earned the NLCS MVP award and was celebrated as a defining moment in baseball history. The Los Angeles Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Brewers in four games, securing their place in the World Series for the first time since 2024.

With the Seattle Mariners leading the ALCS 3–2 against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Dodgers’ World Series opponent remains uncertain, but their depth and star power—centered on Ohtani—make them a formidable challenge.
