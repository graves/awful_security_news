  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator and son of former president Jaime Paz Zamora, has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election with 54% of the vote, defeating right-wing candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga. This victory marks a significant shift in a country long dominated by the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party, which has faced growing public frustration over economic mismanagement, inflation, and fuel shortages. Paz's campaign, supported by the Christian Democratic Party, appeals to working-class and Indigenous voters in regions like Cochabamba and the Andean highlands with a platform of 'capitalism for all' and gradual reform. His running mate, ex-cop Edman Lara, gained traction through viral anti-corruption videos, bringing a populist, authentic edge to the race. Despite promises to end the fixed exchange rate, phase out fuel subsidies, and reduce public spending, Paz faces criticism over vague fiscal plans and potential economic instability. Bolivia now faces an uphill battle to stabilize its economy, recover foreign currency reserves, and restore confidence in its currency, all while navigating a deep political and class divide between urban elites and rural, working-class communities.",
