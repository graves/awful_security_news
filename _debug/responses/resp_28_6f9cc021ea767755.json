    "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democratic Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva.",
    "Johnson claims he is following a precedent set by Nancy Pelosi, delaying swearing-in until the House returns from recess, but the lawsuit argues this violates the Constitution, which requires sworn-in members to be seated upon meeting qualification standards.",
    "The lawsuit asserts that the Constitution does not grant the Speaker the authority to delay swearing-in a duly elected representative, and that Johnson has no legal or practical reason to deny the oath.",
    "The legal action is framed as a constitutional matter, asserting that Grijalva's election is valid and that her inability to take office undermines democratic representation in Arizona.",
    "The suit claims Johnson’s actions are politically motivated, aimed at delaying a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and strengthening his position in budget negotiations.",
    "Grijalva has not spoken to Johnson since her election and is attempting to meet with him to resolve the dispute.",
    "The case is being heard in Washington, D.C.’s federal court, and seeks a judicial order allowing a qualified individual to administer the oath to Grijalva if Johnson refuses."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s Attorney General Kris Mayes has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democratic Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva. Johnson claims he is following Nancy Pelosi’s precedent by delaying swearing-in until the House returns from recess, but the lawsuit argues that the Constitution mandates that duly elected representatives must be sworn in, regardless of session status. The case asserts that Johnson lacks any legal or practical justification for withholding the oath and that his actions are politically motivated—aimed at delaying a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and strengthening his position in budget negotiations. The lawsuit seeks a court order allowing a qualified individual to administer the oath to Grijalva, emphasizing that the denial of office undermines democratic representation in Arizona and violates constitutional principles of fair and timely representation.",
