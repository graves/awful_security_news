  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is actively investigating the federal government's response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation that led to over 1,000 arrests in Illinois. In a hearing, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for all federal agents on the ground, citing concerns about the lack of warnings before the use of tear gas and pepper balls. While CBP agents are required to use cameras, ICE Special Response Teams are not, and have not received them despite being trained in crowd control and use of force. Testimony from ICE and CBP officials confirmed training and citation authority, but also highlighted a 'revolving door' leadership structure, with key figures like Russell Hott leaving the Chicago area. A pastor, Rev. David Black, claimed he was struck with pepper balls while praying outside the Broadview detention facility without warning. Federal officials denied media reports of tear gas use, claiming the judge relies on 'one-sided' reports, and stated that all use-of-force incidents are reviewed by internal committees. Judge Ellis plans to continue questioning top officials, including Hott and Gregory Bovino, to gain further insight into on-the-ground enforcement decisions.",
