  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippines, thousands of residents from Catanduanes have evacuated their homes due to predicted coastal flooding and strong winds. The storm is expected to pass near the island on Saturday, bringing heavy rainfall and waves up to 1.2 meters. This evacuation is part of a routine drill, given Catanduanes’ history of being the first landmass affected by western Pacific cyclones. The Philippines, which faces 20 storms annually, is still reeling from recent disasters including a magnitude 6.9 and a magnitude 7.4 earthquake, both of which caused significant loss of life and triggered tsunami warnings. Scientists warn that climate change is intensifying storm activity, making such events more frequent and severe. The article underscores the vulnerability of impoverished coastal communities to natural disasters in a warming world.",
