The compact demands the removal of sex and ethnicity from admissions, a 15% cap on international enrollment, mandatory gender definitions based on biological processes, and a five-year tuition freeze. Universities argue that such mandates threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based competition in research. The White House claims the offer would provide preferential funding and federal partnerships, but schools emphasize that tying research support to political ideology undermines innovation and free inquiry. The proposal also includes an annual anonymous poll to monitor compliance, raising concerns about political surveillance. As of October 20, 2025, the University of Texas at Austin remains open to dialogue, while others have firmly rejected the offer, reflecting a broader national debate over the role of government in academic governance.",
