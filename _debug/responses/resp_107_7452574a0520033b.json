It highlights that immigration from Asia and Latin America is rising, and this surge is putting pressure on immigration systems. The report claims that current practices, including detention and deportation, may violate fundamental human rights. It stresses the importance of adopting more humane policies, particularly for vulnerable populations such as unaccompanied minors and asylum seekers. Additionally, the report points out that forced labor and labor exploitation are significant concerns, especially in global supply chains where migrant workers are often used under poor conditions. The authors call for greater international cooperation to ensure that human rights are respected throughout the migration process, including in transit countries and destination countries like the United States.","tags":["human rights","immigration","asylum seekers","forced labor","labor exploitation","global supply chains","international cooperation","United States","Asia","Latin America"],"timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"Human Rights Watch Warns of Human Rights Violations in U.S. Immigration System"}
