The deal, which requires Senate approval, includes strict eligibility criteria, background checks, and Belize’s authority to approve or reject transfers.

The agreement follows a regional pattern seen in Paraguay, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras, and is part of a broader policy under President Donald Trump that emphasizes mass deportations and international transfers, supported by a recent Supreme Court decision enabling such actions without risk assessments.",
