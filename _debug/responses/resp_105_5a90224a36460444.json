    "Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, has emerged as a strong contender in the NYC mayoral race, defeating long-time Democratic establishment figure Andrew Cuomo in the primary.",
    "Mamdani’s campaign focuses on progressive policies such as freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, which appeal strongly to young voters.",

    "The race reflects a generational divide in the Democratic Party, where younger voters are increasingly disillusioned with establishment figures and favor new, authentic, and progressive voices.",
    "If Mamdani wins, he will become the first Muslim mayor of New York City, a significant milestone in a city with the largest Jewish community outside Israel.",
    "Andrew Cuomo’s political history, including his resignation in 2021 due to a sexual misconduct scandal, has contributed to his declining support among younger voters."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani's rise in the New York City mayoral race reflects a deep generational shift within the Democratic Party. As a young, progressive candidate with a strong social media presence and bold policy proposals—such as rent control and free public transit—Mamdani has outperformed the establishment figure Andrew Cuomo, who faces backlash for his past scandals and traditional campaign style. Polls show that over half of Mamdani’s support comes from young voters under age 50, while Cuomo’s base is predominantly over 50. Mamdani’s authenticity, humor, and engagement with issues like the Gaza conflict have resonated with younger demographics, even as he faces criticism over his political ideology. If elected, he would become the first Muslim mayor of New York City, marking a significant milestone in the city’s political history.",
