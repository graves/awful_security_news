  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is facing intense legal and political scrutiny over its decision to release two survivors of a failed military strike in the Caribbean — allegedly targeting drug-carrying submarines — instead of detaining them for prosecution. The release contradicts the administration’s claims that the individuals posed an imminent threat to American lives, with no public evidence provided to support such claims. Experts, including Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, have criticized the administration’s approach as legally questionable, noting inconsistencies in claims about war powers, drug trafficking, and due process. International leaders such as Colombian President Gustavo Petro have challenged the narrative, calling the victims 'fishermen' with no ties to drugs. The lack of transparency in legal justifications and the avoidance of civil prosecution or Guantanamo detention suggest an effort to sidestep accountability. This has led to growing bipartisan concern within Congress, including from Republican senators like Todd Young, who have questioned the legality of the strikes and the absence of congressional approval. The situation has drawn renewed attention to the broader issues of executive overreach, due process, and international diplomacy in U.S. foreign policy.",
