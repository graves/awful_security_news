Her political career includes key roles such as minister of international communications, and she has drawn comparisons to Margaret Thatcher for her strong, decisive leadership. However, Takaichi holds traditional gender views, opposes same-sex marriage, supports male-only succession to the throne, and has stirred controversy by downplaying Japanâ€™s wartime aggression and visiting the Yasukuni Shrine. She advocates for tighter immigration controls, including restrictions on foreign property purchases and anti-espionage laws targeting Chinese residents. Despite promising to increase gender parity in her cabinet to Nordic levels, she appointed only two women. Takaichi has also expressed strong friendliness toward U.S. President Donald Trump, indicating a shared conservative ideology and potential for diplomatic collaboration. Her ascension marks a historic milestone in Japan's political history, especially given the country's long-standing gender imbalance in parliament and its shift toward more right-wing policies.",
