    "Iceland, long known for its cold climate and mosquito-free status, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes — three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species — found in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík.",
    "The discovery was made by Björn Hjaltason, who observed and collected a suspicious fly at dusk on October 16, 2025, and reported it to entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson.",
    "Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed the identification of the mosquitoes as Culiseta annulata, a species native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates, capable of surviving winter in sheltered environments.",
    "This marks the first known record of mosquitoes inhabiting Iceland’s natural environment, unlike a single previous finding on an airplane at Keflavík International Airport.",
    "Theories for the mosquito’s arrival include transport via ships or containers, with ongoing monitoring needed to assess whether the species can survive the winter and establish itself permanently.",
    "Climate change is a contributing factor in the potential expansion of mosquito habitats globally, and Iceland has already experienced record-breaking heat due to warming trends.",
    "Experts remain cautious about directly linking the discovery to climate change, noting that mosquitoes have previously been found in northern Scandinavia, and the full impact of warming on mosquito range remains uncertain.",
    "The discovery is significant as it highlights how global warming may allow disease-carrying insects to expand into previously inhospitable regions, posing new public health and ecological challenges."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long considered free of wild mosquitoes due to its harsh, cold climate, has officially recorded its first confirmed natural occurrence of mosquitoes — three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species — discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík. The discovery, made by citizen scientist Björn Hjaltason on October 16, 2025, was verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, who identified the species as cold-adapted and capable of surviving winter in sheltered environments. While the exact mechanism of arrival remains uncertain — possibly via ships or containers — the event underscores a broader ecological shift. Experts debate whether climate change directly caused this discovery, noting that mosquitoes have previously been found in northern Scandinavia and that warming may increase the potential for future mosquito colonization. This finding is significant not only for Iceland but as a global indicator of how rising temperatures are expanding mosquito habitats, potentially increasing the spread of diseases in previously unaffected regions.",
