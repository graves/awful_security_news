  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "City health officials, through the Big Cities Health Coalition, are urging widespread vaccination to counter misinformation and declining trust in federal public health guidance. The coalition, composed of public health leaders from major U.S. cities, criticizes the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for recent changes in vaccine recommendations—such as withdrawing support for the MMRV vaccine—and for being influenced by political ideology rather than science. They cite President Donald Trump's false claims about vaccine safety, declining public trust in the CDC (with only half of Americans now trusting it), and real-world outbreaks like a measles outbreak in South Carolina involving over 100 unvaccinated students. Experts stress that public health decisions must rely on data and science, not political bias, and that local systems must collaborate across jurisdictions to protect communities in an era of fragmented federal leadership.",
