  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays have advanced to the World Series for the first time in over 30 years after defeating the Seattle Mariners in a seven-game ALCS, marking a significant turnaround from their 2024 performance. The opposing team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, are the most successful franchise in recent years with two World Series titles and five NL pennants, having swept the Milwaukee Brewers and narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the postseason. The Dodgers’ postseason dominance is highlighted by Shohei Ohtani's legendary performance in Game 4 of the NLCS, where he delivered three home runs and a 6.1 shutout innings. Despite being the favorites, the Dodgers face a defensive and bullpen challenge, while the Blue Jays' success in the ALCS — including a 34-run explosion against the Yankees — suggests a strong team dynamic. The World Series begins on Friday, October 24, in Toronto, making this a pivotal moment in MLB history.",
