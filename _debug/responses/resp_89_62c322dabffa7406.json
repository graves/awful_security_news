  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears in the Myoko woods in Japan during a routine run in early October 2025. The bear attacked him, biting off a chunk of bone from his arm and injuring his leg, leading to three surgeries, including a hip graft and metal plate insertion. This incident is part of a rising trend of bear attacks in Japan, with over 100 injuries and seven deaths reported in 2025 — the highest since 2006 — driven by climate change disrupting bear food sources and forcing them into human areas. The Japanese government has responded by announcing stricter measures to control bear populations. Halloran, though traumatized, remains determined to return to nature and running, supported by the local runner community. He now advocates for personal precautions like bear spray, acknowledging the increasing danger posed by climate-driven wildlife behavior.",
