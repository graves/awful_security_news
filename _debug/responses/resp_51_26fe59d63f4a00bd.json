These actions are politically and militarily risky, with growing evidence that they may be based on unverified claims about drug trafficking. Despite some public support for military action to combat drug flows, polling data indicates strong opposition to unilateral interventions, especially without allied consent. The sudden retirement of Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of U.S. Southern Command, suggests internal military concern over the administration’s escalation tactics. Overall, the article warns that such actions reflect a shift toward militarized assertiveness under Trump, potentially facing significant public and political backlash.",
