  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a survivor of a US military strike on a semi-submersible vessel allegedly used for drug smuggling in the Caribbean. The vessel, reportedly carrying fentanyl, was attacked in September 2025, resulting in at least 32 deaths and two survivors—Tufiño (Ecuadorian) and Jeison Obando Pérez (Colombian)—who were repatriated. Tufiño was not detained due to the absence of criminal evidence in Ecuador, while Obando Pérez arrived in Colombia with a severe traumatic brain injury. US President Donald Trump justified the strikes by claiming the vessel was a drug-carrying submarine operated by 'narco-terrorists' linked to Venezuela's Cartel of the Suns, though experts question the legality of the attacks under international law. The operation, involving around 10,000 US troops and numerous military assets, has triggered diplomatic tensions, especially with Colombia and Venezuela, where accusations of sovereignty violations and drug trafficking are in conflict. Despite regional support from nations like Trinidad and Tobago, the campaign remains controversial due to its potential breach of international norms and the high civilian casualty toll.",
