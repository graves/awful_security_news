    "The GOP, including President Donald Trump and key figures such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, has launched a campaign of exaggerated and baseless rhetoric claiming that 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists.",
    "Despite judicial rulings and data showing that left-wing violence has not surpassed decades of right-wing violence, the GOP has intensified its narrative about the left being dangerously violent.",
    "The rhetoric is strategically suspect and inconsistent with past Republican criticisms of broad generalizations, such as those used against Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.",
    "Historical evidence from June rallies shows the events were largely peaceful, with only a few alleged incidents, some of which involved counter-protesters or a deadly shooting by a peacekeeper who feared a mass shooting.",
    "Democratic leaders like California Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Ruben Gallego have responded by emphasizing the need for peace and cautioning against narratives that could justify militarization of the homeland.",
    "Public opinion polls show an even split on whether left- or right-wing violence is worse, and a majority of Americans now view the Republican Party as more extreme than the Democratic Party.",

Despite judicial rulings and data showing that left-wing violence remains minimal compared to historical right-wing violence, the GOP continues to promote a narrative of extreme left-wing danger. Evidence from previous June rallies, including peaceful scenes and limited incidents involving counter-protesters or a deadly peacekeeper shooting, contradicts these claims. Democratic leaders such as Gavin Newsom and Ruben Gallego have responded by urging peaceful conduct to counter the narrative. Public polling shows no clear consensus that left-wing violence is greater than right-wing violence, and a majority of Americans view the Republican Party as more extreme. This rhetoric risks enabling militarization and authoritarian responses to political dissent, raising serious concerns about democratic integrity and civil liberties.",
