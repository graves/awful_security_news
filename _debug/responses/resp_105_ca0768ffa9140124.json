  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins has publicly requested that President Donald Trump remove his performance of 'Danger Zone' from an AI-generated video posted on Truth Social, which depicts Trump in a fighter jet wearing a crown and dumping sludge over protesters in Times Square. The video, created as a response to the 'No Kings' protests, features the song from the 1986 film 'Top Gun,' which was composed by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock and performed by Loggins. While such use of music in political content is generally legal with proper compensation, Loggins argues that the use of his song in a divisive context is inappropriate and undermines national unity. The White House has not responded directly, instead sharing a 'Top Gun' film still. This incident follows a broader pattern of musicians and their estates filing copyright lawsuits against Trump, including The White Stripes and Isaac Hayes’ estate, highlighting ongoing tensions over the political appropriation of music.",
