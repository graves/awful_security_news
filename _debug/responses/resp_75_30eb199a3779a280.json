  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, which was viewed as a major diplomatic victory, President Donald Trump has not seen a significant boost in public approval. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC show that while support for Trump on the Gaza issue increased slightly, overall disapproval remains high, with his approval rating on the economy at a historic low. Americans are more concerned about inflation, the cost of living, and job security than foreign policy, and only 4% rank international events as the top national issue. The fragility of previous ceasefire agreements, combined with deteriorating economic sentiment, suggests that the public sees little lasting benefit from the Gaza deal. This reflects a broader trend where economic performance outweighs foreign policy outcomes in shaping public opinion.",
