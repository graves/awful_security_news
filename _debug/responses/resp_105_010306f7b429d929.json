  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan's parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister on October 21, 2025, following the resignation of Shigeru Ishiba after a year in office and a failed election. Takaichi, a long-time LDP figure and protégé of Shinzo Abe, won 237 votes against 149 for opposition leader Yoshikoko Noda, securing her position through a coalition with the rightwing Japan Innovation Party. This alliance, lacking a majority in both houses, raises concerns about governmental stability and legislative effectiveness. Takaichi’s leadership is expected to follow Abe’s policies, including military expansion, constitutional revision, and support for imperial family male-only succession. She opposes same-sex marriage and has faced diplomatic criticism from China and South Korea over her visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. Despite toning down some rhetoric, her government faces significant challenges in economic recovery, policy legitimacy, and coalition management.",
