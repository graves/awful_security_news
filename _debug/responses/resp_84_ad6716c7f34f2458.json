  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, has challenged proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products, arguing that claims linking its use during pregnancy to autism or ADHD are unsupported by science. The proposed labeling changes originated from statements by former President Donald Trump and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suggested that acetaminophen use increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. However, multiple peer-reviewed studies—including one involving over 2 million children—have found no significant association between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD. The FDA maintains that no clear causal link exists and has not updated its official guidance. Regulatory bodies in the EU, UK, and Canada affirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Kenvue has formally requested the FDA to deny a citizen petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network, emphasizing that such label changes would be arbitrary and contrary to scientific evidence.",
