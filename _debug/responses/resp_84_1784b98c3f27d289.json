  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Trump administration officials are quietly discussing the possibility of a meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Trump’s upcoming Asia trip in October 2025, although no serious logistical planning has been done. While Trump has publicly expressed interest and Kim has previously signaled openness, there has been no communication between Washington and Pyongyang. The idea was first raised during a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, who suggested the APEC gathering in South Korea as a potential venue. The 2019 Panmunjom handshake summit, initiated by a tweet and facilitated through a U.S. military officer using a bullhorn and the DMZ hotline, serves as a precedent. However, current discussions lack prior contact, and South Korea has not initiated any talks with North Korea. The White House has instead prioritized a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping due to rising trade tensions. With no formal agreements or active planning, the likelihood of a meeting remains speculative and uncertain.",
