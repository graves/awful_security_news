  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins has requested that President Donald Trump remove the use of his performance of 'Danger Zone' from an AI-generated video posted on Truth Social. The video, depicting Trump in a fighter jet labeled 'KING TRUMP' dumping sludge over protest crowds in Times Square, was created in response to widespread 'No Kings' protests. Loggins claims the use of his song is unauthorized and harmful, as it promotes division rather than unity. While such use of copyrighted music is generally legal with proper licensing, performers can prohibit specific uses, especially in political contexts. This incident follows a history of artist lawsuits against Trump, including those by The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, with the Hayes case still ongoing. The White House did not respond directly to Logginsâ€™ request, instead sharing a promotional image from the film 'Top Gun'.",
