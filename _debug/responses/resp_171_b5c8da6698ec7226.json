  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he is willing to participate in a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, provided it is structured as shuttle diplomacy. Zelenskyy expresses concerns over Hungary’s close ties with Russia and its hostility toward Ukraine, especially given Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s alignment with Moscow. The summit, set for the coming weeks, is viewed as a potential turning point in peace efforts, though it faces strong criticism from EU leaders who question the legitimacy of hosting Putin in a country that has refused to allow ICC enforcement. Trump has shifted between offering military aid and advocating for a front-line freeze, while Russia claims Ukraine's inconsistent signals are undermining peace talks. The Budapest summit remains controversial due to the ICC’s arrest warrant for Putin and Hungary's decision to shield him from legal accountability.",
