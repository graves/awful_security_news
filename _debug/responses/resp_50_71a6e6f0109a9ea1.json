  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As artificial intelligence drives unprecedented demand for data centers, companies and researchers are exploring space-based computing as a sustainable alternative to terrestrial infrastructure. This approach seeks to bypass land and energy constraints by leveraging continuous solar energy in space, with projects like ASCEND in Europe and startups such as Madari Space, Lonestar Data Holdings, and Starcloud conducting technical demonstrations. While advocates argue that space-based data centers offer environmental benefits and technological resilience, experts remain skeptical due to high costs, radiation risks, heat dissipation challenges, and the threat of space debris. Despite early experiments and planned launches—such as Lonestar’s moon-based system in 2027 and Starcloud’s H100-powered satellite—the technology remains in early development, with significant engineering and economic hurdles to overcome before becoming viable at scale.",
