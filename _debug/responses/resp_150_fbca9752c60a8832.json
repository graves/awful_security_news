  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Colombian appeals court has overturned the conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe on fraud and bribery charges, citing structural flaws in the original ruling. This marks the first time a former Colombian president has been convicted of a crime. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, was accused of conspiring with paramilitary members to manipulate witness testimony, a claim he denied. The decision has intensified political polarization, with critics like President Gustavo Petro accusing the judiciary of covering up paramilitary abuses. Senator Ivan Cepeda has announced plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. The case has drawn international attention, particularly from U.S. officials, including Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, who have criticized Colombia’s judicial system as biased. The outcome has significant implications for Colombia’s 2026 presidential election, where political dynamics may shift based on the evolving legal status of Uribe and the potential for broader political realignments.",
