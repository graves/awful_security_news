    "Enshittification is a term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe the degradation of internet platforms over time, where they shift from user-friendly services to exploitative, profit-driven models.",
    "The process occurs in three stages: Stage 1 (user acquisition), Stage 2 (business customer favoring), and Stage 3 (profit extraction at user and business expense).",
    "Doctorow argues that platforms exploit network effects and high switching costs to lock in users and businesses, making it difficult for users to exit the platforms.",
    "In Stage 3, platforms impose junk fees on Amazon sellers (up to 51 cents per dollar earned), manipulate search algorithms, and prioritize paid content over user preferences.",
    "Doctorow identifies a lack of competition and weak consumer regulation as core reasons platforms degrade, calling for stronger antitrust enforcement and the 'right to exit' policies.",
    "Interoperability is proposed as a solution to break down artificial barriers, such as those preventing Android apps on iPhones or cross-platform messaging between Bluesky and Twitter.",
    "Amazon and Facebook deny Doctorow's claims, with Amazon asserting that its services have improved and that its fees are optional and not junk fees.",
    "The theory challenges the prevailing 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law, advocating for a shift to policies that prioritize user fairness and platform accountability."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow, an internet activist and journalist, introduces and explains the concept of 'enshittification' — a term describing how internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade over time from user-friendly services to exploitative, profit-driven systems. He outlines a three-stage model: in Stage 1, platforms attract users with generous deals and network effects; in Stage 2, they prioritize business customers, leading to data harvesting and content manipulation; and in Stage 3, they extract maximum profit through junk fees, algorithmic manipulation, and user exploitation. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak regulatory oversight, particularly the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. He proposes solutions like a 'right to exit' policy and greater interoperability to restore user control and fairness. While Amazon and Facebook deny these claims, Doctorow cites research and real-world evidence to support his argument, emphasizing that enshittification represents a broader systemic failure in how technology platforms are governed and valued.",
