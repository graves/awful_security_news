  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is facing mounting legal and political criticism for its military strikes in the Caribbean targeting alleged drug-carrying submarines, with a recent failed strike resulting in the release of two survivors from Colombia and Ecuador. This action contradicts the administration’s claim that these individuals are 'narco-terrorists' posing an imminent threat to American lives, as no public evidence supports such claims. Legal experts, including Jack Goldsmith, argue that releasing the men instead of detaining them indicates a lack of legal justification and a deliberate avoidance of due process. The administration’s failure to disclose evidence and its decision to release survivors to their home countries—while claiming war-like powers—raises serious concerns about transparency, legality, and accountability. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and U.S. lawmakers like Senator Todd Young, challenge the legitimacy of the operations, citing no drug trafficking links and the absence of congressional approval. Despite growing bipartisan concern, Congress has so far remained passive, likely due to political dynamics and the ongoing government shutdown, though recent votes and statements suggest increasing scrutiny may intensify.",
