  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to administer the oath of office to newly elected Arizona congresswoman Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025. Johnson claims he is following the precedent set by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, delaying swearing-in until the House returns from recess. However, the lawsuit argues that the U.S. Constitution does not grant the Speaker the authority to block the swearing-in of a duly elected member, especially when no valid reason is given. The lawsuit further alleges that Johnson’s delay is politically motivated—aimed at blocking a petition to release Jeffrey Epstein-related records and to strengthen his position in budget negotiations. The case underscores a constitutional question about the role of the Speaker in seating newly elected members and the balance between political discretion and constitutional obligations. Grijalva has not spoken to Johnson since her election and is attempting to meet with him to resolve the impasse.",
