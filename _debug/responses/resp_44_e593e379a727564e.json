  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 20-year-old singer known as Sombr, whose viral music singles 'Back to Friends' and 'Undressed' boosted his popularity on TikTok, faced backlash after a 25-year-old fan named Meg posted a scathing review of his concert at The Anthem in Washington, DC. Meg described the event as one of the worst experiences of her life due to an overwhelmingly young audience, immature humor, and inappropriate jokes, including references to niche memes and a 'dating show' bit where fans were asked to call their 'toxic exes.' In response, Sombr labeled the situation as 'TikTok drama,' defended his lighthearted, joke-heavy performance style, and emphasized that only five minutes of the show included humor, with the rest being music. He also used the phrase 'touch grass' as a social media gesture to promote a youthful, carefree lifestyle. Meg noted that she has not received such intense backlash before, suggesting the public reaction was disproportionate, and the incident highlights the tension between emerging artists and audience expectations regarding age-appropriateness and content tone.",
