  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, especially in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, targeting facilities on 15 separate days over the past month. These attacks, including strikes on Novhorod-Siverskyi that killed four civilians, are described as a deliberate tactic to inflict suffering and prolong the humanitarian crisis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes the strategy to 'killing people and terrorizing them with cold,' and highlights the growing threat from drones that circle damaged sites, making repairs unsafe. In response, Ukraine is seeking increased European support, including financial aid from frozen Russian assets and military equipment such as Patriot air defense systems. Zelensky has also turned to European leaders to discuss coordinated responses and the use of Russia’s immobilized assets, while expressing deep skepticism about a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban. Analyst Tatiana Stanovaya notes a recurring pattern: when U.S. President Donald Trump expresses frustration with Russia, Moscow intensifies its military actions, suggesting a cyclical dynamic of diplomatic pressure and escalation.",
