  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of workers are facing financial obligations upon leaving jobs due to 'stay-or-pay' agreements, which require repayment of benefits like training or signing bonuses if they leave before a set retention period. While employers argue this recoups investment, critics label such practices — especially training repayment agreements (TRAPs) — as abusive and restrictive of worker mobility, particularly for lower-income workers in industries like healthcare, transportation, and retail. A landmark California law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom and set to take effect on January 1, 2026, bans repayment for on-the-job training (except in approved apprentice programs) and for benefits when employees are laid off without cause. The law still allows limited stay-or-pay provisions for bonuses and tuition reimbursement, with prorated repayment and a two-year maximum stay period. This move is seen as a significant step toward protecting worker autonomy, with support from groups like the California Nurses Association. Similar efforts are underway in other states, such as New York, suggesting a potential national shift in labor policy.",
