  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, the body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri was identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned from Gaza by Hamas, with the other body being that of Israeli citizen Ronen Engel. The return of these bodies occurred amid ongoing tensions over the ceasefire, which has been strained by delays in recovering remaining hostage remains, continued Israeli military strikes, and accusations from both sides of violations. Hamas claims it has handed over all accessible bodies, while Israel alleges it knows the locations of missing bodies and is using them as leverage. The Rafah crossing remains closed, with both sides citing compliance and non-compliance issues. Protests erupted in Israel over the slow recovery, and the U.S. warned of an imminent Hamas ceasefire violation. The article underscores the humanitarian, political, and diplomatic dimensions of the hostage crisis, emphasizing the personal tragedies, international involvement, and fragile state of the ceasefire agreement.",
