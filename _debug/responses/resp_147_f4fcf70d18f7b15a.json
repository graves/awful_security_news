  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), part of the United Nations, has released a report urging global action to close critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather. Despite progress in some regions, nearly half of all countries lack adequate systems, with disaster-related deaths six times higher in nations without them—most of which occur in developing countries. The article highlights real-world cases, including floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US, as well as a successful evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten due to a predicted glacier collapse in May 2025. Experts stress that early warnings not only save lives but also protect vital infrastructure and economic assets, especially as climate change intensifies weather extremes and permafrost melt threatens further instability.",
