  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump did not rule out sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, despite Putin’s opposition. Trump expressed the idea of supplying the missiles to Ukraine’s opposition as a tool of leverage, which could pressure Putin to negotiate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has long viewed the weapons as a potential game-changer in the war, hoping they would force a peace settlement. However, the US administration has not committed to the deployment, and officials note that Trump can reverse the decision at any time. Putin argued that such a move would damage US-Russian relations and threaten major Russian cities, while US officials see the threat as a strategic diplomatic tool rather than an immediate escalation. A proposed meeting in Budapest between Trump and Putin may have delayed a resolution, but the broader context of US diplomatic success in the Middle East underscores Trump’s focus on peace through negotiation.",
