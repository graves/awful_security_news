  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 necessary appropriations bills, marking a significant escalation from the 2018 partial shutdown that lasted 35 days and is the longest in history. That 2018 shutdown, which began on December 22, 2018, and ended on January 25, 2019, cost the economy an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and affected approximately 800,000 federal employees, with 300,000 furloughed and others exempted from work. The current shutdown is more severe as it affects all federal operations, unlike the 2018 situation. Political challenges, including a narrow House majority and inability to overcome Senate filibusters, have made legislative compromise difficult. The article underscores how deep political polarization and procedural barriers contribute to prolonged government shutdowns, with implications for economic stability, public services, and national governance.",
