  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024. The attack, which occurred during a public event in Handlova, left Fico seriously injured. The court determined that the act constituted terrorism due to its targeted nature against a political leader, despite Cintula’s claim that he intended only to hurt Fico and not kill him. The verdict reflects deep political and societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico's government facing criticism for policy shifts, including ending military aid to Ukraine, strengthening ties with Russia, and reforming public media. The opposition argues these changes undermine democratic standards and media freedom. Cintula claims his actions were a response to policies he believes have harmed Slovak culture and freedom, and he has stated he will appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust'. Fico, who has forgiven Cintula, has returned to public office and continues to lead Slovakia's political landscape amid ongoing controversy.",
