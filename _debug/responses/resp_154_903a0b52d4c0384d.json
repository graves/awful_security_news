    "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in October 2025 that children circumcised early have double the rate of autism, citing two studies — one from 2013 and one from 2015 — and linking it to acetaminophen use.",
    "Neither the 2013 nor the 2015 study established a causal link between circumcision or acetaminophen and autism. Both found only correlations, not causations, and had significant limitations including small sample sizes and lack of data on acetaminophen use.",
    "The 2015 Danish study found a 46–62% increased autism risk in circumcised boys, but this was based on a small subset (only 57 boys with both conditions), and the results were criticized for methodological flaws.",
    "The 2025 WPLab preprint, which is not peer-reviewed, claims that acetaminophen exposure 'triggers many if not most cases of autism' and is cited by Kennedy, despite contradicting scientific consensus and lacking empirical support.",
    "Mainstream science and experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, emphasize that correlation does not imply causation and that no credible research shows that acetaminophen causes autism in children.",
    "Acetaminophen is considered safe for infants when used appropriately under medical supervision, and decades of research do not support a link to increased autism risk."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made claims in October 2025 linking early circumcision to increased autism rates, citing two studies — a 2013 cross-national analysis and a 2015 Danish study — and falsely associating the link with acetaminophen use. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, have thoroughly debunked these claims, noting that both studies only show weak, correlational associations and lack data on acetaminophen exposure or causality. The 2015 study, in particular, was criticized for small sample sizes and methodological flaws. A 2025 preprint by WPLab, an organization promoting the acetaminophen-autism link, was cited by Kennedy but remains unpeer-reviewed and unsupported by scientific consensus. Experts emphasize that decades of research show acetaminophen is safe for infants when used properly, and no credible evidence links it to increased autism risk. The false claims are seen as part of a broader narrative that misrepresents science and undermines public health guidance.",
