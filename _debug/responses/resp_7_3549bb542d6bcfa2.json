  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown, many national parks remain open despite the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees, leading to safety concerns, unregulated access, and environmental degradation. While some businesses report no immediate losses, others face significant economic impacts. Tourists continue to visit parks like Grand Canyon and Yosemite, but increased illegal activities—including drone flights and base jumping—have been reported, prompting advocacy groups to call for park closures. In contrast, private museums in Washington, D.C., such as Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum, have seen surges in visitors, suggesting a shift in tourist behavior. West Virginia’s decision to keep its national parks open through October 18 for Bridge Day underscores the economic importance of tourism, while groups like the National Parks Conservation Association warn that limited staffing jeopardizes visitor safety, emergency response, and environmental integrity. The article highlights both the resilience of certain tourism sectors and the long-term economic and safety risks posed by the ongoing shutdown.",
