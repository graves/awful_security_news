  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a meticulously planned seven-minute heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, thieves stole eight of nine high-value artifacts from the French Crown Jewels, including a tiara, necklace, and brooches from queens Marie-Amélie and Eugénie, using an angle grinder to break a window in the Apollo Gallery. The robbery, which occurred at 9:30 a.m. during the museum's opening, involved four unarmed perpetrators who threatened guards and fled on motorcycles. One item, Empress Eugénie’s crown, was damaged. Security personnel thwarted an attempt to set fire to a truck used in the raid. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and Culture Minister Rachida Dati, emphasized the cultural and historical importance of the stolen items and vowed to recover them. A formal investigation into aggravated theft and criminal conspiracy is underway, with authorities considering foreign involvement. Experts warn of possible destruction of stolen items, and the museum remains closed temporarily for security. This is the first known robbery at the Louvre in over a century, drawing parallels to the 1911 Mona Lisa theft.",
