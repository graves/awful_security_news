    "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican mayoral candidate in New York City, is under pressure to drop out of the race from his boss, John Catsimatidis, who owns WABC radio and publicly urges him to withdraw, citing a need for Sliwa to 'love New York more than anything else.'",
    "Sliwa's campaign has gained momentum following a strong performance in a recent debate, and he has rejected claims that he lacks viability, directly challenging Andrew Cuomo’s assertion that he is not a viable alternative to Zohran Mamdani.",
    "Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is attempting to consolidate Republican opposition to Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani by urging Sliwa to withdraw, framing Sliwa as a weak or unviable candidate.",
    "Sliwa has dismissed accusations that he is not a real alternative, arguing that billionaire donors are using their influence to shape the race, and emphasizing his representation of blue-collar working-class New Yorkers.",
    "President Donald Trump has dismissed Sliwa as 'not exactly primetime,' mocking his affinity for cats and animal rescues, showing a broader political skepticism toward Sliwa’s candidacy.",
    "Despite criticism from both Cuomo and Trump, Sliwa remains active and defiant, with allies like Mamdani suggesting they share a common goal: resisting top-down control of the mayoral race by wealthy donors.",
    "The political dynamics reveal a fragmented Republican effort, with internal disagreements and alliances shifting, and Sliwa positioning himself as a grassroots, alternative figure in contrast to elite-backed candidates."
