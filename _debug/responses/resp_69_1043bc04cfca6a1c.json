The judge, an Obama appointee, required body-worn cameras and transparency in crowd control tactics, but reports of tear gas use without warning have prompted her to demand accountability from officials such as Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino. Despite the Trump administration’s denials and claims of compliance, officials like Kyle Harvick and Shawn Byers testified, with Harvick affirming camera use and Byers stating no disciplinary actions have occurred. The protests continue, with over 30 arrests reported, and the judge has indicated she will require further testimony if officials fail to provide clear, verifiable answers.",
