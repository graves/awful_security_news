  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 and convicted of fraud and identity theft, including stealing identities of 11 people and misusing campaign funds. Santos, who served time in a New Jersey jail, was released immediately after Trump's announcement, citing that Santos had 'courage, conviction, and intelligence' to always vote Republican, while criticizing Senator Richard Blumenthal for allegedly fabricating his military service. The commutation does not erase Santos' criminal convictions, only removes the remaining sentence. Santos had previously been exposed by a New York Times investigation in 2022, and his case remains one of the most significant congressional expulsions in over two decades, raising broader questions about accountability, executive power, and political justice.",
