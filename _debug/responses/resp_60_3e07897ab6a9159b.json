The decision, made in consultation with King Charles and Prince William, reflects growing pressure from the public and media, especially after Virginia Giuffre’s allegations of abuse at Epstein’s properties and in London. Though Andrew denies all claims, he has been stripped of military and charitable roles, and will no longer attend royal events. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will now be referred to without a title, while his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, remain unaffected. The controversy intensified after Epstein's 2019 death and has continued through legal proceedings, court rulings on Yang Tengbo, and Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which is expected to further shape public perception of the events.",
