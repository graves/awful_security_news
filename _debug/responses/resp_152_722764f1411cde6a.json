  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year prison sentence at La Sante prison in Paris after being convicted of criminal conspiracy for accepting illegal payments from Libyaâ€™s Muammar Gaddafi to fund his 2007 election campaign. Despite always denying the charges, the presiding judge, Nathalie Gavarino, described the offences as of 'exceptional gravity' and upheld the prison term even with a pending appeal. Sarkozy, the first former head of a European Union state to be imprisoned, is currently held in solitary confinement, with limited interaction and one daily walk. His lawyers have filed a release appeal, which the court will review in two months. The case has sparked public outrage and solidarity from supporters, who view the imprisonment as a threat to democracy. The incident also marks a historic moment, as Sarkozy becomes the first French leader since Nazi collaborator Philippe Petain to be imprisoned.",
