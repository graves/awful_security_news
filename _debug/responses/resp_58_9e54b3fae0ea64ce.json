  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A powerful storm, described as having the intensity of a Category 2 hurricane and named Typhoon Halong, caused catastrophic flooding in remote Alaskan villages such as Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, destroying up to 90% of homes in Kipnuk and leaving over one-third of homes uninhabitable in Kwigillingok. The storm resulted in one death, two people missing, and the displacement of over 2,000 residents, many of whom have been evacuated by military planes to Anchorage. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to secure federal aid for emergency and long-term recovery, including housing and infrastructure. Evacuees like Alexie Stone are beginning a new life in Anchorage, adjusting to a vastly different lifestyle, while local leaders emphasize the importance of community solidarity and shared identity across the state’s vast and isolated regions. Given the extreme damage, geographic challenges, and harsh Arctic climate, many residents expect to be unable to return to their homes for at least 18 months.",
