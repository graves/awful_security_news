    "Two new species — a semi-transparent porcelain crab (about 1.5cm long) and the West Australian Lantern Shark (up to 40cm long) — were discovered in the deep sea off Western Australia.",
    "The porcelain crab uses hairs to filter plankton, differing from typical crab feeding behavior that relies on claws.",
    "The West Australian Lantern Shark has large eyes and a glowing belly, found over 600 meters below sea level, and is bioluminescent due to photophores on its body.",
    "The discoveries were made during a CSIRO research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park, 20km off the coast of Western Australia.",
    "Australia is a global biodiversity hotspot with over a million species, many of which remain unstudied due to unexplored ocean regions.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO discovered two new marine species — a tiny porcelain crab (1.5cm long) using hairs to filter plankton and the West Australian Lantern Shark (up to 40cm long with a glowing belly) — during a deep-sea expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia. These discoveries, part of a larger effort to explore uncharted ocean regions, highlight Australia’s status as a global biodiversity hotspot. The research underscores the vast number of undiscovered species, with around 600 more estimated to be identified in the future due to the lengthy taxonomic process required to confirm uniqueness.",
