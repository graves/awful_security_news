    "Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists initially followed the expanded 2017 guidelines, indicating slow adoption due to confusion and uncertainty.",

    "Current guidance (updated in 2021) recommends introducing peanuts and other allergens between 4 and 6 months of age, without prior testing, and with small amounts of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurt, or tree nut butters as safe options.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after a landmark study showed that introducing peanut products to infants as early as 4 months reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms that this public health strategy has led to a measurable decline in allergy rates. Since 2015, peanut allergy rates in children under 3 have dropped by over 27%, and by over 40% after expanded guidelines in 2017. The research, led by Dr. David Hill and based on electronic health records, shows that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since the guidelines were adopted. The key scientific foundation comes from the LEAP trial by Gideon Lack at King’s College London, which demonstrated over an 80% reduction in allergy risk through early exposure. Despite initial slow adoption due to confusion among medical professionals, the strategy is now being widely implemented, with current guidelines (updated in 2021) recommending early, safe exposure to allergens like peanuts, milk, and tree nuts. Advocacy groups like FARE support this shift as a major step toward reducing food allergy prevalence.",
