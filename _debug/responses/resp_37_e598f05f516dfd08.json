  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the wake of President Donald Trump’s influence, Republican-controlled legislatures across multiple states are redrawing congressional district boundaries to gain additional seats in the 2026 midterms. North Carolina is the latest state to adopt a new map that shifts Don Davis’s competitive district to favor Republicans, increasing GOP representation to 11 out of 14 seats. This effort is part of a broader national political arms race, with Texas and Missouri also implementing redistricting plans and facing legal challenges. California is responding with a massive campaign to create new Democratic seats. Democrats are uniting across states to resist through lawsuits, protests, and voter referendums, arguing that Republican gerrymandering is a deliberate effort to preserve political power and ensure Trump’s re-election. The article highlights the growing tension between partisan control of redistricting and democratic accountability, with key figures like Hakeem Jeffries and John Bisognano leading the Democratic response.",
