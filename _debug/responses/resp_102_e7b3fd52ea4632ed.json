  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has been the target of multiple high-profile thefts over the past century, beginning with the 1911 heist of the Mona Lisa by Vincenzo Peruggia, which elevated the painting to global fame. Other notable incidents include the 1976 theft of the diamond-studded sword of King Charles X, the 1990 daylight theft of Renoir’s Portrait of a Seated Woman, and the 1998 disappearance of a Corot landscape. Despite institutional efforts to improve security, including a $1.8 million budget increase in the 1990s and a major renovation plan announced in 2024, the Louvre continues to face significant vulnerabilities due to overcrowding, outdated infrastructure, and climate instability. In October 2025, a new heist occurred in broad daylight, with masked thieves using a truck-mounted lift to break into the Galerie d'Apollon, stealing eight items of immense cultural value. The incident, which closely mirrored the 1976 theft in method and location, has intensified public and political scrutiny, leading Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin to blame institutional failures in security and infrastructure. The event underscores ongoing challenges in preserving priceless artworks in a globally accessible, yet structurally and logistically vulnerable, museum environment.",
