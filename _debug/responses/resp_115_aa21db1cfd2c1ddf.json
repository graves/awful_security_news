  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) have been found to modify their nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants exhibit self-isolation and shift social behavior — such as healthy nurses distancing themselves from foragers — resembling proactive social distancing. Researchers Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie used CT scans to observe that infected colonies develop more compartmentalized nests with reduced tunnel connectivity, farther spaced entrances, and longer travel paths. These structural changes reduce disease transmission and work in tandem with social behaviors to protect vulnerable colony members. The study, published in the journal Science, represents the first demonstration of a non-human social species actively altering its environment in response to disease threats. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest that these findings could inspire new approaches to human public space design, promoting 'architectural immunity' to help prevent disease spread.",
