  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Israeli government has identified the remains of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli military official killed on October 7, 2023, during a Hamas-led attack on a kibbutz, as belonging to a deceased hostage. His body, retrieved by the Red Cross in Gaza and transferred to Israeli forces, was officially identified on October 20, 2025, marking him as the 13th deceased hostage to be returned under the US-proposed ceasefire deal signed on October 9, 2025. The return comes amid growing frustration and diplomatic tension over Hamas's inability to locate and return all deceased hostages, with Israeli intelligence suggesting destruction in Gaza makes this difficult. One previously handed-over body was found not to belong to an Israeli hostage, indicating potential misidentification. The Trump administration, through threats of 'eradication' of Hamas and high-level diplomatic meetings between US envoys and Israeli military leaders, continues to push for compliance with the ceasefire, including the return of all deceased hostages. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has expressed deep condolences to Haimi’s family, underscoring the emotional significance of the body’s return after over two years of uncertainty.",
