  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the use of profanity by prominent U.S. political figures, particularly President Donald Trump, during recent diplomatic encounters and press interactions. It highlights Trump’s use of the 'f-bomb' in response to Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro proposing preferential access to natural resources and in reaction to ceasefire violations between Israel and Iran. The piece also traces historical instances of profanity by other leaders, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Dick Cheney, showing that such language is not new in U.S. politics and often triggers public or political reactions. These incidents underscore how political language, especially in high-stakes diplomatic or media moments, can reflect frustration, personal tone, and broader cultural norms around political decorum.",
