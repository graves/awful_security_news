    "Coca-Cola has begun rolling out a soda made with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup in select U.S. cities and retailers.",
    "This shift was prompted by President Donald Trump's earlier advocacy for cane sugar over high-fructose corn syrup.",
    "The change aligns with Trump's criticism of high-fructose corn syrup, which has been promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.",
    "International versions of Coca-Cola already use cane sugar (e.g., in Mexico), and the company already uses cane sugar in other U.S. beverages like Simply Lemonade and Gold Peak iced tea.",
    "Despite the switch to cane sugar, health experts continue to warn that sugary sodas are unhealthy regardless of sweetener type.",
    "The move comes as Coca-Cola is expanding its portfolio of healthier options, including sugar-free sodas like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which saw a 14% global volume growth in Q3 2025 and led to a 3% stock rise.",
    "The rollout reflects broader industry trends toward healthier, more transparent ingredient sourcing, even as consumer demand for traditional sodas persists."
