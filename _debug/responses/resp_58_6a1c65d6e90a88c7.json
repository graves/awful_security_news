  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States, Daniel García-Peña, for consultations, amid escalating diplomatic tensions fueled by U.S. military actions targeting alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and accusations that President Gustavo Petro promotes drug production. This is the second such recall for Colombia this year, following a similar action in July. The U.S. under President Donald Trump has accused Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader,' threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs, and launched missile attacks on seven vessels, resulting in at least 30 deaths, with Colombia claiming some victims were Colombian citizens. These actions have intensified mutual accusations of political interference and violence, placing the relationship between the two nations at a critical juncture.",
