  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's plans for a rapid summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with officials confirming no immediate plans for a meeting. A previous phone call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was deemed productive but insufficient to justify a follow-up in-person meeting, as both sides have divergent views on ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin maintains that a summit cannot be postponed without a scheduled date, while Trump continues to push for an immediate ceasefire, citing the need to stop the war at the battle line. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes Russia’s reduced diplomatic engagement to the U.S. withholding long-range missiles, suggesting that Ukraine’s military capabilities are a key factor in Russian willingness to negotiate. Diplomats note that Lavrov is not involved in key decisions, making him a limited diplomatic representative. Future talks between Rubio and Lavrov may take place at an ASEAN-led global summit in Malaysia, though no concrete plans have been finalized. The White House reaffirms Trump's commitment to achieving peace in Ukraine through diplomacy, even as summit hopes fade.",
