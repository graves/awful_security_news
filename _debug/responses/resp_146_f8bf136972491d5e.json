  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major milestone in its space programme. The satellite, developed by SUPARCO, can detect fine material and chemical changes on Earth’s surface, enabling applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. The mission is seen as a strategic step in advancing national development goals, particularly in the context of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), where space-based data can support infrastructure planning. Two other satellites (EO-1 and KS-1) are already in orbit and operational. While full calibration of H1 may take about two months, the launch reflects a broader trend of Pakistan’s growing investment in space technology and its strategic partnership with China.",
