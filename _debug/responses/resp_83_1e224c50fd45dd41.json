This incident is part of a broader pattern of profanity use by U.S. leaders, including Joe Biden’s 2010 and 2024 remarks, Barack Obama’s 2009 comment about Kanye West, and Dick Cheney’s 2004 outburst to Senator Patrick Leahy. These examples illustrate that offensive language in public political discourse—though rare and controversial—has long been part of American political culture and has evolved in both frequency and visibility across administrations.",
