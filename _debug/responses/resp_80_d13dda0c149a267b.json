  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — typically allocated to child nutrition programs — to keep the WIC program operational, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This move follows a shift from an initial plan using Section 232 tariff revenue, and is prompted by Congress’s failure to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. While the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it expressed concerns about transparency, funding amounts, and delivery timelines. Legal experts question the administration’s authority to reallocate funds without congressional appropriation. The policy response reflects broader political tensions, with Republican leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson blaming Democrats for halting essential programs. Despite bipartisan support for WIC, advocates stress the need for sustained, long-term funding to prevent cuts and ensure access for low-income families amid rising inflation and growing enrollment.",
