  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the current state of Hamas, which, after two years of war and the loss of its top leaders, has become a 'shadow' of its former self. While it has lost key figures like Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, the group has adapted by decentralizing and recruiting new fighters. Despite international pressure—including from the US under Trump and regional actors like Egypt and Turkey—to disarm and transition to a political role, Hamas remains deeply embedded in Gaza’s security and political life. Its extensive tunnel network, which spans hundreds of miles and cost billions, continues to be a strategic asset. Experts debate its future: some believe Hamas will rebrand as a peaceful political force, while others predict continued violence and another war within five years. The article underscores the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the trauma of Gazans, and the complex geopolitical dynamics involving Israel, Iran, Qatar, and the international community. Ultimately, Hamas is not dismantled but transformed—seeking to survive through rebranding and political evolution, even as it faces immense internal and external challenges.",
