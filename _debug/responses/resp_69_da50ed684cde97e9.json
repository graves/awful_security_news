  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican mayoral candidate in New York City, is under increasing pressure from within the party to drop out, notably from his boss John Catsimatidis, who owns WABC radio and publicly urged him to step back. The pressure comes amid efforts by Republican figures, including former governor Andrew Cuomo and investor Bill Ackman, to consolidate opposition to Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani by pushing Sliwa out. Sliwa has rejected these efforts, defending his candidacy as representing working-class voters and criticizing billionaire donors and establishment politics. President Donald Trump has mocked Sliwa, calling him unimpressive and focused on cats, further signaling Republican skepticism. Despite this, Sliwa remains active in the race, and Mamdani has aligned with him to oppose elite-driven politics, creating a surprising political alliance that challenges the traditional power structures in New York’s mayoral race.",
