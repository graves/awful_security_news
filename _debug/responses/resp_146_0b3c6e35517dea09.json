  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was initially approved in April 2024. Despite broad international support from nations like China, the EU, and Britain, the vote was disrupted when Trump called the initiative a 'Global Green New Scam Tax' and urged countries to oppose it. As a result, the IMO passed a resolution to postpone adoption until late 2026, with countries like Argentina and Singapore switching their positions. Climate experts and industry leaders criticized the decision as a missed opportunity, citing the urgent need for shipping emissions to be reduced by 20% by 2030 and eliminated by 2050. The decision reflects growing political resistance to climate regulation, particularly from fossil fuel advocates, and highlights the fragility of global climate action in the face of national political agendas.",
