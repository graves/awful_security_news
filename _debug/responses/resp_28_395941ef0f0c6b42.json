  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the federal government shutdown enters its third week, over 1.4 million federal workers—including contractors and employees from agencies like the Department of Commerce and Social Security Administration—are facing financial distress due to unpaid wages. In response, a food bank event in Landover, Maryland, organized by the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries, served over 370 households—far exceeding expectations—demonstrating widespread need. Federal workers like Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams describe the sudden loss of income and the emotional shock of needing food assistance, challenging the belief that federal employment guarantees financial stability. Senator Ron Johnson has introduced a bill to pay only those who work during the shutdown, while Democrats advocate for universal payment. The event underscores both the human cost of political gridlock and the growing public demand for accountability in government operations.",
