  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for terrorism charges after he shot Prime Minister Robert Fico five times in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. The attack, which left Fico seriously injured, sparked national debate over political polarization, democratic values, and the limits of political expression. Cintula claimed his motive was to protest policies he believed damaged Slovak culture and freedom, particularly on Ukraine, media, and culture. The court determined that the attack was specifically targeted at a political leader, qualifying it as terrorism under Slovak law. Although Fico has forgiven Cintula personally, the case has highlighted deep societal divides between populist governance and liberal, pro-EU opposition forces. Cintula plans to appeal, arguing the verdict was unjust, while Fico’s broader policy shifts—such as ending military aid to Ukraine and reforming public broadcasting—have drawn criticism for undermining democratic norms.",
