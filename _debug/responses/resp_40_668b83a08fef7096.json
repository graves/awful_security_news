  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a widely reported Gaza ceasefire deal attributed to President Donald Trump, American public opinion shows little enthusiasm for the outcome. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC reveals that while Trump’s approval on the Gaza issue slightly improved, disapproval remains high, and his overall approval rating is at a second-term low. More significantly, public disapproval of Trump’s economic policies — particularly on inflation and the cost of living — has reached new lows, with widespread pessimism about wages and job security. The article concludes that Americans prioritize domestic economic concerns over foreign policy achievements, reflecting a broader trend where economic performance outweighs international diplomacy in public perception.",
