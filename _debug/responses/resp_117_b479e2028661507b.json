  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins is urging President Trump to remove the audio of his song 'Danger Zone' from an AI-generated video posted on Truth Social, which depicts Trump in a fighter jet labeled 'KING TRUMP' dumping material over protest crowds in Times Square. The video, created as a response to the 'No Kings' protests, features music from the 1986 film Top Gun, composed by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock with Loggins as the performer. Loggins argues the use of his performance is unauthorized and politically divisive, advocating for music as a unifying force. While such use is legally permissible with proper licensing, artists often publicly object to protect artistic integrity. The White House has not directly responded to the request, instead sharing a Top Gun image with a speed-themed caption. This incident follows previous copyright lawsuits by musicians like The White Stripes and Isaac Hayes' estate against Trump, highlighting broader tensions over political appropriation of music.",
