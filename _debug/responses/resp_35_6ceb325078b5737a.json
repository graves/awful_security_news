  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling allows the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, reversing one of two lower court decisions that blocked the deployment. The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, is controversial, with a dissenting judge criticizing it as unconstitutional and dangerous to state sovereignty and civil liberties. The administration argues that protests at ICE facilities threaten federal personnel and property, justifying troop use under the Insurrection Act. However, state officials, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and California Governor Gavin Newsom, challenge the deployment as illegal, overreaching, and harmful to public safety and civil rights. Legal challenges continue in Chicago and Memphis, where local officials argue the deployment violates state law and fails to meet constitutional or statutory thresholds. The broader issue reflects a national debate over presidential power, military involvement in civilian unrest, and the balance between federal authority and state sovereignty, with growing public and political resistance and calls for a federal inquiry into the cumulative impact of such deployments.",
