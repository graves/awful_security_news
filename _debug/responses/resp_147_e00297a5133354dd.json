  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Fengshen caused widespread flooding and landslides across the Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and two missing persons. A family of five was crushed to death in Pitogo, Quezon, when a tree fell on their bamboo house, while a teenage boy survived. Over 47,000 people evacuated to shelters, and five dams released water to manage flood risks. Heavy rains triggered a landslide in Bukidnon, Mindanao, blocking a key highway and causing a vehicle to fall off the road. Flooding also affected Samar and Panay, with one person injured in a house collapse. The event occurs amid the Philippines' ongoing recovery from a series of earthquakes, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has called for stronger disaster preparedness, citing climate change as a growing factor in extreme weather events.",
