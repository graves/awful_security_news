  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a high-profile Gaza ceasefire deal announced on October 8, 2025, Americans show little enthusiasm for President Donald Trump’s handling of the agreement. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC reveal that Trump’s overall approval rating has declined to a second-term low, with strong disapproval on economic issues, including inflation and cost of living. The article attributes this to the persistent public concern over the economy—such as declining wage expectations, rising job insecurity, and stagnant economic growth—rather than the diplomatic achievement. Foreign policy is seen as low-priority by the public, with only 4% considering international events the most important issue. The fragile nature of past peace deals, like the short-lived Biden ceasefire, further undermines trust in the current agreement. As a result, Trump’s political standing appears unchanged or worse, illustrating that domestic economic concerns dominate public sentiment over international achievements.",
