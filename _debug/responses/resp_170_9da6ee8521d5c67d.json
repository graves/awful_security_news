  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US Vice-President JD Vance arrives in Israel to support the fragile 12-day ceasefire in Gaza, which began on 10 October 2025, following a Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered Israeli air strikes. The US has deployed special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to reinforce the deal and push for negotiations on long-term peace, including an interim Palestinian government, international stabilisation force, and Hamas disarmament. Israel, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has demanded Hamas return all deceased hostages before joining peace talks, a condition Hamas has partially met—13 of 28 bodies have been returned, including that of Tal Haimi. Despite this, violence persists, with Israeli forces claiming Hamas breached the ceasefire and killing at least 45 Palestinians in response. The ceasefire remains under pressure, with Israeli officials warning it could collapse. Meanwhile, the UN's World Food Programme faces severe delivery challenges, with only two crossings—Kerem Shalom and Kissufim—functional, and the northern Gaza region experiencing extreme food shortages. Hamas chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya confirms commitment to the ceasefire and recovery efforts, though logistical difficulties remain. US President Donald Trump has vowed to 'eradicate' Hamas if it violates the deal, signaling strong US enforcement intent. The situation highlights the fragile balance between military action, humanitarian aid, and diplomatic negotiations in a region deeply affected by violence.",
