  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of AI-generated voice scams targeting wealthy individuals have emerged, particularly in Italy, where fraudulent calls mimicking Defence Minister Guido Crosetto’s voice led to a financial scam involving businessman Massimo Moratti. Research by Queen Mary University of London demonstrates that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants rating them as more trustworthy. These scams are part of a broader trend of deepfake misuse, including fake news, fraud, and the creation of sexually explicit content involving real people, including children. Global losses from such scams have surged to over $547 million by mid-2025. In response, governments like the United States and Australia have introduced new laws and bans to curb the misuse of AI-generated content, highlighting both the sophistication of current AI technology and the urgent need for ethical oversight and public awareness.",
