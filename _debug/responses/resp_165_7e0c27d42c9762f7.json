  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically short, with only 750 metric tonnes of food entering daily—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to only two border crossings being open. Despite a recent increase in distribution points to 26, the WFP stresses that full humanitarian access is blocked by political and military constraints, including the closure of the Rafah crossing and restrictions on access to key routes like Salah al-Din Street. The US-brokered ceasefire, supported by a 20-point plan, is seen as essential for enabling sustained aid and preventing famine, especially in northern Gaza. The situation has led to widespread food hoarding among Palestinians, as they remain anxious about the durability of the ceasefire and future conflict.",
