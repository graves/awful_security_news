  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central estimates that global warming, driven by climate change, will result in an additional 57 superhot days per year by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat—under current climate commitments. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 superhot days that would have occurred under a worst-case 4°C warming scenario prior to the Paris Climate Agreement. Since 2015, the planet has already added 11 such days on average. The study reveals a profound global inequality: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa—accounting for only 1% of global emissions—will face massive spikes in heat exposure, with Panama expected to gain 149 extra days, while major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts such as Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto stress that even under current efforts, the climate remains perilous for billions, and the disparity in impacts could fuel future geopolitical instability.",
