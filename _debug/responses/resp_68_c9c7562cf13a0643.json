  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A recent heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, saw thieves break into the Apollo Gallery and steal high-value jewelry, including the damaged crown of Empress Eugénie. The robbery, which occurred in just seven minutes and prompted museum closure, is part of a longer pattern of security failures linked to outdated systems and poor infrastructure. A 2019–2024 report by the Court of Auditors revealed persistent delays in upgrading the museum’s security and technical equipment, while internal warnings from Louvre President Laurence des Cars highlighted overcrowding, water leaks, and deteriorating visitor services. The theft echoes previous incidents, such as the 1911 'Mona Lisa' theft by Vincenzo Peruggia and the 1983 disappearance of 16th-century armor. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for a 10-year expansion to include a dedicated room for the 'Mona Lisa', underscoring the museum’s role as both a cultural treasure and a site of ongoing operational crisis.",
