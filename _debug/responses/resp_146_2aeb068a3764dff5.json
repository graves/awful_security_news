    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, restricting 12 out of 17 total rare-earth elements (including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium), bringing the total number of restricted elements to 12.",
    "The restrictions now include specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, which foreign companies must obtain special approvals to use.",
    "Foreign companies must justify the intended use of products made with Chinese rare-earth metals, especially if they contain at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",
    "China cites national security and threats to international peace and non-proliferation as justifications for the controls, pointing to direct or indirect transfers of controlled materials to military or sensitive applications.",
    "Rare-earth metals are critical for advanced technologies including electric vehicles, LED TVs, camera lenses, AI semiconductors, and defence systems such as F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, and drones.",

    "The move is seen as a strategic signal before a high-level Trump-Xi meeting at APEC, indicating China’s willingness to weaponize its supply chain dominance.",
    "Analysts believe this action strengthens China’s leverage in trade negotiations and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in US defence and industrial supply chains.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—adding five new metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) to previous restrictions—effective December 1, 2025. The controls apply to both raw metals and specialized refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain Beijing-approved licenses and justify the use of products with heavy rare-earth content. China cites national security and proliferation risks, particularly from foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military use. The move occurs just before a high-level Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit, signaling a strategic effort to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing US-China trade negotiations. The US, which imported $22.8 million in rare-earth products from China in 2023 and relies on these materials for defence systems (like F-35 jets and submarines) and civilian technologies (such as electric vehicles and AI), faces significant supply disruptions. Analysts view the controls as a deliberate diplomatic signal, deepening the US vulnerability in critical supply chains and reinforcing China’s dominance in this essential strategic resource.",
