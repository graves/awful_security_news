  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regions, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing animal behavior, cloud patterns, and using sound signals like gunfire—is being used by local shepherds to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially when official early warning systems fail. Despite a $37 million GLOF-II project launched in 2017, communities have shown widespread distrust due to repeated system failures, lack of maintenance, and poor community engagement. The government’s early warning systems remain ineffective, with reports indicating no real-time link between local sensors and rescue teams. In contrast, individuals like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain have saved lives through traditional, community-based alerting methods. Climate change is exacerbating the situation, with rising temperatures accelerating glacier melt and increasing flood risks. The article highlights the urgent need for integrating Indigenous knowledge with official systems to build climate resilience, especially in one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations.",
