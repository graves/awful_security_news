  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef designed to restore a historically lost coral ecosystem. The project, led by artist and cultural placemaker Ximena Caminos and coral scientist Colin Foord, combines art and marine science to create an underwater ecotourism destination. Art installations, including 22 concrete-cast cars and a future constellation of 57 starfish, will serve as structural platforms for resilient corals such as gorgonians to grow. These corals, cultivated in a nursery, will transform the sculptures into living reefs, restoring marine biodiversity. The project, funded by a $5 million city bond and aiming for $6 million in additional funding, will be accessible to swimmers within 15 to 20 feet of the shore. It not only revives a once-vital reef but also serves as an educational tool and a potential cultural symbol for Miami Beach.",
