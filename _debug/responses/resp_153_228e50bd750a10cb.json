  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using artificial intelligence chatbots—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok—to determine voting preferences, stating that these models provide distorted, polarized, and biased political advice. Tests on 1,500 fictional voter profiles revealed that AI systems frequently recommended fringe parties like the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) or the left-wing Green Left-Labour Party, while significantly underrepresenting moderate parties such as Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The watchdog emphasizes that AI systems are untransparent, unverifiable, and potentially manipulative, threatening the integrity of democratic elections. It urges voters to avoid using AI for voting decisions and calls on chatbot providers to prevent their platforms from being used as political voting guides. This comes as the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, is poised for another strong showing in the upcoming October 29 election, following political instability over immigration policy and the party’s repeated refusal to support coalition governments.",
