  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 23-year-old Philadelphia woman, Kada Scott, went missing on October 4, 2025, after being last seen at her workplace. Two weeks later, human remains were found in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in a wooded area, prompting officials to determine if they belong to Scott. Police have arrested 21-year-old Keon King, who is charged with her kidnapping and a prior domestic kidnapping case, based on phone tracking and digital evidence showing contact with Scott. King, who was previously charged in a domestic incident that was dropped in May, is now facing refiled charges, with a preliminary hearing expected soon. Investigators believe the case may be part of a pattern of behavior. A public tip led to the discovery of a gold 1999 Toyota Camry linked to King, which was found in a parking lot. Authorities are searching the vehicle and investigating whether other individuals were involved. The case is being led by the Philadelphia Police Department with assistance from the FBI’s Violent Crime Task Force. The family, particularly Scott’s parents, has expressed deep anguish and has urged the public to come forward with any information. The city and officials are committed to ensuring accountability and providing support to the family.",
