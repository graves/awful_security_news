  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be contributing to illegal deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon through its supply chain, particularly in the high-deforestation Pará state. The investigation finds that cattle from illegally deforested land are being transported through a 'laundering' system—using Brazil’s anonymous GTA transit permit system—that hides their origins before reaching JBS. Despite JBS acknowledging traceability gaps in a 2024 SEC filing and making promises to trace suppliers by 2026, the lack of individual animal tracking and enforcement makes it impossible to verify compliance. Human Rights Watch and environmental advocates highlight that federal and state governments have slow or incomplete plans to implement full traceability, with Pará’s 2023 decree and the federal Ministry of Agriculture’s 2024 plan set to roll out by 2026 and 2032, respectively. Critics argue that voluntary corporate pledges are insufficient and that stronger, enforceable regulations are needed to hold companies accountable for environmental damage and human rights abuses linked to land grabs in protected Indigenous and sustainable areas.",
