  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and significant coaching decisions. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Giants, becoming the first team since 2007 to overcome a shutout scenario after leading by 18 points in the first three quarters. Quarterback Bo Nix led a thrilling comeback with four touchdowns in the final period, including deep passes to Marvin Mims and Courtland Sutton. Meanwhile, Drake Maye of the New England Patriots broke Tom Brady’s franchise record for completion percentage (88.5%) with a 91.3% mark in a 31-13 win over the Titans, marking a turning point in the Patriots' rebuild. On the other hand, several teams faced instability, including the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, where starting quarterbacks Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields were benched due to poor performances. The Dolphins lost to the Browns 31-6, with Tagovailoa throwing three interceptions, while the Jets lost to the Panthers 13-6, with Fields benched at halftime after a sluggish first half. The article underscores the unpredictability of the NFL season, with a record number of lead changes and a shift in quarterback dynamics reflecting broader trends in team performance and player development.",
