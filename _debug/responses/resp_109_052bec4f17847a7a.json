  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge ordered the Department of Defense to return books on race and gender to school libraries at military bases after students claimed their First Amendment rights were violated by the removal of nearly 600 books. The books, which covered topics like sexual identity, racism, and LGBTQ+ pride, were removed in response to executive orders from former President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, which banned instruction on gender ideology and critical race theory. Students from schools in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy, and Japan reported being punished for protesting these actions and becoming fearful of discussing race and gender in class. The ACLU filed a legal motion on their behalf, and Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled that the removals were not pedagogical but driven by improper partisan motives, concluding that the books and curricula must be restored to ensure free speech and inclusive education in military school environments.",
