  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have enabled new treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full cycle of announcements spans from October 6 to October 13, with prizes in physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics following in sequence. The article highlights the scientific, cultural, and political significance of each prize, noting that the 2024 winners in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and economics have made transformative contributions to their respective fields. The 2025 peace prize announcement has sparked global debate, particularly regarding U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims of deserving the prize for ending wars, despite expert skepticism due to the prize’s focus on durable peace and institutional efforts. The article also underscores concerns about political interference in science, especially from the Trump administration, and emphasizes the independence of the Nobel committees, which maintain secrecy and integrity in the nomination and selection process. The prizes remain one of the world’s most prestigious recognitions of human achievement, reflecting both scientific progress and global social values.",
