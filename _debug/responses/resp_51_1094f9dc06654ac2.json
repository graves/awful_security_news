  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the context of a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, the return and identification of the twelfth deceased hostage — Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri — marks a critical, though incomplete, step in the recovery of missing family members. The other body, that of Israeli man Ronen Engel, was also returned, highlighting both the emotional toll on families and the political leverage tied to hostage remains. While Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains, Israel suspects it may be withholding information or using the bodies as leverage. The situation is further strained by the closure of the Rafah crossing, which severely limits humanitarian aid, and by ongoing Israeli military actions, including strikes on civilian vehicles. The US State Department warns of an imminent Hamas violation of the ceasefire, prompting accusations from Hamas that Israel is violating the agreement. Protests have erupted in Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed. As the ceasefire enters its second week, the return of bodies remains central to both peace negotiations and public trust in the agreement.",
