  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, responding to China’s export controls on rare earth metals and advanced technology. China, which holds a near-monopoly on rare earths essential for electronics and defence, justified its restrictions as a national security measure in response to US trade curbs on Chinese entities and industries. This escalation follows a history of tit-for-tat tariffs dating back to 2018, including Trump’s 25% and later 145% tariffs, and Biden’s semiconductor export controls. The actions risk reigniting a trade war, particularly as Trump and Xi are set to meet in South Korea during the APEC summit. Experts argue that both nations are using national security justifications to weaponize economic interdependence, with China having taken a more strategic and coordinated approach, while the US appears to lack consistent policy coherence. The conflict is not only a bilateral issue but a global one, affecting supply chains, technology development, and economic stability across the Indo-Pacific and beyond.",
