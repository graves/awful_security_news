  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a coastal Philippine island, evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approached, with forecasted gusts of up to 80km/h and a risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters. The evacuation is part of a repeated drill, as Catanduanes is often the first landmass affected by Pacific cyclones. The Philippines, frequently hit by storms and earthquakes, is currently recovering from multiple disasters, including a deadly magnitude 6.9 and 7.4 earthquake, and Typhoon Ragasa. Scientists link the increasing intensity of storms to climate change, indicating a growing threat to vulnerable populations in disaster-prone regions.",
