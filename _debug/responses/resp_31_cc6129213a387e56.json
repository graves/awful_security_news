  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man from Rhode Island, was sentenced to five years to life in prison by a Utah judge after being convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. Rossi faked his death in 2020, claiming he died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which misled authorities and allowed him to evade arrest for years. He was identified through a decade-old DNA match from a rape kit backlog, and later arrested in Scotland in 2023 due to recognition of his distinctive tattoos, including a Brown University crest. He used multiple aliases, including 'Arthur Knight,' to conceal his identity. Both victims testified, describing financial manipulation and abusive behavior, including requests for money and debt for engagement rings. Prosecutors argued Rossi posed a danger to public safety, while his lawyers urged parole. This case underscores the impact of DNA testing in clearing old cases and the dangers of false death claims by individuals with criminal histories.",
