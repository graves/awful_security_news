  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in a dramatic Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, advancing to their first World Series since 1993. The game featured a pivotal three-run home run by George Springer in the seventh inning, which turned the momentum in Toronto’s favor after the Mariners had taken an early lead. Controversy arose during the first inning when a groundball play involving Josh Naylor and Ernie Clement led to a disputed call, with replays showing the ball ricocheting off Naylor’s helmet. Despite earlier setbacks and injuries to Springer, who was hit in the knee during Game 5, he returned and delivered the decisive hit. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was named ALCS MVP with a .385 batting average and three home runs. The Blue Jays will now host the defending champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, in the World Series, while the Mariners remain the only MLB franchise to never appear in a World Series.",
