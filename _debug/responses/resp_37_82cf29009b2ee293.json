  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article exposes the hidden realities of Guatemalan garment factories (maquilas), where women workers endure long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats—often under the control of Korean-owned companies. Despite the sector’s economic significance, with nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP tied to apparel, workers have little legal protection, union activity is suppressed, and enforcement by the government is hampered by obstruction. U.S. brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren source from these factories without direct responsibility for labor conditions. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face financial ruin upon job loss, and union leaders like Corina Olivares operate under constant fear of violence. The article highlights a systemic failure of accountability, with even new political leadership under President Bernardo Arévalo struggling to deliver meaningful change, and raises urgent concerns about gender-based exploitation and labor rights in global supply chains.",
