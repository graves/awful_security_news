  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Israeli military announced that two coffins containing the remains of deceased Israeli hostages have crossed into Israel from Gaza, following the implementation of a ceasefire agreement brokered by the Trump administration. The bodies are being processed at the National Institute for Forensic Medicine for identification, marking the 14th and 15th deceased hostages returned since October 9. Hamas, under the terms of the deal, was required to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours, but Israel's intelligence agencies believe Hamas may not be able to locate all remaining bodies due to the war-damaged terrain and difficulty in recovery. One previously delivered body was misidentified and did not belong to an Israeli hostage. US Vice President JD Vance emphasized the immense difficulty of recovering bodies buried under rubble and stated that the process will not happen overnight. The incident highlights the fragility of the ceasefire, ongoing accusations of violations, and the deep human and political consequences of the conflict.",
