    "Brett James, a Grammy-winning songwriter known for collaborating with major artists like Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, and Keith Urban, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, when his single-engine Cirrus SR22T aircraft entered a 'tightening spiral' after a radio frequency error.",
    "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) preliminary report indicates that James had requested a visual approach to runway 7, which was approved, but failed to change his radio frequency to the common traffic advisory frequency, leading to a communication breakdown.",
    "James announced his position at 6,800 feet and planned a 360-degree turn, but air traffic control attempted to alert him that he had not changed the frequency, and no further communication occurred.",
    "The plane flew over the runway and descended into a left turn before entering the spiral and crashing, with no mechanical issues found in the wreckage.",
    "Brett James was a highly influential songwriter, notably co-writing Carrie Underwood’s breakout song 'Jesus, Take the Wheel' in 2005, which marked a major career milestone in country music."
