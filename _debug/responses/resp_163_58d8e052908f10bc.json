  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI voice scam targeted wealthy Italian businessmen in early 2025, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, urging victims to send money to free kidnapped journalists. The scam, which occurred shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala, exploited the realism of modern AI voice cloning, with studies showing that AI-generated voices are indistinguishable from real ones and even rated as more trustworthy. Only Massimo Moratti, former Inter Milan owner, sent money, which was later frozen by police. The broader implications include rising global losses from deepfake scams—over $547 million globally from January to June 2024—and the alarming use of AI to generate non-consensual sexual content, including child sexual abuse material. In response, governments like the United States (under President Donald Trump) and Australia have introduced laws and bans to regulate such misuse. While AI voice technology offers benefits like restoring speech for individuals with disabilities, its misuse poses significant threats to personal security, financial integrity, and societal trust.",
