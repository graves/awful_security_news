  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a coastal island in the Philippines, have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, with forecasts indicating heavy rainfall and a moderate risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high. The storm's eye is expected to pass near the island, where residents have repeatedly participated in evacuation drills due to its position as a first-impact zone for western Pacific cyclones. Officials, including rescue official Gerry Rubio, have activated emergency plans for high-risk areas such as the coast and landslide-prone slopes. This event occurs amid a period of ongoing disaster activity, including deadly earthquakes in Cebu and the southern Philippines, and the prior impact of Typhoon Ragasa, illustrating the Philippines’ persistent vulnerability to natural disasters. Scientists warn that increasing storm intensity is linked to climate change and global warming, reinforcing concerns about future disaster resilience.",
