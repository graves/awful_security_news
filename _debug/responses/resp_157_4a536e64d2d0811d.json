  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be fueling illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa. The investigation highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle raised on illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through a system of transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual animal records. This lack of traceability means JBS cannot verify that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation. The report underscores the role of Pará, the state with the highest deforestation rates in Brazil, where illegal land grabs by criminal groups and farmers have led to violence, displacement, and destruction of Indigenous communities. Despite government initiatives—such as a 2023 decree in Pará and a 2024 federal plan to implement cattle tracking by 2032—advocacy groups argue these timelines are too slow. JBS has previously failed to meet its 2011 promise to identify all indirect suppliers, and experts emphasize that stronger, publicly accessible traceability systems are urgently needed to hold companies and governments accountable for deforestation linked to meat production.",
