  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated its drone attacks on Ukraine’s power, water, and heat infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, with repeated strikes over the past month. These attacks are part of a strategic effort to terrorize civilians through cold and prolonged suffering, as described by President Zelensky. Ukrainian officials report that drones are deliberately circling damaged sites to prevent repairs and prolong crises. Ukraine is struggling with insufficient air defenses and has not received promised U.S. Tomahawk missiles. In response, Zelensky and European allies are turning to financial and military support, including proposing the use of $200 billion in frozen Russian assets to fund Patriot air defense systems and long-range missiles. The situation is further complicated by geopolitical tensions, including concerns about a possible summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, and a cyclical pattern observed by analysts linking U.S. frustration with Russian escalation. The article underscores the humanitarian toll, the strategic importance of energy infrastructure, and the growing reliance on international support to counter Russia’s asymmetric warfare tactics.",
