    "Ciattarelli's campaign has threatened to sue Sherrill for defamation over claims of mass death related to opioids.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are locked in a close and increasingly personal contest, despite New Jersey's historically blue political leanings. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, is backed by former President Barack Obama and is advocating against Trump-aligned policies and opioid-related harms, while Ciattarelli, a pro-Trump figure with strong ties to Donald Trump, has received the president’s endorsement and is pushing for tax reforms. The race has intensified with personal attacks—Sherrill claims Ciattarelli helped cause opioid-related deaths; Ciattarelli blames Sherrill for being barred from walking at her naval academy graduation. However, voter concerns about rising living costs, especially in energy and housing, remain central. With Democrats holding a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage and no three-term governor from the same party since the 1960s, the outcome may hinge on who can best communicate a compelling message around affordability and fiscal responsibility.",
