  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, who faked his death in 2020 to evade arrest on rape charges, to a prison term of five years to life. Rossi, previously known as Nicholas Alahverdian, was identified through a decade-old DNA match from a rape kit backlog in Utah. After being arrested in Scotland due to distinctive tattoos recognized by Interpol, he was extradited to Utah and convicted of raping two women in 2008. Prosecutors argued he was a flight risk and a serial abuser, while Rossi maintained his innocence and claimed the victims were lying. The victim described the trauma of the assault and emphasized a plea for accountability and safety. Rossi, who used multiple aliases and lived in Rhode Island, previously faced sex-related charges in Ohio and failed to register as a sex offender. The case highlights the challenges of addressing sexual violence and the importance of closing rape kit backlogs to bring perpetrators to justice.",
