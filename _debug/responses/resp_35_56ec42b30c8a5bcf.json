  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private Mexican-registered Hawker 800XP business jet crashed during a post-maintenance test flight near Lansing, Michigan, killing all three on board — two pilots and a maintenance representative. Preliminary data show the aircraft climbed to 15,000 feet before experiencing a sudden and violent descent, reaching up to 24,000 feet per minute. Audio from air traffic control captures pilots repeatedly requesting 'stall recovery,' indicating an attempted correction of a dangerous flight condition. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation, noting a disturbing similarity to a fatal crash involving a similar Hawker 800XP in February 2024, where a stall warning system was also being tested. The aircraft had not flown since March 2025, and flight tracking data confirms its departure from Battle Creek Executive Airport. Duncan Aviation, which conducted the maintenance, has expressed support for the affected families and acknowledged the tragic loss of crew and maintenance personnel.",
