    "Enshittification is a process by which internet platforms degrade in quality, shifting from user-centric models to business-centric, profit-driven ones.",
    "The process occurs in three stages: (1) user acquisition with attractive deals, (2) favoring business customers at user expense, and (3) monetizing users and businesses through exploitative pricing and algorithmic manipulation.",
    "Platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber are cited as examples where user experience deteriorates due to data harvesting, ad targeting, and algorithmic bias.",
    "Amazon is accused of cloning products, charging junk fees (up to 51 cents per dollar earned), and distorting search results, leading to higher prices for consumers.",
    "Facebook is accused of altering feeds to promote ads and boosted content, reducing user control and experience.",
    "The degradation is attributed to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, with Doctorow advocating for antitrust enforcement and greater interoperability between platforms.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article presents a theory of 'enshittification' — a degradation process in internet platforms — developed by internet activist and journalist Cory Doctorow. It outlines three stages: user acquisition with attractive deals, favoring business customers at user expense, and exploitative monetization. Platforms like Facebook and Amazon are cited as examples, where user experience deteriorates due to algorithmic manipulation, data harvesting, and inflated fees. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak regulation, proposing solutions such as 'right-to-exit' policies and interoperability. Despite Amazon's rebuttals, the article highlights growing public and policy interest in reversing platform degradation through antitrust reforms and consumer protection measures.",
