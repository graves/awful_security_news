  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian solidarity activist and legal permanent resident, was detained in March 2025 by U.S. immigration authorities following his activism at Columbia University. He was released in June 2025 by a federal district court in New Jersey on a habeas corpus petition, which challenged the legality of his detention. The government argues that Khalil’s presence poses adverse foreign policy consequences and that he concealed his work with UNRWA on immigration forms, justifying deportation. However, the ACLU and Khalil’s legal team assert that using foreign policy grounds to deport individuals for expressing political opinions violates constitutional free speech protections. While the habeas petition is under appeal, the government’s immigration judge previously ordered Khalil’s removal, which is now being reviewed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. A separate judicial ruling found that the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on Palestine solidarity activists is unlawful, violating free speech rights. The case is central to a larger national debate over whether immigration enforcement can be used as a tool to silence political dissent.",
