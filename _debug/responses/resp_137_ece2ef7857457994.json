Despite this step, he still officially holds the title, which was granted by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The controversy intensified with new emails revealing Andrew’s continued contact with Epstein and the publication of Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' in which she alleges multiple sexual encounters with Andrew when she was 17. Andrew has denied the claims and settled a civil suit with Giuffre in 2022, acknowledging her suffering but not admitting wrongdoing. Political figures, including SNP lawmaker Stephen Flynn, have called for formal removal of Andrew’s titles through parliamentary action, citing public outrage and the need for accountability. The UK government supports the palace’s decision but emphasizes constitutional boundaries. Questions remain about Andrew’s financial arrangements for his residence at Royal Lodge, which he rents from the Crown Estate. Further scrutiny is underway from the Metropolitan Police, investigating whether Andrew sought information about Giuffre’s criminal record in 2011. As public attention grows, the royal family faces mounting pressure to address its ties to Epstein and the broader implications for public trust.",
