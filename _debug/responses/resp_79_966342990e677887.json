  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of 23-year-old missing woman Kada Scott were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia, confirmed through DNA testing. The discovery was prompted by a more specific anonymous tip that led investigators to re-examine a previously searched location. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possibly homicide, with evidence showing his cellphone activity and vehicle sightings linked to the timeline of Scott’s disappearance. A black Hyundai Accent, reported stolen the day before Scott went missing, was seen in a recreation center and later found on fire, adding to the circumstantial evidence. While King was previously released on $200,000 bail after charges were dropped in another case, this new investigation suggests deeper criminal involvement. Prosecutors say more charges are being pursued, and they believe others may have been involved after the fact. Scott’s parents have expressed deep sorrow, calling her a source of light and kindness.",
