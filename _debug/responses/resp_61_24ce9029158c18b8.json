  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is facing growing pressure to drop out of the race, primarily from his boss John Catsimatidis and former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is attempting to unite Republicans against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Catsimatidis, who owns WABC-AM where Sliwa hosts a show, publicly urges Sliwa to step aside, claiming he should love New York more than anything else. In response, Sliwa has defiantly defended his campaign, rejecting claims that he is not viable or representative of regular voters, and criticizing billionaire donors and political elites like Bill Ackman and Andrew Cuomo. Trump has also dismissed Sliwa, mocking his appeal to animals and calling him 'not exactly primetime'. Despite this pressure, Sliwa remains active, citing a strong debate performance and a commitment to representing blue-collar working-class New Yorkers. The situation has created tension between grassroots candidates and elite-backed political figures, with Mamdani and Sliwa forming a rare alliance against perceived elite influence in city politics.",
