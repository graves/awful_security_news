  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—including five newly added metals—and restricted access to refining equipment, effective from December 1, 2025. The move, framed under national security grounds and citing unauthorized military transfers, is timed just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea. As the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, China leverages this control to strengthen its negotiating position. The US, which imports 70% of its rare-earth materials from China, faces significant risks in critical defence sectors—such as F-35 jets, submarines, and smart munitions—and civilian technologies including electric vehicles and AI systems. Analysts interpret the restrictions as a strategic signal of leverage, potentially deepening the US military and industrial vulnerability amid rising Indo-Pacific tensions. Despite exemptions for emergency medical and disaster relief, the controls underscore the interdependence and geopolitical sensitivity of global supply chains.",
