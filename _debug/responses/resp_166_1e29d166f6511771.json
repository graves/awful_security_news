Prosecutors reclassified the act as a politically motivated terror attack, emphasizing its threat to democratic governance. The verdict has intensified political polarization, with Fico accused of authoritarianism and increased anti-EU and pro-Russia rhetoric, while also facing backlash for targeting media and NGOs. The case underscores broader concerns about democratic erosion in Slovakia and the country’s shifting foreign and domestic policies.",
