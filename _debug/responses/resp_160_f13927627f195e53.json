Despite an increase from five to 26 distribution points, the WFP emphasizes that full access is missing, especially in northern Gaza, where the Salah al-Din Street remains blocked. The ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump is cited as vital for sustaining humanitarian access, while Hamas has returned 13 of 28 pledged captives’ bodies. The Rafah crossing remains closed until further notice, and civilians are rationing food due to fears of renewed conflict or supply collapse.",
