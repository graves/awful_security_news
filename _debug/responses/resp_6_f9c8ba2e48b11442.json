    "The U.S. conducted a seventh strike on a boat believed to be linked to a Colombian terrorist organization and carrying substantial narcotics in the Caribbean.",
    "All three individuals on the boat were killed in the strike, and no U.S. personnel were injured.",
    "This follows a pattern of hardline military actions by the Trump administration against drug trafficking vessels, including a prior strike where survivors were released to their home countries (Ecuador and Colombia).",
    "President Donald Trump described drug cartels as the 'Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere' and justified lethal strikes by equating them to terrorist organizations.",

    "This approach departs from historical norms, where drug traffickers were treated as criminals subject to arrest and trial, not targeted for summary killing.",
    "The Senate blocked earlier efforts to restrict presidential war powers in relation to such strikes, with only Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine) supporting a resolution to rein in the president's authority.",
    "Colombian President Gustavo Petro publicly criticized the U.S. for allegedly killing an innocent Colombian national and responded by accusing the U.S. of involvement in drug trafficking, leading to the cancellation of all U.S. payments and subsidies to Colombia.",

    "The military actions have sparked significant diplomatic tensions and legal debate over the use of lethal force against non-state actors without due process."
