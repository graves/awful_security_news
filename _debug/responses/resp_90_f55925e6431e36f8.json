  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a federal shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, essential federal workers — including those at the Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs — are facing unprecedented anxiety over taking time off. Workers fear that using sick or vacation leave during the shutdown will result in being furloughed, and in some cases, their furlough notices are being categorized as 'disciplinary and adverse actions,' a practice not seen before. Supervisors are giving conflicting guidance, with some employees being told they cannot take leave even for medical procedures, potentially risking termination or being labeled absent without leave (AWOL). The Trump administration has also issued reductions in force (RIF) notices to nearly 4,100 workers, with a judge halting the action, and has questioned a 2019 law that guarantees retroactive pay for furloughed employees. Experts and union leaders argue that treating furloughs as disciplinary actions represents a harmful escalation of mistreatment, piling risk on top of existing job insecurity. This situation reflects a broader crisis in federal workforce management, where employees feel forced to choose between their health and their careers.",
