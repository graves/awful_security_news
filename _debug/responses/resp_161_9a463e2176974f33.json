    "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have begun with the awarding of the Physiology or Medicine Prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced research into cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "The Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will, recognizing individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.",
    "The prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (physics, chemistry, economics), the Nobel Assembly (medicine), the Swedish Academy (literature), and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (peace).",
    "Each laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million).",
    "The formal award ceremonies take place on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.",
    "The nomination process is highly secretive: nominations are submitted by experts, past winners, and academics by January 31, and nominees are not revealed publicly; committee members cannot discuss decisions for 50 years.",
    "The Peace Prize often reflects current global events, but is judged on durability of peace, institutional work, and promotion of international cooperation, not political self-promotion.",
    "Despite public attention, Donald Trump’s claims of deserving the Peace Prize are considered unlikely by experts due to a lack of alignment with the prize’s values of peace and institutional work.",
    "There are concerns about academic freedom being threatened by political interference, notably from the Trump administration, as noted by Ylva Engstrom of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",
    "The 2024 winners include Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun (medicine) for microRNA discoveries, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton (physics) for foundational work in machine learning, David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper (chemistry) for protein structure prediction using AI, Han Kang (literature) for her exploration of trauma and identity, and Nihon Hidankyo (peace) for its nuclear disarmament advocacy, and Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (economic sciences) for their analysis of how institutions shape economic growth and inequality."

The full schedule of announcements spans from October 6 to October 13, with prizes in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics being revealed in sequence. The Nobel Prizes, established by Alfred Nobel’s will, remain the world’s most prestigious international awards, recognizing individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. The nomination process emphasizes secrecy and scientific integrity, with experts and institutions evaluating hundreds of entries over months. The 2024 laureates include Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun (medicine), John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton (physics), David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper (chemistry), Han Kang (literature), Nihon Hidankyo (peace), and Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (economic sciences).
