  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly 20 years, will relinquish control and disarm following the 2023 war. Despite promises under the Trump ceasefire plan, Hamas continues to engage in violent acts such as impromptu executions and attacks on rival groups. The group has lost key leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, and its military and political structures are weakened. While some experts, like Dr. Ahmad Yousef, believe Hamas may transition to a political role like the ANC in South Africa, others, like Dr. Michael Milshtein, argue that Hamas will remain dominant and that a new war is likely within five years. Hamas’s extensive tunnel network — built over decades and now used as both military and prison infrastructure — remains a major concern. International actors including the US, Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar are attempting to mediate, but deep divisions among Gazans and the group's violent legacy make a peaceful transition highly uncertain. The article raises broader questions about how to end the conflict, suggesting that defeating ideology through a vision of a two-state solution may be more effective than military confrontation.",
