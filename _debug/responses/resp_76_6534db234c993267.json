  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range weapon with a combat history in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan, remains a key strategic asset in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly advocated for the delivery of Tomahawks to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory — such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov — in order to weaken Russian infrastructure and force negotiations. However, the U.S. has few Tomahawks left, with President Donald Trump stating that the U.S. needs them for its own defense. The Kremlin views the supply of Tomahawks as a hostile act, warning it threatens global security due to the missile’s nuclear capability. Ukraine lacks a viable ground-launch system like the Typhon to deploy these missiles, and while its own Flamingo missile program is being developed, it remains unproven and under-resourced. As such, despite its strategic potential, Ukraine is still unable to access Tomahawks for now, and the broader conflict continues to be dominated by air defenses and attritional warfare rather than long-range strike capabilities.",
