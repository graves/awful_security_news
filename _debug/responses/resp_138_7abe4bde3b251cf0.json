  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenny Loggins has objected to the use of his song 'Danger Zone' from the 1986 film 'Top Gun,' which was used in an AI-generated video showing President Donald Trump dumping excrement from a fighter jet during 'No Kings' protests. The video, posted on Truth Social, was not approved by Loggins, who claims he was not asked for permission and says the content is designed to divide Americans. This incident follows a pattern of Trump using copyrighted music from films and artists in AI-generated political content, including Blue Oyster Cult's 'Don’t Fear the Reaper' in a prior post. Musicians like Adele and Bruce Springsteen have previously objected to Trump’s use of music, reinforcing concerns about intellectual property misuse. The White House responded with a 'Top Gun' still, reinterpreting the narrative. The 'No Kings' protests, which drew large crowds, are seen as a resistance to authoritarian policies, and the video has intensified debates over the ethics of AI-generated political content.",
