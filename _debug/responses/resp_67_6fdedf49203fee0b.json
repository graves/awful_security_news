  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to halt India’s purchases of Russian oil, a claim India strongly denies, asserting no such conversation occurred and that it remains a major energy importer. India has maintained consistent and significant imports of Russian oil—particularly through state-owned refiner IOCL—making abrupt cessation impractical due to volume, quality, and refinery constraints. Analysts, including Muyu Xu from Kpler, emphasize that replacing Russian crude is logistically and economically challenging. India’s resistance to U.S. pressure reflects its broader foreign policy of strategic autonomy, reinforcing Modi’s image as a strong, independent leader. Diplomatic efforts between India and the U.S. continue, with both sides acknowledging trade tensions but committed to negotiation.",
