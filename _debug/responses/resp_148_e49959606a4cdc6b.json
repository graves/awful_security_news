  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), under the UN, has urged global action to address the critical gap in early-warning systems for extreme weather events. Despite progress in monitoring over the past decade, nearly half of countries still lack adequate systems, with devastating consequences—disaster-related deaths being six times higher in countries without such systems. The article highlights real-world events in 2025, including floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US, all underscoring the urgency of climate-driven disasters. A key example is the Swiss village of Blatten, where glacier monitoring in May 2025 allowed for timely evacuation, demonstrating the life-saving potential of early warnings. The WMO emphasizes that early warning is not just about alerts but about enabling early action to protect lives and infrastructure, especially in vulnerable and conflict-affected regions, and calls for global investment and coordination to close the monitoring gap.",
