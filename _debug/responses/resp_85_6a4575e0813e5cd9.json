  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) during arrival from Dubai at around 3:50 a.m. on October 19, 2025. The aircraft, a Boeing model, broke in two upon departure from the runway, colliding with an airport security patrol car and pushing it into the sea, resulting in the deaths of two staff members. The four crew members on board were unharmed and received medical treatment. No distress signals were reported by the pilots. The airport suspended operations on the north runway while emergency responders, including over 200 personnel, worked to manage the incident. Despite the severity, operations on the other two runways continued, minimizing disruption to over 1,000 daily flights. The flight was wet-leased from ACT Airlines, which operates cargo capacity for Emirates, and no cargo was onboard. This incident underscores the rare but serious risk of aviation accidents at one of the world’s busiest and most advanced airports, with historical context provided by past accidents, such as the 1999 China Airlines crash at the old Kai Tak Airport.",
