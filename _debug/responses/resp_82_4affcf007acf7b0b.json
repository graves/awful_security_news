Fitzgerald denies the claims, asserting that the memos shared with counsel were unclassified at the time and that a later upclassification does not negate this fact. The Justice Department’s inspector general found no evidence of classified material being released, and experts highlight ethical concerns about a defense lawyer being both a witness and a legal representative in the same case, especially in politically sensitive matters involving presidential interactions and national security.",
