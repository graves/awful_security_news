    "Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón has recommended that a judge resentence Lyle and Erik Menendez to life with the possibility of parole, after a review that included new evidence of sexual abuse by their father.",
    "The brothers have served life without parole since 1996, but under California law, due to their age at the time of the crime (under 26), they are eligible for youthful parole if resentenced to life with possibility of parole.",
    "The defense’s 2023 habeas corpus petition cited new evidence, including a sworn statement from Roy Rosselló and a letter from Erik Menendez, alleging lifelong sexual abuse by their father, which was excluded during the original trial.",
    "Gascón stated that modern legal perspectives on abuse and rehabilitation have changed, and that the public and courts today would likely view the case differently than in 1996.",
    "The decision has drawn support from public figures like Kim Kardashian and criticism from some who see it as politically motivated, though Gascón denies this and emphasizes it as a matter of justice and truth.",
    "The case has gained renewed attention due to the release of the Netflix series 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story' and a documentary featuring the brothers discussing their trauma.",
    "Gascón, a candidate for reelection, supports sentencing reform and has pushed for over 300 resentencings in his tenure, including 28 for murder."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón has recommended that a judge resentence Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted in 1996 for the 1989 murders of their parents, to life with the possibility of parole. This decision follows a 2023 habeas corpus petition by the brothers’ attorneys citing new evidence of sexual and physical abuse by their father, Jose Menendez, including a sworn statement from former Menudo member Roy Rosselló and a letter from Erik Menendez. Gascón, who is campaigning for reelection on sentencing reform, argues that modern legal standards and societal understanding of abuse have evolved, and that the brothers have demonstrated rehabilitation and have paid their debt to society. The brothers have been serving life without parole for nearly 30 years, and under California law, due to their age at the time of the crime, they would be eligible for youthful parole if resentenced. A hearing is expected within 30 to 45 days, though no date has been set. The case has gained renewed public attention due to a Netflix series and documentary. The decision has been praised as a step toward justice and truth by family members and public figures, including Kim Kardashian and Anamaria Baralt, though some have questioned whether it is politically motivated.",
