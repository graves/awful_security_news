    "She is known as Japan’s 'Iron Lady' due to her conservative ideology, drawing comparisons to Margaret Thatcher, and supports policies like Abenomics, stronger defense, and a hard line on immigration and same-sex marriage.",
    "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage, takes a firm stance on immigration, and supports the imperial succession preference for men.",

    "Her past visits to the Yasukuni Shrine—where WWII war criminals are enshrined—remain a sensitive and controversial issue in Japan and internationally.",
    "Takaichi’s victory comes amid a weakened LDP, which lost its majority in recent years and had to form a new coalition with the Japan Innovation Party after a collapse in its alliance with the far-right Sanseito party.",
    "Despite her conservative platform, she will not alter Japan’s existing social welfare system, which is a key feature of Japanese conservatism.",
    "Her leadership marks a right-wing shift in Japan’s governance, emphasizing security, US-Japan alliance, and strong stance on China and regional stability.",
    "Takaichi faces significant challenges including a cost of living crisis, US trade tensions under Donald Trump, and long-term security threats from China and North Korea.",
    "The LDP is still recovering from a major corruption scandal, and Takaichi may need to soften her political stance to avoid a no-confidence vote in the near future."
