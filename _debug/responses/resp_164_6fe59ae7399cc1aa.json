  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of AI-powered voice scams targeted wealthy Italian businessmen in early 2025, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request large financial transfers. The scam coincided with the release of journalist Cecilia Sala and occurred shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni took office. Research from Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants often rating them as more trustworthy. The global financial losses from such scams have risen sharply, reaching over $547 million between January and June 2025. The growing sophistication of AI voice technology raises serious concerns about identity theft, fraud, and misuse in creating fake media and child sexual abuse material. In response, the US and Australia have introduced legal measures to criminalize the distribution of AI-generated intimate images, highlighting a global push to regulate the ethical and safety implications of AI voice and video generation.",
