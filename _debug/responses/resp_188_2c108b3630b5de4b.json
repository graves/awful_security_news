  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of diplomatic and military tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the suspension of all U.S. subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' who is fostering widespread drug production. This decision follows a U.S. military strike in September 2025 on a Colombian fishing boat, where fisherman Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed, prompting Petro to accuse the U.S. of violating sovereignty and committing 'murder'. The U.S. claims the attacks target drug trafficking, including fentanyl-laden vessels, but provides no evidence of vessel identities or cargo. UN human rights experts have labeled the strikes as 'extrajudicial executions', intensifying international concern. The move comes amid a broader pattern of U.S. military operations in the Caribbean Sea, including a recent attack on a submarine, with survivors being returned to Colombia and Ecuador. The situation also involves escalating tensions with Venezuela, where Trump has authorized CIA covert operations and is considering attacks on Venezuelan soil, while President Nicolás Maduro accuses the U.S. of making Venezuela an 'American colony'.",
