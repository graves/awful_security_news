  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has begun demolishing part of the White House’s East Wing, a historically significant and traditionally used space by the first lady, to construct a $250 million ballroom. Despite not securing approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal construction, Trump claims the project is privately funded and will cost nothing to taxpayers. The demolition, which began in September 2025 and is scheduled for completion before January 2029, includes site preparation and the addition of a 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled ballroom capable of hosting 999 people. The White House asserts that only offices will be temporarily relocated, not the building itself. Carrier Global Corp. has donated the HVAC system for the new space. The project has sparked controversy due to its lack of regulatory oversight and potential violation of federal construction protocols, raising questions about executive authority and transparency in public infrastructure projects.",
