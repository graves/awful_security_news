  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the US Marine Corps' 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, a 155mm artillery shell fired from an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the I-5 interstate highway, causing at least one fragment to strike and damage a California Highway Patrol cruiser. The event, which had been planned to showcase military capability during a VIP visit featuring Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, raised serious safety concerns. Although the highway had been closed in advance by Governor Gavin Newsom due to risks, the Marine Corps claims the route was safe in theory due to the high trajectory of the shells. However, the premature detonation, which occurred despite successful firings of over 20 shells the day before, has prompted investigation into the integrity of the shell batch and manufacturing processes. A 2024 Reuters investigation revealed past issues with shell production, including cracked shells and a shift in explosive composition, later reversed due to production demands in support of Ukraine. The incident highlights a critical gap between standard military practices and actual safety outcomes, especially when high-profile demonstrations involve civilian infrastructure.",
