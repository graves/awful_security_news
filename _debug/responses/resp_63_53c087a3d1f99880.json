  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the current surge in cowboy imagery across fashion, media, and politics, tracing its roots to 19th-century Buffalo Bill shows and its modern revival under conservative political leadership. While brands like Sweetgreen and Canada Goose and shows like 'Yellowstone' popularize the image, the article critiques how this portrayal romanticizes the cowboy and ignores the real history of Mexican, Native, and Black Americans in Western labor. It highlights the role of figures like Beyoncé and Gabriela Hasbun in bringing visibility to Black cowboys and rodeo culture, while also noting that this progress is often followed by a 'whitewashing' of the narrative. The article concludes that the cowboy is a mythologized symbol of American identity, shaped by politics, media, and nostalgia, and that its rise reflects deeper cultural anxieties about tradition, patriotism, and diversity.",
