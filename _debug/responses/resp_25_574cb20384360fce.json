    "Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network, wrote in her posthumous memoir that she was raped by a ‘well-known Prime Minister’ — a reference to Prince Andrew, who is widely believed to be the intended figure despite the discrepancy between the US and UK versions of the memoir.",
    "The memoir claims Giuffre was brutally beaten, choked, and sexually assaulted by the prime minister (Andrew), with the attacker laughing and becoming aroused during the attack, and that she feared dying as a sex slave.",
    "Giuffre alleges that Prince Andrew's team attempted to hire online trolls to discredit her during her legal proceedings, and that he allegedly paid millions to settle a civil case in 2022.",
    "Newly revealed emails show Prince Andrew wrote to Epstein in February 2011 saying they were 'in this together' and would 'play some more soon,' contradicting his earlier claim that he had broken off ties with Epstein in 2010.",
    "The memoir also alleges that Andrew had sexual relations with Giuffre when she was 17, and that Epstein allegedly trafficked her to him, describing it as one of the most violent experiences she endured.",
    "The publication of the memoir reignites the transatlantic scandal linking powerful individuals to Epstein's network, casting further doubt on Andrew’s claims of innocence and deepening public criticism of the royal family.",
    "Prince Andrew announced he would relinquish the title of Duke of York in 2025, but retained the title of Prince, citing a commitment to family and country, yet the memoir undermines this gesture by implicating him in serious abuse allegations."
