    "Climate change is increasing the number of dangerous 'superhot days' — defined as days warmer than 90% of comparable days from 1991 to 2020 — with a projected annual increase of 57 such days by 2100 under current climate commitments.",
    "The world's warming trajectory has improved from a worst-case 4°C increase (pre-Paris) to 2.6°C, reducing the number of superhot days from 114 to 57, though still representing a significant and dangerous increase.",
    "Since 2015, the planet has already added 11 average superhot days, indicating that climate impacts are already occurring and escalating.",
    "The impact of climate change on heat exposure is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in superhot days (e.g., Panama: 149 extra days), despite contributing only 1% of global carbon emissions.",
    "In contrast, major carbon emitters like the United States, China, and India — responsible for 42% of global CO₂ emissions — face only 23–30 additional superhot days, highlighting a stark disparity between emissions and climate impacts.",
    "Experts warn that this heat inequality could deepen global inequities and potentially contribute to geopolitical instability, as vulnerable nations face disproportionate harm.",
    "The study, conducted by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central, uses established climate attribution techniques and is not yet peer-reviewed but is considered scientifically robust for its methods."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that climate change is causing an additional 57 dangerous 'superhot days' per year by 2100, due to global warming of 2.6°C under current commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement. This represents a significant but reduced increase from a worst-case scenario of 114 superhot days under pre-2015 emissions pathways. The study highlights a sharp disparity in climate impacts: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive spikes in heat exposure — with Panama expected to see 149 extra days — despite contributing just 1% of global carbon emissions. In contrast, the top carbon emitters — the U.S., China, and India — face only 23–30 extra days, even though they emit 42% of global CO₂. Experts warn that this imbalance could deepen global injustice and fuel future geopolitical instability.",
