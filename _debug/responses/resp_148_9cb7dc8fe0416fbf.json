    "The world is on track to add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 due to climate change, a significant but reduced increase from the pre-Paris 4°C scenario that would have added 114 such days.",
    "Superhot days are defined as days warmer than 90% of comparable days from 1991 to 2020, using established climate attribution techniques.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days, demonstrating that climate change is already unfolding in real time.",
    "The impact of climate change is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face the largest increases in dangerous heat days, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days per year.",
    "In stark contrast, top carbon emitters like the United States, China, and India—responsible for 42% of global CO2—will face only 23–30 additional superhot days, less than 1% of the impact in vulnerable nations.",
    "This disparity highlights a profound injustice in climate exposure, with low-income, vulnerable countries bearing disproportionate burdens despite contributing minimally to emissions.",
    "Experts warn that such heat inequality could deepen global divides and contribute to geopolitical instability, especially in regions already facing climate stress.",
    "The report, though not yet peer-reviewed, uses scientifically sound methods and underscores the urgent need for stronger climate action to reduce future heat extremes."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current climate commitments, the planet will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures—due to climate change. This represents a significant improvement over the pre-Paris scenario, which would have added 114 such days under a 4°C warming trajectory. However, the study reveals a sharp inequality in climate impacts: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face dramatic increases in heat exposure—Panama alone could gain 149 extra superhot days—while major emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 additional days. Experts warn that this disparity reflects a global injustice, with vulnerable nations bearing disproportionate burdens despite contributing minimally to emissions, potentially fueling future geopolitical tensions. The report underscores the urgent need for climate action and global equity in adaptation and mitigation efforts.",
