In Quezon province, a tree fell on a bamboo house in Pitogo, killing five family members including two children, with one boy surviving. Heavy flooding and landslides affected Luzon, Samar, and Panay, forcing over 47,000 people to evacuate to shelters. A landslide in Bukidnon, Mindanao, caused a vehicle to fall from a highway, resulting in two missing persons. The storm occurred during a period of recovery from deadly earthquakes, prompting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to call for stronger disaster preparedness. Authorities released water from five dams on Luzon, and multiple flights were cancelled due to the stormâ€™s proximity. The event highlights growing concerns about climate change, as extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense.",
