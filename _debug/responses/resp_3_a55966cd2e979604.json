  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the hidden exploitation of garment workers in Guatemala’s maquila factories, where tens of thousands of mostly female workers endure long hours, low wages, and unsafe conditions, often under the control of Korean-owned factories. Despite contributing nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, these factories operate with minimal oversight, and US brands such as Carhartt, Target, and Ralph Lauren benefit from sub-contracting without legal responsibility for worker welfare. Workers face threats, harassment, and violence, including the murder of a union leader and widespread sexual abuse, while union members are often fired or intimidated. The Guatemalan government, under President Bernardo Arévalo, has taken steps to raise wages and improve labor standards, but enforcement remains weak. The article underscores how global trade policies and supply chain dynamics enable exploitation, especially of women, and highlights the urgent need for systemic reform to protect vulnerable workers and ensure labor rights are upheld.",
