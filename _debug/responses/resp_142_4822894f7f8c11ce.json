    "China has expanded its export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and maintaining restrictions on seven previously listed (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium).",
    "The restrictions apply to rare-earth magnets and semiconductor materials containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals from Beijing detailing the intended use of the products.",
    "China cites national security concerns, citing instances of foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications that threaten its security and global non-proliferation efforts.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for critical technologies such as electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, LED screens, camera lenses, F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missile systems, and AI semiconductors.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth metals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports sourced from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "China is the world's largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global output.",
    "The move is seen as a strategic signal ahead of a Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea, indicating China’s intent to leverage supply chain dominance in negotiations.",
    "The restrictions are not absolute: exports for emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief remain exempt.",
    "Experts like Gracelin Baskaran of CSIS and Kristin Vekasi of the University of Montana interpret the move as part of 'pre-meeting choreography' to strengthen China’s leverage and expose vulnerabilities in US defense and industrial supply chains.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has significantly expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, adding five new metals to its restrictions and maintaining controls on seven previously listed, now covering 12 of the 17 known rare-earth elements. The restrictions, effective from December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain Beijing approval detailing the use of the exported materials, with exemptions for emergency medical or disaster relief purposes. These controls are framed as a national security measure in response to alleged transfers of Chinese rare-earth materials for military use. Given that China dominates global rare-earth production and processing, and the US is the largest importer, the move is seen as a strategic signal ahead of a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea. Experts interpret this as part of 'pre-meeting choreography' to strengthen China’s leverage in negotiations, exposing vulnerabilities in US defense and technological supply chains. While the move threatens US defense and civilian technologies—such as electric vehicles, AI chips, and advanced weapons—the interdependence of the two economies means China’s actions also risk economic costs, underscoring the complex, intertwined nature of US-China economic relations.",
