  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th-anniversary live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, California, a 155mm artillery shell prematurely detonated over Interstate 5, striking a highway patrol vehicle. Though no injuries were reported, the incident sparked a major political standoff between California Governor Gavin Newsom, who closed the highway citing safety risks, and Vice President JD Vance, who defended the military’s actions as standard, safe practice. The California Highway Patrol called the event unusual and unsafe, and the Marine Corps confirmed that the demonstration had undergone rigorous safety checks, with operations suspended and an internal review initiated. The incident reflects broader tensions between federal military readiness and state-level public safety concerns, especially in the context of ongoing political disputes over National Guard deployment and redistricting.",
