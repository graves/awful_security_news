  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, following President Donald Trump's threat of imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's export controls on rare earth minerals. These controls, implemented in October 2025, are framed by Beijing as a defense of national security and retaliation for US restrictions on Chinese entities and industries. The US response—threatening a massive tariff and export controls on critical software—has raised fears of a new trade war, even as both nations prepare for a high-stakes meeting in South Korea. Historical context shows a long-standing pattern of tit-for-tat tariffs and export restrictions, with previous escalations under both Trump and Biden administrations. Experts argue that while China has been more strategic and organized in its policy design, the US retains significant economic leverage. The conflict reflects a broader strategic competition where both sides are weaponizing economic interdependence, with rare earths and advanced technologies at the core of the dispute.",
