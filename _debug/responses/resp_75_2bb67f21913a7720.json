  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish carrier ACT Airlines, manufactured by Boeing, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) during its arrival from Dubai, breaking in two and colliding with an airport security patrol car, which was then pushed into the sea. The collision resulted in the deaths of two staff members in the patrol car, while all four crew members on board the aircraft survived and received medical treatment. The incident occurred without any distress signals from the pilots, and despite the severity, airport operations remained largely unaffected due to the continued use of two other runways. The event has prompted a significant emergency response involving over 200 people, fire engines, and boats, and the airport has suspended operations on the north runway. This incident is notable in the context of Hong Kong's aviation history, where a similar major crash occurred in 1999, underscoring the rarity of fatal aviation accidents at one of the world’s busiest airports.",
