  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a woman at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison on October 20, 2025. After being extradited from France in 2024 following a vagrancy arrest, Cleary faced prosecution nearly 12 years after the assault. The case gained momentum in 2019 when Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you,' prompting Keeler, the victim, to renew her efforts with authorities. Despite years of inaction, lack of prosecution, and destruction of forensic evidence, Keeler pursued charges after public advocacy through an Associated Press story in 2021. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, sentenced Cleary below state guidelines due to his guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness. The case reflects broader systemic failures in campus sexual assault prosecutions, where victims face long delays, emotional trauma, and lack of support from institutions.",
