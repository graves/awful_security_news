These efforts stem from his long-standing success in branding — exemplified by the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) movement — and reflect a political strategy where the presidency is treated like a product. While such initiatives increase visibility and engagement, they have raised serious concerns about the commodification of government, ethical breaches of norms, and the politicization of public services and infrastructure. Critics, including Noah Bookbinder, argue that these actions prioritize personal promotion over public service and undermine institutional neutrality, even if they do not break any laws.",
