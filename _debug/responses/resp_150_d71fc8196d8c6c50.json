  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, both sides have exchanged the remains of captured individuals, with Hamas returning 15 Israeli captives' bodies and Israel returning bodies of 15 Palestinians killed in detention. However, Hamas accuses Israel of violating the agreement by refusing to reopen the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which has remained closed since May 2024, severely restricting humanitarian access and medical evacuations. The International Court of Justice has ordered the reopening, but Israel continues to maintain control. Human rights advocates, including Ubai Al-Aboudi, highlight systemic abuses in Palestinian detention, describing prisoners as 'hostages' and citing widespread detentions without due process. The article underscores the humanitarian, political, and legal dimensions of the conflict, emphasizing ongoing violations, dehumanization, and international legal scrutiny.",
