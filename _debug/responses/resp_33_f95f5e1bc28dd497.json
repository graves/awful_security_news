  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the ongoing U.S. government shutdown as of October 2025, highlighting that it is a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. It references the 2018–2019 shutdown as the longest in history, lasting 35 days and costing an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. This shutdown involved 800,000 federal employees, with 300,000 furloughed and 500,000 exempted from pay. The article attributes the recurring political deadlock to partisan gridlock, with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson overseeing a narrow House majority and lacking the 60 votes needed to end a Senate filibuster. The article notes that such shutdowns have become more frequent since 1990, with six occurring since 1990, and points to structural issues in Congress as a root cause of prolonged funding lapses.",
