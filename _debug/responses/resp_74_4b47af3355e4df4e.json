  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombians are deeply concerned as a diplomatic feud escalates between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Trump has accused Petro of being an illegal drug leader and threatened to cut off US subsidies and raise tariffs, which could severely impact Colombia’s economy—its largest trade partner. The US provides about $450 million annually in anti-drug aid, and a withdrawal of such support would have serious consequences. Colombian citizens, including taxi drivers, housewives, and students, express fear about economic hardship, visa access, and political disrespect. The conflict reflects deeper tensions over drug trafficking, sovereignty, and mutual respect between nations, with both leaders accused of speaking without regard for consequences while the real issue—systemic drug production and violence—remains unaddressed.",
