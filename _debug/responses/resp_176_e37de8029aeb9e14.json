  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "European leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have united in supporting a ceasefire that begins with freezing the current front line in Ukraine, aligning with US President Donald Trump’s call to halt fighting at the battle line. This position contrasts sharply with Russia’s opposition, represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who dismiss the front line freeze as temporary and insist that lasting peace must address root causes such as the recognition of Russian sovereignty over the Donbas and Ukraine’s demilitarisation. While Trump has publicly supported a ceasefire at the current line and previously suggested territorial concessions to Zelensky, he has since denied pushing for such a deal. Zelensky firmly rejects any withdrawal from Donbas, warning that it would enable future attacks. A potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest faces significant logistical hurdles due to Poland and Lithuania’s refusal to allow Putin’s passage under an international arrest warrant, though Bulgaria has offered to facilitate travel. The article underscores the deep divide between Western demands for immediate ceasefire and Russia’s maximalist, long-term peace proposals, highlighting the complexity and intractability of resolving the war after four years.",
