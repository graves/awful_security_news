  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Due to the government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, key CDC scientists were unable to attend IDWeek, the nation’s largest infectious disease conference, severely disrupting vital public health discussions on measles, whooping cough, bird flu, and superbugs. The shutdown has left federal scientists unpaid, with conference participation postponed unless funded externally. This absence comes amid rising disease threats and a history of administrative actions under the Trump administration that include funding cuts, layoffs, and restrictions on scientific communication. Experts like Michael Osterholm are stepping in to fill the gap by launching independent research initiatives such as Public Health Alerts. Meanwhile, concerns persist that HHS policies may be intentionally limiting the dissemination of scientific findings, raising serious questions about transparency and public health preparedness.",
