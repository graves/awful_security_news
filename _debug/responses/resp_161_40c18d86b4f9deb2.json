  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza are critically low, with only 750 metric tonnes entering daily—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to just two operational crossings: Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara. Despite an increase in distribution points from five to 26, the WFP stresses that full access is required to meet the population’s needs. The US-brokered ceasefire and Donald Trump’s 20-point plan are seen as vital for enabling large-scale aid, but access remains constrained by Israeli security restrictions, including the closure of the Rafah crossing and the lack of access to Salah al-Din Street. Hamas has committed to hand over 13 of 28 captives’ bodies, with two more delivered recently, which is a key condition for further opening crossings. Many Gazans are storing food due to fear of future disruptions, highlighting the fragility of the current humanitarian situation.",
