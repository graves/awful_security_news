  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration released two survivors from a failed military strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, undermining its claims of a war against 'narco-terrorists.' Despite assertions that the individuals posed an imminent threat—such as the claim that 25,000 Americans would die if the submarine landed—no public evidence supports the fentanyl trafficking allegations, and experts question both the geography and legality of the operation. The decision to release the men, rather than detain or prosecute them, appears to be a legal avoidance tactic, avoiding judicial review and habeas corpus challenges. The move raises serious concerns about the administration’s use of war powers without congressional authorization, transparency, and accountability. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and Republican lawmakers like Senator Todd Young, have questioned the legitimacy of the actions, with some calling for congressional action to halt the strikes.",
