  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown in October 2025, the Trump administration announced a plan to redirect tariff revenue — specifically from Section 32 and Section 232 tariffs — to fund the WIC program, which supports nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms, and young children. The move was made to prevent the program from closing within days due to a lack of federal funding, as Congress had not passed a spending bill for fiscal year 2026. While the White House claims the funds will be transferred through a Treasury general fund and potentially via a congressional designation, legal experts and advocacy groups raise concerns about the legality and transparency of the plan, citing that Congress has not formally appropriated funds for WIC. The National WIC Association stresses the need for long-term, stable funding rather than short-term fixes. The plan has drawn bipartisan attention, with House Speaker Mike Johnson blaming Democrats for the shutdown and calling the impact on vulnerable families 'shameful.' Despite the effort, advocates remain concerned about future funding, especially as the Senate and House proposals for fiscal year 2026 differ in funding levels and benefits.",
