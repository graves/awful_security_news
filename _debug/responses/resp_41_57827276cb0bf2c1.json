  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 21, 2025, CVS reported a network connection issue that prevented some of its over 9,000 U.S. pharmacies from filling prescriptions or providing flu shots, causing customer frustration and social media backlash. The company acknowledged the issue as a 'known system outage' and confirmed that service had been restored. The incident occurred just one day after a major AWS cloud outage that disrupted critical services globally, illustrating a broader societal vulnerability to digital infrastructure failures. While the CVS outage was not directly linked to the AWS event, both highlight the growing dependence on digital systems and the risks associated with their failure in essential services such as healthcare and communication.",
