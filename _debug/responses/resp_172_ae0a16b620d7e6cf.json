The WFP calls for all crossings, including Rafah and Salah al-Din Street, to be opened to ensure equitable and widespread aid delivery. The US-brokered ceasefire and Donald Trump’s 20-point plan are seen as essential for enabling full humanitarian access. Hamas has committed to returning 13 of 28 deceased captives’ bodies, with two more delivered as of 18:00 GMT on 21 October, and Israeli officials maintain the Rafah crossing remains closed. As a result, many Gazans are storing food due to fears of future supply disruptions, highlighting the fragile and unstable nature of the ceasefire.",
