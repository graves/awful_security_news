  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen daylight heist on October 20, 2025, four suspects broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris using power tools and a mechanical lift to gain access to the Gallery of Apollo. After entering at 09:30 and threatening guards, they stole eight valuable 19th-century royal jewellery items—including Empress Eugénie’s crown—before escaping on two scooters by 09:38. The heist occurred in a section with no CCTV in one in three rooms, and despite the museum’s wider alarms sounding, the localised alarm was reportedly broken. French officials, including Culture Minister Rachida Dati and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, condemned the incident as a serious blow to national heritage. Experts believe the stolen items will be broken and sold in parts to conceal the crime. The theft has triggered political outrage, with President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders calling it an attack on France’s cultural identity. This incident follows a pattern of recent museum thefts in France, including those at the Cognacq-Jay and Hieron Museums. The Louvre remains closed, and investigators are reviewing CCTV footage and searching for the suspects. The event underscores the need for improved security measures, especially given the Louvre’s previous calls for renovation under the New Renaissance project.",
