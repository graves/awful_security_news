    "New Jersey is experiencing a close gubernatorial race between Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.",

    "Personal attacks have intensified in the race, including Ciattarelli's claims about Sherrill being barred from walking at her Naval Academy graduation in 1994 and Sherrill's accusations that Ciattarelli's company downplayed opioid dangers, leading to tens of thousands of deaths.",
    "Sherrill has received endorsements from high-profile figures such as former President Barack Obama, while Ciattarelli has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.",
    "The campaign has become highly personal, with Ciattarelli's campaign threatening legal action over defamatory claims by Sherrill.",
    "Affordability and rising living costs, including a 17% to 20% surge in electricity bills in June 2025, are central concerns for voters.",
    "Both candidates have addressed cost of living, with Sherrill advocating for housing development and energy cost freezes, and Ciattarelli citing his background as a CPA to argue for better budget management.",
    "Political experts note that although Democrats have a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage, the race remains close due to voter priorities on affordability and personal campaign narratives."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are in a close, highly personal battle. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, is backed by former President Barack Obama and campaigns against Ciattarelli's ties to Donald Trump, while Ciattarelli, a former state Assembly member, received Trump’s endorsement and has criticized Sherrill’s academic history and opioid-related policies. The race is notable for its personal attacks—including claims about Sherrill’s graduation ban and Ciattarelli’s medical publishing company—and for voter concerns over affordability, with both candidates addressing rising energy and property costs. Despite Democrats having a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage, the state’s history of purple gubernatorial outcomes and recent polling showing a tie suggest a competitive race, with the final decision likely influenced by messaging on cost of living and trust in political leadership.",
