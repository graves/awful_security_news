  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a nearly two-and-a-half-hour phone call with President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to prevent the U.S. from supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which could target Russian cities. The call, described as 'positive and productive,' occurred amid rising tensions and a planned meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Putin emphasized that such weapons would not affect the battlefield but would damage U.S.-Russia relations, a concern he knows Trump values. He also praised Trump’s diplomatic success in the Middle East, particularly in brokering a Gaza ceasefire. A second face-to-face summit in Budapest, Hungary, was agreed upon, signaling renewed diplomatic efforts to resolve the Ukraine war. However, Russia has not changed its position on ending the war, maintaining that it will not compromise on its maximalist objectives, such as control over annexed Ukrainian territory and strict postwar constraints on Ukraine. The Kremlin’s strategy appears to rely on the prospect of a short-term diplomatic win rather than actual concessions, suggesting that personal engagement and the promise of progress may be more effective than substantive compromise.",
