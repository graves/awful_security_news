He says he is now focused on prison reform and does not plan to return to politics in the foreseeable future, stating he is 'all politicked out.' He also denies fraud, maintaining that his actions were driven by a chaotic political environment and that he will do what the law requires regarding restitution, though no further financial obligations are currently imposed.",
