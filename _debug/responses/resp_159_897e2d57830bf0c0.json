  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), led by the World Health Organization and including major donors like the Gates Foundation, is facing a $1.7 billion funding shortfall through 2029 due to reduced foreign aid—particularly from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This shortfall threatens to cut critical polio eradication activities, especially in high-risk areas like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where 36 wild polio cases were reported in 2025. To respond, the GPEI will shift focus to high-risk zones, adopt fractional dosing to conserve vaccine supplies, and strengthen collaboration with other health programs like measles vaccination. While wild and vaccine-derived polio cases have declined since 2024, continued funding and global cooperation remain essential to prevent a reversal of progress and achieve the goal of global polio eradication.",
