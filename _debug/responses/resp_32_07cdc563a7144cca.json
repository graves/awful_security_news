  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This marks a continuation of a political stalemate, similar to the 35-day partial shutdown in 2018–2019, which was the longest in history and cost an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. While previous shutdowns were partial and affected only some agencies, the current shutdown affects all operations. Key political obstacles include a narrow House majority and the lack of 60 Senate votes to overcome a filibuster, making legislative compromise difficult. The article highlights the economic and operational impacts, with around 800,000 federal employees affected, including furloughed and exempted workers who were not paid. The situation underscores how partisanship and structural legislative barriers contribute to prolonged government disruptions.",
