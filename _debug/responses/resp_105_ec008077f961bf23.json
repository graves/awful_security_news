  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge ordered the return of books on race and gender to five school libraries on U.S. military bases after students claimed their First Amendment rights were violated when nearly 600 books were removed due to policies issued by President Trump and DoD Secretary Pete Hegseth. These policies banned discussions on Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, and identity-based celebrations like Black and Women's History Months. Students, including children of active-duty service members, reported being punished for protesting and fearing classroom censorship. The ACLU filed a legal motion arguing that the removals were politically motivated, not pedagogically sound. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled that the actions were driven by improper partisan motives, and ordered the immediate restoration of all removed books and curricula.",
