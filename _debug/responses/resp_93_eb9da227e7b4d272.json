  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "British police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, in 2011 asked a bodyguard officer to investigate Virginia Giuffre’s criminal record—allegedly to smear her as a sexual assault victim trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. The probe follows revelations that Andrew maintained contact with Epstein as late as February 2011, contradicting prior claims, and comes amid public backlash over Andrew’s handling of the Epstein connection and denial of allegations. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, was a key accuser, and her family welcomed Andrew’s relinquishment of titles but urged the monarchy to take further action. Andrew settled a civil suit with Giuffre in 2022, admitting she suffered as a victim but denying wrongdoing. The case has sparked wider scrutiny of royal accountability, with officials like Ed Miliband condemning the use of security personnel in smear campaigns, and calls growing for King Charles III to revoke Andrew’s title as a symbolic act of justice.",
