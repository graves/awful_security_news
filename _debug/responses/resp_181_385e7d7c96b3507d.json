  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article debunks four common haircare myths: the belief that cold water increases shine, that split ends can be repaired with products, that cutting hair speeds up growth, and that hair can go without washing. Experts Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker, along with Professor Laura Waters, emphasize that healthy hair comes from proper scalp care and routine washing rather than expensive products or trendy habits. They warn against overuse of dry shampoo, incorrect claims about hair growth, and the dangers of allowing oil and debris to build up on the scalp. The article promotes evidence-based hair care, aligning it with the principles of personal skin health.",
