  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, is investigating whether federal agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are complying with her order to restrict the use of tear gas, pepper balls, and less-lethal force during protests in Chicago. The probe stems from allegations that agents deployed tear gas without prior warning and failed to use body-worn cameras, prompting a court hearing where officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, were questioned. Judge Ellis expressed serious concern that her order is not being followed and demanded accountability, including the potential deposition of former ICE Chicago field office head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino. This comes amid Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led crackdown in Chicagoland that led to over 1,000 arrests between September 8 and October 3. Protests continue at the Broadview ICE facility, with over 100 demonstrators and more than 30 arrests reported, reflecting ongoing public resistance to immigration enforcement actions.",
