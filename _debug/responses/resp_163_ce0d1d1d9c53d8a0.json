  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global call for improved early warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of countries lack sufficient monitoring and forecasting capacity. Over the past 50 years, weather, water, and climate-related hazards have caused over 2 million deaths, with 90% occurring in developing nations. The WMO highlights that 16% of assessed countries have less than basic alert systems, and progress is particularly limited in fragile and conflict-affected regions. Despite some advances—such as in Africa—the situation remains dire. Real-world examples like the 2025 glacier collapse in Switzerland, which led to the evacuation of Blatten, underscore the life-saving potential of early warnings. As climate change intensifies, the article stresses that timely alerts and early action are essential to saving lives and protecting economic and infrastructure assets worldwide.",
