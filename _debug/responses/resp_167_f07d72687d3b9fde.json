  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a landmark legal case consolidated in 2022, hundreds of claims from parents and school districts allege that social media companies, including Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube, designed addictive apps with features like 'likes' and notifications that harm young users' mental health. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, under Judge Carolyn Kuhl, has ordered key executives—Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel, and Adam Mosseri—to testify in person, rejecting arguments that in-person appearances were unnecessary. The court emphasized that CEO testimony is essential to assess whether companies knew of the harms and failed to act. Despite Meta and Snap claiming that their products are not liable under the 1990s Communications Decency Act, the judge ruled that claims of negligence and personal injury based on app design are valid. The trial, expected in January 2025, represents a major step in holding social media platforms accountable for their role in youth mental health issues, with legal advocates arguing that companies chose business over safety, and that design decisions contributed to addictive behavior.",
