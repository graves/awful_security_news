  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports on widespread allegations of torture, abuse, and executions of Palestinian detainees held by Israel, including documented cases of gang rape, physical violence, and burning. Bodies returned to Gaza from Israeli prisons show signs of severe torture, such as missing limbs, burns, and restraints, with many deaths occurring while restrained. Over 100 Palestinian prisoners are believed to have died in Israeli custody since October 2023, with bodies often returned without names. The Gaza ceasefire deal facilitated the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians, many of whom suffered long-term injuries and trauma from beatings and psychological torture. Key figures like Marwan Barghouti and Itamar Ben-Gvir are central to the allegations, with Ben-Gvir defending abusive prison practices. Human rights groups, including B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, have long documented systemic torture in Israeli prisons. Despite Israeli denials, international observers and medical experts confirm patterns of violence, including autopsies showing torture signs months after death. The article highlights a grave violation of international human rights law, with families left in despair and calls for urgent international investigations and accountability.",
