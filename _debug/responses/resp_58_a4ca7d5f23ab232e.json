  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department has filed a legal motion alleging that Patrick Fitzgerald, James Comey’s lead defense attorney, may have a conflict of interest due to his role in receiving or sharing communications involving classified information from Comey in 2017. Prosecutors claim that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified material, while Fitzgerald and his legal team argue that the memos were unclassified at the time they were shared and that no evidence exists of any classified information being released. The dispute centers on the classification status of seven memoranda written by Comey about his interactions with President Trump, which were later upclassified by the government. Fitzgerald cites a prior inspector general report finding no evidence of classified disclosures, and asserts that as an original classification authority, he himself determined the memos were not classified. Legal experts highlight the ethical dilemma of a lawyer acting as both a witness and a defense counsel in such a scenario, emphasizing the potential for bias or conflict. The case raises broader questions about transparency, accountability, and the integrity of legal representation in high-profile political controversies.",
