  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil’s Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas of Pará. The investigation uncovers a supply chain loophole: cattle raised illegally in protected zones—such as the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa sustainable area—are transported through an untraceable 'laundering' system via animal transit permits (GTA), which only track group-level data, not individual animals. This lack of traceability prevents JBS from verifying the legality of its beef and leather products. Despite past commitments to trace suppliers, JBS has failed to meet its 2011 pledge under the G4 Cattle Agreement. Pará, which has seen a 421% rise in deforestation since 2023, is also a hotspot for land grabs, with Indigenous communities facing violence and displacement. Federal and state governments are introducing traceability mandates by 2026 and 2032, respectively, but advocates warn such timelines are too slow. The article underscores urgent global concern over corporate responsibility, supply chain transparency, and the need for enforceable, publicly accessible traceability systems to combat deforestation and protect vulnerable communities.",
