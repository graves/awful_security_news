  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing a request from New Jersey Republicans to deploy federal election monitors to oversee mail ballot processing in Passaic County, a key battleground in the state’s November 4 gubernatorial race. The request stems from claims of a 'long and sordid history' of vote-by-mail fraud, including a 2020 incident in Paterson where 800 ballots were invalidated after mail-in ballots were found in mailboxes. While the county has shifted from Democratic to Republican support in 2024 — a major change from its history — the New Jersey Attorney General’s office and state officials argue that federal intervention is constitutionally inappropriate and contrary to state election responsibilities. The request reflects broader national debates over mail-in voting integrity, with Donald Trump having long questioned mail ballot systems, despite evidence showing no widespread fraud. The outcome in Passaic County could decisively influence the race between Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill.",
