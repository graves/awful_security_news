  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan’s parliament has elected Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as the nation’s first female prime minister. Her victory, secured through a last-minute coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, marks a historic shift in Japanese politics, breaking a long-standing gender barrier. However, her government lacks a majority, signaling potential instability. Takaichi’s administration is expected to pursue a rightward shift on social issues—including opposition to same-sex marriage and support for male-only imperial succession—while promoting government spending to stimulate economic recovery. This shift comes amid public frustration with deflation and rising prices, and has triggered a surge in the Nikkei share average. Despite the economic optimism, concerns remain about fiscal sustainability due to Japan’s high debt levels. The coalition with JIP, though politically significant, is fragile, and Komeito’s departure from the LDP underscores broader dissatisfaction with governance and corruption. Takaichi now faces key policy challenges, including domestic reforms and high-level diplomatic engagements, particularly with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
