  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the health crisis in Gaza is a 'catastrophe' that will last for generations, driven by famine, destroyed healthcare systems, disease outbreaks, and severe mental health issues. Despite a ceasefire brokered by the US on 10 October 2025, aid deliveries remain critically insufficient—only 200–300 lorries per day instead of the required 600—with supplies being confiscated and access to crossings restricted. Dr. Tedros criticizes Israel for weaponizing aid, imposing conditions on the return of hostages' remains, and blocking humanitarian access, calling for full, unimpeded access to ensure recovery. The UN estimates $70 billion is needed for reconstruction, with 10% dedicated to healthcare. Medical evacuation flights have been suspended for two weeks, resulting in 700 deaths from prolonged waiting. The article emphasizes that the ceasefire is fragile, humanitarian access remains inadequate, and long-term recovery depends on political will and international cooperation.",
