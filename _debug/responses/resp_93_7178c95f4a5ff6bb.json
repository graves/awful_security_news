  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a high-profile Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by President Donald Trump, American public opinion shows little enthusiasm for the agreement, with disapproval rates remaining high. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC indicate that Trump’s approval on the Gaza issue only marginally improved — from 37% to 47% — while overall approval dipped to a second-term low, with 61% disapproving. More significantly, public dissatisfaction with Trump’s economic management, especially inflation and the cost of living, has reached new lows, with 62% disapproving of his handling of inflation. Americans are also increasingly pessimistic about the economy, with declining confidence in economic improvement and wage growth. The article concludes that the public’s focus remains firmly on domestic economic issues, not foreign policy achievements, and that the fragile nature of the Gaza deal may not translate into political gains for Trump, especially in the face of persistent economic anxiety.",
