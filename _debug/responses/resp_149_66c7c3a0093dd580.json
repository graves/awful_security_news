  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of drone attacks, including suicide drone strikes near Khartoum international airport just before its scheduled reopening, have raised serious concerns about security and recovery in Sudan. The attacks, attributed to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), come amid ongoing conflict and the army’s efforts to restore civilian infrastructure. The airport has been closed since April 2023 due to damage from fighting, and its reopening is seen as a key milestone for national recovery. Despite the army’s recapture of Khartoum, drone attacks continue, with the RSF targeting military installations and civilian areas, including Omdurman. The broader conflict has led to massive displacement and humanitarian crises, and the potential fall of el-Fasher in Darfur could shift control of Sudan’s southern regions and trigger ethnic violence, with the United Nations warning of further atrocities. The attacks threaten both the airport’s reopening and the fragile peace efforts in Sudan.",
