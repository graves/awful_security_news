  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver is facing a three-count indictment for allegedly interfering with ICE officers during a legislative oversight visit to a facility in Newark, New Jersey, in May 2025. The incident involved her allegedly slinging her forearm and grabbing an agent during a confrontation. Her defense claims the action was part of her official legislative duties and protected under the Speech or Debate Clause, while prosecutors rely on surveillance footage and claim she attempted to obstruct a lawful arrest. The case has drawn political controversy, with McIver’s attorneys arguing it is retaliatory and politically motivated, especially in light of President Donald Trump’s criticism and his pardons of January 6 rioters. Judge Jamel Semper has ordered the removal of DHS social media posts that suggest McIver trespassed or that the incident involved Antifa activity, citing potential jury prejudice. Other Democratic lawmakers were present but not charged, raising questions about selective prosecution. The trial is scheduled for November 10, 2025.",
