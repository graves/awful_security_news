  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown in 2025, national parks like Grand Canyon, New River Gorge, and Yosemite face significant operational challenges due to furloughed National Park Service employees. While some tourists, like Nudrat Mahajabin, remain undeterred, the absence of rangers and entrance fees has led to safety concerns, including unauthorized drone use, base jumping, and increased trash and vandalism. Local businesses such as Mountain Mama and DC Trails report mixed impacts, with some seeing no decline and others facing reduced bookings. Meanwhile, nearby private museums in Washington, DC, have seen a surge in visitors due to the closure of the Smithsonian and National Zoo. Advocacy groups like the National Parks Conservation Association and the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks are urging park closures to protect safety and preserve visitor experiences. The shutdown’s economic impact on local economies—especially in tourism-dependent regions like West Virginia and DC—is a growing concern, with past shutdowns showing revenue losses of up to $47.4 million. Despite federal assurances that critical safety and emergency functions remain operational, long-term risks to park safety and community livelihoods persist.",
