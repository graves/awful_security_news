European officials reported that Trump grew frustrated, raised his voice, and pushed for a ceasefire along current battle lines, while Zelensky expressed pessimism about Trump’s position. Although Trump denied asking for a full surrender of Donbas, he stated that 78% of Ukraine’s land is already occupied and urged a ceasefire at existing frontlines. The meeting occurred amid growing tension between Trump’s demand for territorial compromises and Ukraine’s insistence on preserving its sovereignty. Trump’s shift in stance reflects his broader strategy to end the war quickly, influenced by his success in brokering a Gaza truce. While Trump maintained that both sides must make concessions, Ukrainian officials described the meeting as constructive with clear agreement on next steps, though the underlying dispute over territorial integrity remains unresolved.",
