  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the 2025 government shutdown, the White House announced a plan to use tariff revenue—specifically from Section 32 tariffs, which traditionally support child nutrition programs—to fund the WIC program, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. The move was prompted by fears that WIC would run out of money within days, as Congress had not passed a spending bill for fiscal year 2026. While the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it expressed concerns about the clarity, speed, and sustainability of the funding. The administration faced legal and procedural challenges, as Congress has not formally appropriated funds for WIC, raising questions about the legality of redirecting tariff revenue. The plan highlights the political and humanitarian impact of government shutdowns, with bipartisan figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson criticizing Democrats for damaging essential programs. Despite the temporary fix, advocates stress the need for long-term funding increases due to rising food costs and growing enrollment in WIC, which has increased to nearly 6.9 million participants.",
