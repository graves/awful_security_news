  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown, the White House announced that it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — typically allocated to child nutrition programs — to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million vulnerable families. The move was made after the program faced imminent funding shortfalls due to Congress’s failure to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. While the administration claims this is a 'creative solution,' legal experts and advocacy groups question the authority and sustainability of such a use, citing the lack of congressional appropriation. The National WIC Association welcomed the effort but emphasized uncertainty about funding levels, disbursement timelines, and long-term viability. The policy shift reflects broader political debates over the shutdown's impact on social programs, with Republican leaders blaming Democrats for halting services, while experts warn that without sustained funding, WIC remains at risk of instability despite bipartisan support and rising enrollment driven by inflation and improved access.",
