  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, has expanded her restraining order against the Trump administration’s use of excessive force during protests related to immigration enforcement, requiring all federal agents in Operation Midway Blitz to wear body cameras during encounters with protesters. The original order banned the use of tear gas, pepper balls, and other less-lethal weapons against peaceful demonstrators, journalists, and clergy. Following reports of aggressive tactics — such as tear gas deployment without warning and pepper balls fired at a pastor — Ellis expressed serious concerns that the administration is not complying. She demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court to explain the use of force. While the Department of Justice argues the body camera mandate is logistically unfeasible, the judge insists on transparency. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker supports the order, calling media reports accurate. Meanwhile, an appellate court blocked the federal deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, citing unreliable assessments of unrest. Internal friction exists between immigration and FBI agents over whether body cameras should be used, with some immigration agents refusing joint operations due to privacy and tactical concerns.",
