  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former Amazon delivery driver, Leah Cross, has filed a lawsuit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), accusing it of unlawfully abandoning her sex discrimination claim due to a Trump administration executive order that deprioritized 'disparate impact liability'—a legal framework used to address workplace discrimination even when policies appear neutral. Cross claims that Amazon’s delivery schedules make it nearly impossible for female drivers to use restrooms, forcing her to carry a portable urination device. The EEOC, under the executive order, has dropped investigations into multiple cases, including one involving Sheetz and others related to transgender workers, citing a policy shift that undermines protections for marginalized groups. The lawsuit demands that the EEOC resume its investigations, citing legal obligations from the 1991 Civil Rights Act. This incident reflects a broader political and legal challenge to civil rights enforcement, where federal agencies are accused of abandoning protections based on political ideology rather than legal or factual merit.",
