  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population, once in decline due to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements, has shown signs of recovery, with an estimated 384 individuals in 2025 — a rise of eight from the previous year. Scientists from the New England Aquarium and NOAA report that four mother whales produced calves, and some established mothers are having shorter intervals between births, indicating improved reproductive health. While the total number of calves (11) falls short of expectations, the entry of new females into the breeding pool is encouraging. Conservation measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence and ongoing protections under the Marine Mammal Protection Act are seen as vital to continued recovery. Experts remain cautious, noting that the species remains vulnerable, and environmental groups warn against policy rollbacks that could undermine recovery efforts.",
