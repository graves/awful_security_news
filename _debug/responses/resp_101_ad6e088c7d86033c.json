  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to build a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees major renovations in Washington, D.C. The project, announced in July 2025, is being privately funded by Trump and various corporate and individual contributors, with Carrier Global Corp. donating an energy-efficient HVAC system. The demolition has sparked concerns about disruption to the First Lady’s offices and potential violations of federal oversight procedures. While the White House claims the ballroom will not interfere with the main structure and will be completed by January 2029, the lack of formal approval and transparency in donor identities raises broader questions about accountability and historical preservation in government buildings.",
