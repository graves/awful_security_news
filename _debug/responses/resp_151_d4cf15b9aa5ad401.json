  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, tens of thousands of residents in Gabes, Tunisia, protested against the state-run CGT phosphate plant, which they allege has caused widespread environmental and health damage since its 1972 opening. The plant, responsible for releasing radioactive waste and phosphogypsum into the air and sea, has led to over 200 hospitalizations for respiratory distress and is blamed for rising cancer rates and marine life collapse. Despite a 2017 government pledge to phase out the facility, authorities have instead increased production, citing phosphate as vital to the economy. The powerful UGTT labor union led a general strike, shutting down schools, markets, and shops, and called for the plant’s immediate shutdown. President Kais Saied has responded by calling the crisis an 'environmental assassination' and blamed past administrations, while Chinese firms have been brought in to manage emissions. The protests represent a major test of Saied’s political authority and highlight deep public anger over environmental injustice and governmental inaction.",
