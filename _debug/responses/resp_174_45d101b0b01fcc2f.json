Despite tensions following a Hamas missile attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered Israeli air strikes killing dozens of Palestinians, both sides have reaffirmed commitment to the truce. Hamas has returned the bodies of 13 of the 28 deceased hostages, with Tal Haimi's remains confirmed. However, Israel continues to withhold participation in negotiations on a long-term peace plan until all dead hostages are returned. Only two aid crossings remain functional, severely limiting humanitarian access, especially in northern Gaza.
