  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amid a federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, will run out of funds by November, putting approximately 42 million Americans at risk of losing critical food assistance. The USDA has stated that its $6 billion contingency fund is insufficient to cover the projected $8 billion in November benefits. While the Trump administration has previously provided emergency funding for other programs, it has not committed to continuing SNAP benefits, instead blaming Democrats for political obstruction. A shift in tariff revenue helped sustain the WIC program but not SNAP. The situation has led 17 states to halt new food stamp applications, and advocacy groups warn that the lack of benefits during Thanksgiving will severely impact food security. Governor Kathy Hochul has condemned the administration's decision to suspend benefits as a deliberate act harming vulnerable families, underscoring the broader political and humanitarian consequences of the shutdown.",
