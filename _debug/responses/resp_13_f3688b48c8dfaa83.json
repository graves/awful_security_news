    "The Louvre Museum in Paris suffered a daylight robbery on Sunday, October 20, 2025, where around 100 investigators are now searching for the stolen high-value jewelry.",
    "The stolen items include a diamond and sapphire tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, an emerald necklace and earrings from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise in 1810, and other royal artifacts from the Napoleonic era. Eight of the nine items remain unaccounted for.",
    "The value of the stolen jewelry is estimated at 88 million euros ($102 million), making it one of the most significant art thefts in modern history.",
    "The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery through a window, armed with tools like an angle grinder and blowtorch, completing the heist in just seven minutes.",
    "Investigators have recovered one of the two scooters used by the thieves and a helmet believed to be worn by one of them, and are conducting a fume test on the truck to recover fingerprints and DNA.",
    "French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that security failures—such as unsecured windows and a basket lift on a public road—exposed the museum to such a heist.",
    "Experts, including author Elaine Sciolino and Art Recovery International founder Christopher Marinello, believe the jewelry may have been dismantled or melted to sell on the black market, making recovery highly unlikely.",
    "French senator Natalie Goulet believes the jewelry has already been taken abroad and used for money laundering, citing a possible link to organized crime.",
    "This heist is significant not only for its value but for its symbolic impact, as the Louvre is a national treasure and a symbol of French history and identity.",
    "The incident echoes past high-profile art thefts, such as the 1911 Mona Lisa theft and the 1998 Camille Corot heist, but this robbery is considered more severe due to the scale and value of the items and the lack of recovery prospects."
