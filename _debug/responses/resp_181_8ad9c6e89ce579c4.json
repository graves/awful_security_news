  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US Supreme Court is set to review a federal law that prohibits habitual illegal drug users from possessing firearms, after a lower court ruled it violates the Second Amendment. The Trump administration requested the review, arguing that such individuals pose unique dangers to society, especially when impaired and confronting law enforcement. Ali Hemani, a man alleged to be a regular marijuana user, was prosecuted under this law, and his legal team successfully challenged the charge, claiming it infringes on constitutional gun rights. The government counters that the law is narrowly tailored and allows individuals to regain gun access after quitting drugs. The case has drawn attention due to the involvement of Hunter Biden, who was previously prosecuted and pardoned under the same law. The debate reflects broader tensions between gun rights, drug policy, and constitutional interpretation, especially amid a conservative Supreme Court majority that generally supports gun rights but has previously upheld other restrictions.",
