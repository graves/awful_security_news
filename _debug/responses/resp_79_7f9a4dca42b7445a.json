  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During an ongoing government shutdown, national parks and Washington, DC tourism are facing significant challenges and shifts. While many visitors like Nudrat Mahajabin continue to access parks such as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite, the absence of park rangers and staff has led to safety risks including illegal drone use, base jumping, and trash buildup. Advocacy groups like the National Parks Conservation Association and the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks warn that limited staffing compromises emergency response and visitor safety. In West Virginia, parks remain open using state funding due to their economic importance, with local businesses like Mountain Mama cabins and West Virginia Adventures reporting mixed impacts. Conversely, private museums in DC, including Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum, have seen a surge in visitors due to closures of federal institutions like the Smithsonian and National Zoo. Despite these shifts, there is concern that continued shutdowns will harm local economies and create long-term environmental and safety problems. The situation underscores a broader tension between public access to natural spaces and the need for adequate staffing and safety measures.",
