  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew's ability to afford living at Royal Lodge is explained by a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate, in which he made a large upfront payment of approximately £8 million to cover renovations and eliminate future rent obligations. This arrangement, which included significant maintenance responsibilities and restrictions like no helicopters or gambling, was seen as financially beneficial to the Crown Estate due to the property’s security limitations. However, the deal has come under intense public and political scrutiny, especially following renewed allegations from Virginia Giuffre about Andrew’s past connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Critics, including government officials and political figures, argue that Prince Andrew should pay his fair share and leave royal residences, while the lease remains valid until 2078, allowing for continued residence by his ex-wife and daughters. The National Audit Office confirmed the renovation costs exceeded initial estimates, raising questions about the funding and transparency of the arrangement.",
