  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched legal efforts to have federal charges brought against him for allegedly lying during congressional testimony dismissed, claiming the prosecution is a result of a personal vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the prosecution is conducted by an illegitimate prosecutor. His legal team argues that Trump’s public attacks on Comey constitute retaliation for protected speech, and that the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney was unconstitutional because it bypassed the Senate confirmation process after the 120-day interim limit expired. The case is being challenged on constitutional grounds, with experts suggesting heightened judicial scrutiny due to the political nature of the prosecution. The defense also points to a prior dismissal of Trump’s own charges—over similar appointment issues—as precedent for the illegality of Halligan’s appointment.",
