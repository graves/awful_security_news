  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has launched a new AI-powered web browser called Atlas, designed to challenge Google’s Chrome by integrating deeply with its ChatGPT AI model. The browser removes the traditional address bar and introduces a paid 'agent mode' that uses ChatGPT to perform searches based on user browsing context, available only to ChatGPT subscribers. With ChatGPT reaching 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI is leveraging its growing user base to expand monetization through AI tools and partnerships with platforms like Etsy, Shopify, Expedia, and Booking.com. The rise in LLM usage—rising from 1.99% to 5.99% of desktop searches in a year—shows a shift in how users interact with the web, prompting increased AI competition. Experts remain skeptical that Atlas will significantly disrupt Chrome or Edge, as these browsers already offer AI features and users are loyal to familiar platforms. This development reflects a broader trend of AI integration into core internet services, with both OpenAI and Google investing heavily in AI-driven search and navigation.",
