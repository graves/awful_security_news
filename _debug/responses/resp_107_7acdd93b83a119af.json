  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has introduced sweeping new regulations requiring international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to re-register under strict ideological criteria, effectively threatening to shut down major humanitarian groups in Gaza and the West Bank. These policies, including approval from a committee with representatives from Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, are being used to de-register organizations that are perceived as supporting 'terrorist activities' or 'inciting racism,' even without clear definitions. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), the primary humanitarian provider in Gaza, has been banned from sending aid or staff, with Israel alleging it employs Hamas members—a claim without evidence. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, only two of seven border crossings are open, and many aid trucks have been waiting for months. Humanitarian organizations, including the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps, report being denied access or forced into appeals, while Israel has approved ideologically aligned or inexperienced aid groups. The restrictions severely undermine the delivery of food, medical supplies, and shelter to a population devastated by Israeli airstrikes, which have destroyed over 90% of homes and civilian infrastructure. The situation raises global concerns about the politicization of humanitarian aid and the erosion of access to life-saving assistance in conflict zones.",
