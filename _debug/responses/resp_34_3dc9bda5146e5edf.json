  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration proposed a federal funding compact with nine U.S. universities, offering preferential access to grants and federal partnerships in exchange for sweeping policy changes, including eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment at 15%, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes. The offer has been rejected by seven universities — including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College, and MIT — all of which argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House claims the compact fosters a more ideologically balanced higher education system, while university leaders emphasize that free inquiry and independent governance are essential to academic excellence. The proposal has sparked broader debate over the role of federal influence in higher education, with universities investing in lobbying and some, like the University of Texas at Austin, expressing openness to dialogue. A final decision deadline of November 21, 2025, creates urgency, while remaining schools, such as Arizona State, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis, have not yet responded publicly.",
