Students at schools in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy, and Japan reported being punished for protesting these actions and became fearful of discussing race and gender in classrooms. The ACLU filed a motion on their behalf, and Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles found that the book removals were not pedagogically justified but driven by improper partisan motives. The court ordered the immediate restoration of the removed books and curricular materials, highlighting a broader conflict between federal education policy and the constitutional right to free expression.",
