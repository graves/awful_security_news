  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans' access to long-term one-on-one mental health therapy at VA facilities is being severely restricted under a policy intensified since 2021, particularly under VA Secretary Doug Collins. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell report being abruptly cut off from therapy despite ongoing clinical needs, especially for chronic conditions like PTSD. Providers say they face disciplinary action for pushing back, and patients feel abandoned, re-traumatized, and distrustful of alternatives like group therapy. While the VA claims no session limits exist and promotes shared decision-making, providers and veterans argue the policy undermines clinical appropriateness and trust. The American Psychological Association is reviewing the situation, emphasizing that recovery-oriented, individualized care should be based on patient-therapist collaboration, not rigid administrative mandates.",
