    "It is extremely difficult to beat the market, and most actively managed funds do not outperform passive index funds over time.",
    "A KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart) investing strategy—using a few low-cost index funds—can lead to better long-term results than trying to select 'best' funds or managers.",
    "Target-date retirement funds automatically adjust asset allocation based on age and retirement date, making them a smart, low-effort option for most investors.",
    "For those who prefer more control, a simple portfolio of US stocks, international stocks, and investment-grade bonds can be effective and easier to manage.",
    "For intermediate-term goals (5–10 years), a high-quality bond index fund or a low-cost, actively managed one may offer better performance than other options.",
    "Simplicity reduces decision fatigue, improves portfolio transparency, and makes it easier to pass on investments to heirs or caregivers in case of cognitive decline.",
    "Ultimately, even with strong returns, insufficient savings will prevent reaching financial goals—so simplicity helps investors recognize the need to save more."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article, authored by Jeanne Sahadi for CNN, promotes a 'KISS' (Keep It Simple and Smart) investing strategy that emphasizes simplicity and low-cost index funds over complex, actively managed portfolios. It cites Morningstar data showing that only 21% of active funds outperformed passive ones over 10 years, and just 7.1% of large-cap blend funds did so over 20 years. The article recommends either a target-date retirement fund—automatically adjusting risk over time—or a simple portfolio of U.S. and international stocks plus bonds for those seeking more control. It also highlights the psychological benefits of simplicity, including reduced decision fatigue, easier portfolio review, and clearer inheritance planning, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The key takeaway is that most investors can achieve strong long-term results without actively selecting funds, and that financial success depends more on consistent saving than on complex investment strategies.",
