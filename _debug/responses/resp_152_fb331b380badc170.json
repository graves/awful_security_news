  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, citing their tendency to provide biased, polarized, and distorted political advice. Testing revealed that these models frequently recommended fringe parties like the Party for Freedom (PVV) and Green Left-Labour Party, while largely ignoring centrist parties such as Democrats 66 and People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The authority warns that such AI guidance undermines democratic integrity by misaligning voter choices with actual policy preferences and emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in AI systems. This comes amid the upcoming October 29 parliamentary election, where the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, is expected to win the most seats despite lacking coalition support, highlighting the tension between populist sentiment and stable coalition governance in the Netherlands.",
