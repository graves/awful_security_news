  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching a groundbreaking 7-mile-long artificial reef project called Reefline, which blends marine science and art to restore a historic coral reef lost in the 1970s. Led by coral scientist Colin Foord and arts curator Ximena Caminos, the project features underwater concrete sculptures—such as cars and starfish—designed to support coral growth. Foord’s coral nursery grows over 2,000 soft coral specimens, including gorgonians, which will be transplanted into shallow waters off Miami Beach. The project is funded by a $5 million city bond and aims to raise $6 million more, with public access from the shore. Over time, the sculptures will be colonized by coral, transforming into vibrant underwater ecosystems. The initiative not only restores ecological balance but also creates a unique ecotourism destination and a lasting cultural symbol for the city.",
