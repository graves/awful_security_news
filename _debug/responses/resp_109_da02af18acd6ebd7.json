  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching a groundbreaking 7-mile-long artificial reef called Reefline, combining marine science and public art to restore a lost coral habitat and create a sustainable, accessible underwater destination. Led by coral researcher Colin Foord and artistic director Ximena Caminos, the project involves cultivating resilient corals such as gorgonians in nurseries before transplanted onto underwater sculptures made from marine-grade concrete, including cast cars and giant starfish. The reef, located 700 feet off Miami Beach at depths of 15 to 20 feet, will be visible from the air and accessible to swimmers, offering both ecological restoration and ecotourism. Funded in part by a $5 million city bond and aiming to raise $6 million more, the project is expected to take at least a decade to complete and will include a marine learning center to educate the public on coral reef conservation. Reefline not only restores what Miami Beach lost in the 1970s but also represents a fusion of art, science, and community engagement, with potential symbolic value as a future icon of the city.",
