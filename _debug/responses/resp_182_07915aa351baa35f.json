From Theodore Roosevelt's construction of the West Wing in 1902 and FDR's indoor swimming pool for therapy, to Harry Truman's extensive 1948–1952 renovation that included a bowling alley, and Jacqueline Kennedy's 1960s restoration with a televised tour and restoration of the Resolute Desk, these changes have shaped both the building and public perception of the presidency. More recently, Barack Obama transformed a tennis court into a basketball court, and current renovations under a new administration include a new ballroom and modernized spaces like the Rose Garden and Oval Office. These renovations are not just physical updates but cultural symbols of how presidential leadership evolves over time.",
