  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is actively investigating federal law enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation in Chicago that resulted in over 1,000 migrant arrests. In response to concerns about the use of force and lack of warnings, Ellis expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for all agents on the ground during protests. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras, ICE Special Response Teams are not, and no cameras have been issued to them. Testimony from federal officials reveals that agents are trained in crowd control and press interactions, but incidents like the one involving pastor Rev. David Black—where he was struck with pepper balls without warning—raise serious questions about compliance, transparency, and accountability. The federal leadership has been described as a 'revolving door,' with key officials like Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino departing the area, making on-the-ground continuity and oversight difficult. The judge plans to continue questioning top officials, underscoring ongoing legal and public scrutiny of federal responses to protest activity in Chicago.",
