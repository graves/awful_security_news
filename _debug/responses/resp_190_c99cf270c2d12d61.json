  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen daylight robbery on Sunday, October 20, 2025, thieves broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris and stole eight high-value jewels, including the Empress Eugénie's tiara, escaping on scooters within eight minutes. Experts believe the stolen items were professionally dismantled—gold and silver melted, diamonds cut into smaller stones—making it extremely difficult to track or recover them. Dutch art detective Arthur Brand and jewellery historian Carol Woolton suggest the thieves were professionals linked to organized crime, possibly involved in money laundering. The total value of the loot is estimated at up to £10 million, with larger stones worth around £500,000 each. Despite hopes of recovery, the items are likely already sold or melted. The incident has caused deep public shock in France, where the jewels are seen as shared national heritage, evoking a sense of national loss akin to losing the Mona Lisa.",
