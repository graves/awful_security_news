  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Ghizer, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing cloud formations, animal behavior, and using sound signals like gunfire—is being relied upon to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite significant government spending on early warning systems (EWS), including the $37 million GLOF-II project, communities report widespread distrust due to equipment failures, lack of real-time communication, and poor community engagement. Real-life examples, such as shepherd Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, show how traditional human-based warnings successfully saved lives when technological systems failed. The article highlights Pakistan’s status as one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, with rising temperatures and glacier melt increasing flood risks. It calls into question the effectiveness of technology-driven systems without community trust, emphasizing that Indigenous knowledge remains a vital, resilient, and under-recognized tool in climate adaptation.",
